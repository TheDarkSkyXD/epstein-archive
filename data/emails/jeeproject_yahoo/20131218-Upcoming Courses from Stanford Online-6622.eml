                <p style="float: left; width: 390px;margin:0; padding:0;margin-left: 10px;">This course is the first course in the Theoretical Minimum series and explores the mathematical physics developed by Isaac Newton (1642 - 1727) and later by Joseph Lagrange (1736 - 1813) and William Rowan Hamilton (1805 - 1865). Participants will be immersed in a discussion of the allowable laws of physics; delve into Newtonian mechanics; and study three formulations of classical mechanics by Lagrange, Hamiltonian and Poisson respectively. This 11 segment, self study course began on December 7, 2013 and focuses on the relation between symmetries and conservation laws, with a consideration of electromagnetism and the application of the equations of classical mechanics to a particle in an electromagnetic field. <br/>
