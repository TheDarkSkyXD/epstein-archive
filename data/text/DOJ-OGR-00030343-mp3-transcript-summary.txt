Um, during your time of employment there, um. What was your relationship with Mr. Epstein like? Um, well, he mostly wanted to be alone, and that's an important matter. So sometimes I would have to call New York to his secretary for his personal assistant so I could talk to him, because we're not supposed to go to the second floor. When he was there most of the time. Okay. All right.

Um, so if he was in residence and he was in his room in the master bedroom. Yes. And you needed to speak to him. You couldn't? No, I couldn't. That was out of the question for all of us. Um, you know, there were four people at the time helping me and running the compound. Who were the four people that were helping him? Okay. Okay. He would be most of the day. But, you know, when he left, they weren't supposed to be there, you know?

Um, beautiful girl, inside and out. Okay. How old would you say she is? Uh, I would be, I think, 24, 23, something like that. Okay. All right. And then she would in turn tell me that she needed to see him, and we wouldn't bother him unless, like, you know, it was a real, you know, he would get not angry, but, I mean, he wouldn't like any of us going upstairs. And when we notice, he will go away, and then we go upstairs and fix the room, you know, and make sure that everything else.

Okay.

After guests left, the staff would tidy up, following a manual to ensure everything was in order. The speaker describes routines for cleaning and maintaining the house.

If you had guests come over and they went upstairs after he left his room, would you go upstairs and tidy up or not? Well, I would greet them and I'll be sure that whoever they are. And they usually give me a list of the people who will go, and I will make them feel comfortable in the kitchen, offering a drink. And then he can sometimes give me orders to send these people upstairs.

Okay. So they would go upstairs. First of all, who would give you a list of people who's coming right at that time? So-and-so is coming. Coming. Okay. Um, and then you would make them comfortable in the kitchen, and either he would come down or I would come down there at that time. I would go to the staff house. I'll step out of the house and he will take over. He would go to the cabana or the swimming pool or.

Okay. When the guests would leave and Mr. Epstein would come downstairs, would you go upstairs to clean or tidy up? No, not with him in the bedroom. No, no, no, he would come downstairs. Oh, yes. Okay. Now, you know, sometimes we have times we need to be there, but not to be heard. So we ran upstairs and picked up the towels in the bathroom and everything because, you know, we have a manual that everything has to be tidy in a certain way.

So that's our routine. Okay.

## Massage Visits and Description of Girls

 The speaker details the regular visits by girls who came to provide massages to Epstein, noting that this occurred twice daily when he was in residence. The girls appeared very young, and the speaker expresses uncertainty about their ages, stating that they never saw identification but some seemed possibly underage.

When he was in residence, um, would there be certain girls coming by to go see him for massages?

Yes. Yes. Every day. Every day when he would be in. Yes. Okay. One in the morning, one in the afternoon.

Twice a day?

Yes. Okay. Okay. 

Describe his girlfriend.

Um, he will have prior to me coming to the house. He will for some reason. He will pick up from a long list. I guess a lot of people like to do those because they are nice-paying jobs, but they are nice people that can, you know, and they will give us sometimes to him and to his companions.

And, and they were nice in the sense that, you know, I remember one day she was starting to get pregnant, but she lived in Palm Beach Gardens, I guess, and she was very nice. I mean, you know, you think these people are, you know, in general nice people. You know, I cannot say anything. Okay.

Did they appear young to you?

Yes. They were young, you know. You know, I never see anybody all the time. 28 or something like that.

Anybody younger than 18?

It's hard to say that, sir. You know, there were a lot of girls that were very, very young. But, you know, for me to say they were minors, you know, it's, you know, I'd never see the driver's licence for them, you know. They appear very young there.

Do you recall any of the names of the girls? 

I have to. See. I have some notes that I have a manual that I used to because I used to call them once in a while. And I don't recall it right at this moment, but, um, I know who they are. And some. They live in town. In Palm Beach or in. Um, some out west.

## Rental Car Incident and Record Keeping

 The speaker recalls renting a car for one of the girls at Epstein's direction, describing the type of car and the process. They mention keeping notes and a manual to track names and details, but express difficulty recalling specific names without consulting their records.

Do you remember that girl's name?

Um, I rented a car to her, but I don't, to be honest with you. I don't remember exactly.

I rented a car for.

Yeah, he asked me to rent a car for her. For me? What kind of car was he? Was a Dodge Neon, a dark Bosnian colour. Um, I think it was a blue Neon. $1. Rent a car from Dollar. Yes. Okay. He was my driver's licence. You saw it, right? Did you add that person as an additional driver or. And what? Yeah. Is that person an additional driver. Exactly. Okay. Was this the direction of Mr. Epstein or.

Yes. Okay. So, Mr. Epstein, whatever I do, I have to be with the blessing of it, right? You know? Okay. How, how, um, how long ago was this? Do you remember this? Um, I think January of 2005. February. I have to go back then because. Because it was a rental company and they called me that day. The rental was expiring, so I need to go and rent for another month. So she ran for another two weeks, I think. Okay.

Do you remember this girl's name?

Um. Um. I know, but, I mean, I probably have to sit down, and there are so many, but I can get back to my head.

## Number of Girls and Staff Roles

 The speaker estimates that as many as 15 different girls visited for massages, though the exact number is uncertain due to their own absences. They describe the staff's behind-the-scenes roles, including the chef, and the routines followed when the girls were present, such as staying out of sight and managing logistics.

How many girls would you say came over?

Different girls with him and his friends. Usually four or five. No, but he was in residence to come over and do a massage. Sometimes as many as 15. Um, but it's hard to say because sometimes I was away. I was supposed to only buzz in on the staff house, and the chef would come to the house, and we were supposed to be there because, you know, they go to the swimming pool, you know? You know, sometimes you are kind of shy to go and say, you know, to tell you if he called me, I will go in. But, you know, they didn't do something like that.

Okay. So they would go out to the pool. They would. Well, this is the thing that we used to sneak because they are fine. Once they leave, you know, it's like we are behind the scenes. Necessarily people, you know. Okay.

Who was the chef then?

Um, David. Um. David. Um. I forgot his last name. He came from New York or with them? Oh, okay. All right. Okay.

## Massage Room Cleaning and Items Found

 The speaker describes the process of cleaning the massage room after visits, including picking up towels, massage oils, and vibrators. They mention procedures for labelling and storing personal items found in the room, such as clothing, and note that some items would upset Maxwell if moved or reported.

When they would come over to do the massage, you say it was twice a day when he was in town. One morning. One afternoon when he would leave the room, would you go upstairs and straighten out? Yes. Okay. Um, did he have his massage table? Yes. Okay. Okay. We put him away, and we pick up the towels, the towels, the massage oils and, you know. So.

Okay, was there anything else that you would have to pick up in the room?

Uh, everything that was on the floor. No, but what? It included that. You know what? Cleaning the room. Sometimes. We used to find items that we were supposed to label where we found them and everything else. But, you know, when Mismatch would come to town, she. She wanted those items to be returned. But sometimes she was getting upset because those items. So it was kind of a catch-22.

We used to keep them in the laundry room for a while when nobody came and we took them away. Okay.

When you cleaned the room, were there other things that you would pick up? Uh, aside from the massage stuff, was there any? Like sex toys?

Uh. No, sir. There was only one place. I never find them on the floor. Okay.

Would you have to pick those things up when he was done?

Um, no. I never saw one before. Okay. There was only one place, and I never see them out of there. Okay.

Any vibrators and massagers? 

Well, he had a lot of vibrators for his body. I presume that they were lying all over the floor. So we picked up those. And the recharger, you know, and like I said, there was a procedure to get everything in place. And, you know, I put fresh towels and that was a heavy job. I have to say, because there was a lot of towels there driving.

## Departure from Employment and Confidentiality Agreement

 The speaker explains that they left due to burnout from understaffing and demanding hours. They mention being required to sign a confidentiality agreement and express concerns about potential repercussions for discussing their experiences, but emphasise their loyalty and discretion during employment.

Your departure from his, from his employment. Was that a good thing?

I was born out there. I was burned out because I was hired to have staff, and I think I was understaffed. And he had his breakfast at 6:30 in the morning. And sometimes he'd call me in the house to fix a meal at 10:00 pm or something like that. So, and the next day you have to be up. You know, I am a married man. So my wife was in Miami, so I was looking forward to the days off. And so that's the thing.

After six months, I began to burn out, I think is the right description. But I think I served him well with loyalty and discretion, you know, and we have to sign a confidentiality agreement.

There was an agreement?

Yes, sir. In many cases, I would say this in front of you because I know you're the law. But we found that we signed that. And I don't know if we have any repercussions for me talking about this, but I know you. You will abide. So you know.

## Contact with Security and Private Investigator

 The speaker recounts being contacted by Epstein's security department and a private investigator named Bill Riley, who offered legal counsel and took extensive notes during their meeting. The speaker's wife advised against accepting an attorney, and the speaker expresses their intent to be honest and cooperative.

Okay. Um, well, also, you're under subpoena, too. So, um, were you contacted by anybody from the house? And after we spoke or before we spoke?

I called him. And I was telling him I was very curious to see and I know what I'm getting into, but I was trying to tell him that, you know, there's an investigation. And then he told me, well, I have, you know, what do you know? And I said, well, the head of my security department is going to contact you. So I got this gentleman by the name of Bill Riley. He contacted me and we spent two hours in a hotel.

Okay.

We spoke this morning, too, but that was my direct link to them. And when I was subpoenaed for today, I tried to contact them. But, you know, they said that they were advised by their attorneys not to talk to anybody. So this is all the communication I have with him. Okay.

You spoke with Mr. Riley again today?

Yes. Yes. I told him that I was close, and here was the building. And that's what I asked him, you know. And he said fine. He said, call me when everything is done.

What is it that he wants you to know? I mean, what is it that he wants to know?

He said that he wanted to provide me with an attorney. And then my wife told me, you don't need an attorney because you haven't done anything wrong, Mr. Attorney. So that's the reason, you know, I came, you know, and I have, you know, I never have been in this situation before, so I, I think my wife would have this bright light to say, no, don't take any attorney because you're not hiding anything. And I'm very honest with you.

Okay. Um, what is it that Mr. Riley wanted to know from you?

Um, why? I don't know why I don't want an attorney if I don't have anything to hide. You know, so I'm going to be honest, you know, I didn't. What I see is, you know, I'm a working man. You know, I work for another, you know, old man, in Fort Lauderdale. And you can check my background. And I've never been in trouble. So I don't want to think that my boss, that I'm doing something that was illegal or something like that.

Okay, you know, you're not compelled to speak with Mr. Riley, the private investigator. You're not. You don't have to speak to him if you don't want to. You know, um, and what we discuss here, I hope that would stay between us. This is an ongoing investigation. Uh, Mr. Riley wants to know what I'm doing. You know, I'll give you my card, and he can call me, okay? Okay. Um. When you spoke with him, you said you spoke with him two hours in the hotel.

What is it that he wanted to know from you?

Well, he took notes in a pack like that, and he said, how long was I in for that? He knew what I did over there because he's working for me. But he asked me, um, you know, some questions, like you asked me about people who went there and what was my routine. And so he said, what do I think? I said, I don't know, you know. Then again, he didn't ask me for names, but, you know, he took a lot of notes. We spent a good two hours there.

When you would go upstairs and clean the bedroom area. Um, you know that there were some vibrators slash massagers, sex toys, uh, in the bedroom. Where were they kept?

I knew from men in front of his bed, his dresser that he opened, and he had videos. And he has his faults.

Okay. In your opinion, or do you feel that there was more than just a massage going on in the rooms?

We all need it. We all need that. Um, he was kept under such tight security because he will be close. You shatter no light in this room. In the second floor. Natural light. And when he left, we opened that and let the whole thing air out. But he was always first. He told me they need to be closed.

## Security, Cash Handling, and Employment Referral

 The speaker discusses their responsibilities related to security and cash handling, including managing large sums of money and ensuring nothing was lost. They explain how they were referred for employment by contacts working for Leon Black, and describe the trust placed in them due to previous incidents with other staff.

How did you, how did you get employed with Mr. Martin? How did you know about it?

Two friends. I was born in Bolivia, in South America, and I had two friends of mine that they were working for the Leon Blacks in New York, and it looked like he had a couple of Filipinos that they stole from him in the past. And so he was looking for a very, you know, people like me, you know, he can rely on, you know, because we used to keep a lot of cash in the house. They were gone.

Mhm.

Um, but you know, I was the only one opening and closing the face because even if there are 10,000 in the safe that you open, and you know, that was another thing. But he never lost. I never lost a penny, but I was in charge that they didn't want to go in and open the safe. He said, "You give me the money." And so I was referred by the Leon Blacks. They gave me a recommendation for me to be employed by Mr. Epstein. Okay.

Is there any relation to the blackout in Miami?

He owns a company called Apollo. I think the compound is a huge house in Bedford Hills, New York. Okay. That's how I came on board.

## Relationship with Maxwell and House Procedures

 The speaker describes Maxwell's long-term presence and her reactions to personal items found in the house, such as clothing left by girls. They explain the procedures for reporting and storing these items, the labelling system for rooms, and the importance of discretion in handling sensitive matters.

Mr. Maxwell, is that his?

His name is Michael. He has been with him for 14 years at the end of Mary. And so sometimes he will have to go to another bedroom. And something was going on there. I never understood the relationship, but, you know, like when I...

Was a massage.

Or...

Some girl was over.

Yeah. She will take a second place. Okay. And somehow they are not doing any respect. And, you know, they make... I have to say that talking to my heart, you know, they make a beautiful couple. You know, we try to say Merry Christmas, but they always have this separation of things, you know? So it's hard to understand.

What when you said that she would become upset when things were moved? What kind of things were moved?

You know, intimate. Hear from the girls and...

Stuff that the girls would live there.

Under the bed, you know, because we have to clean and we have to turn everything around every day and report back with the date. And because the rooms, they have colours, we used to say yellow room, the white room or the pink room. And so we labelled those. So these are like, uh, either panties or bras, that type of thing. Most of the time it was because they were small.

But who wanted to hold on to them?

It wasn't a manual, sir. I don't know. But, you know, we're supposed to turn everything in, and somebody. Would you turn it in to us. We put it in the laundry room. But sometimes they were so busy, and that's what they came to. And they stayed there for weeks. But we mentioned that we found something, but I knew that that was going to upset her. So sometimes we don't mention that.

But they were there. If she asked what did you find?

They were there. 

But you were talking to Miss Maxwell or Miss Maxwell? 

No, no, he didn't want to see that thing. Okay, Miss Maxwell. Okay. 

Was there ever any men that came to give him massages?

No, sir. No, I never see them. No. Okay. Have you?

Did Mr. Riley or Mr. Epstein promise you anything or offer you any gifts in exchange for not speaking to me?

No, sir. No. Have they offered you anything? Okay. All right.

And during your six months? Approximately 15 girls. How many times did you? Would you say you saw them? 

Well, I'd read them, you know, because when the phone was ringing, I was supposed to answer the phone and the door. So I told them, you know, a lot of times. And it's mind-boggling because it's so many names I have to remember.

And the rotation. So they traveled with him on some. They came back, you know, sometimes, you know, I have to tell him you should go to work. I have my checkbook and buy them stuff and work for them. Or I rent a plane for two hours, make them happy, you know, and they would go on trips. They would go on trips? Yeah. He owns an island in San Tomas, a house in France, the biggest house in Manhattan, the biggest ranch in New Mexico [Ed note: Zorro Ranch], in Palm Beach.

Okay. Did any of these girls ever fly with him to New York or anywhere else?

Yeah, all the time. Okay.

Which was it? The girl that you rented a car for?

She went to New York, I think, for the island, but I'm not sure. But yeah. Yeah. Okay.

Any other girl that you can think of might have gone on trips with him.

Uh, well, all of them. 

Did you know they came? 

Actually, Larry, the chief pilot, would call me from the plane, and he said I felt I needed to get into suburban aviation and such. And so the jet will be there next to Lonesome. So we arranged, and he would go into one Mercedes. He would drive himself with three girls, and he'd go, and I would love him because he said I was supposed to follow him. He would go someplace. And I followed with the rest of the girls and the baggage car, and I would sometimes help you guys drive me, but I didn't know how many were coming because that was another thing I needed to prepare the meal.

I have flowers in the house, and you know, so you never know.

## Payment to Girls and Security Concerns

 The speaker elaborates on their multiple roles, including driver and security, and describes incidents involving cash payments to girls for massages. They recount a security concern involving a suspicious visitor and their decision to report it to the police, which upset Epstein. The speaker expresses mixed feelings about the nature of the massages and the ages of the girls.

Because sometimes when the chef wouldn't come, I needed to double as So.

You were like a man of many hats?

Yeah, I was a driver. Security. And I have to say this. I went to the Palm Beach Police Department one time because I was by myself. And he would give cash gifts to this girl that I came back from Publix, and I found an old car in the driveway. And sometimes we used to keep the gate open because we had the sense not to bother with it. We left it open. So I found this car, and I was walking inside.

Hello. Hello. I found this girl, very young, with an older boyfriend. But the appearance did scare me. I just drove off the street straight to the police department. And then you got upset. 

Why?

I went to the police department. But I was again for the security. Because these girls know I was supposed to be carrying $2,000 in my pocket at all times to take a taxi driver, girls, and everything else. They look at me like an ATM machine, basically.

And how much would you give them when they would come by for a test?

400, 500, 600, 1000. Depends. On the amount.

Would Mr. Abney pay them personally for the massage, or would you pay them for them? You would pay them? 

Yes. Or.

I didn't have any cash in the weekend. I would have, or they told me, get into the safe and get, you know. But that was my petty cash per se, because we were supposed to have all the money in the Mercedes. All the cars have $200. Okay. So when he told me that, you know, when he left, he said that that instance, they brought us in a collision course. And that's when he got upset with me because I went to the police.

Because the police knew that they were not. You know, there was something else.

Did you feel that they were misusing?

No. Some. Some they were and some they weren't.

Okay. Out of those 15 people that you saw during your six months, how many were those? Would you say were not? This was.

The majority.

The majority?

Yeah.

Okay.

Did you ever see any money exchanged for massages?

No.

No.

He would tell me, get the money, but then I would get out of the house and I'll find the empty envelope on the floor, you know, with no money. Okay.

So, in essence, Mr. Epstein or his assistant would then pay them because you would leave the house, right?

Exactly. That's exactly.

True. 

Okay. 

So you were. You were given the cash, but he would actually be the one that paid him.

I would pay some of them because I will tell you, I was shopping or doing something. And she said, give this to Susan, or 300 or 500 or 600, and that's how I make envelopes and come back to the majority of the time, I'll give him the cash and they will distribute the money. He will never touch the money. Most of the time. 

So. What are you saying? 

I don't know if I went to high school. Sir. Taking flowers for a girl. But I feel I have two daughters myself. And at that time, it doesn't look bad. I know what he's getting into. I have a friend who works in a jewellery store. What's happening? And he said that when my daughter was. So I took a bunch of roses. But then I realised that she was probably very young, and he was in the house.

And she provided him with roses.

And I don't know what he did, but she spent hours now. So most of the time they want they have a sauna next to the bathroom, next to the master bedroom. And they would sometimes I would go and knock on the door and nobody would answer, but I find it too young to make it to the earphones or something. So I just like the devil. I get out of the house and I told everybody, don't go out there until we have to make a left.

So.

## Gifts, Deliveries, and Shopping for Girls

 The speaker recalls delivering flowers to a high school for one of the girls at Epstein's request, feeling uncomfortable due to the girl's apparent youth. They describe shopping for gifts, such as electronics, and clarify that they did not buy intimate apparel or jewellery, but did purchase items like iPods and computers.

So you've taken flowers. Have you taken anything out to the high school? Which high school was that again?

I do remember her, but I don't have the name with me right now. But it was like, um, um, end of the year, they make it and it's like a play, you know. And when they finish, I was supposed to say, this is from Jeffrey. Thank you. Congratulations and leave, you know. But a bunch of their friends, they came to me and said who I am because I was in a black Mercedes, you know, and this and that.

So? 

So that was one instance that I feel awkward because I am a father of two girls.

And he knew that this girl was going to.

I don't think he did. I was given the address by some flowers from Clematis. Distinctive flowers, I think it was a small shop I used to buy the flowers from. I went over there, but, you know.

Did you deliver anything else to the school other than the flowers?

No, that was the only time I went there.

Um. Obviously. Um, he has another friend slash assistant.

Yeah. Oh, yes.

What is she to him?

He can draw water into them. Uh. The given. Is it safe to be different because he's like, he will do special things for her trouble only with her sometimes. 27 and so she was a special attention and she was very, very sweet, very nice, very young. Um, so by the time when I finished my employment, that was the difference that took the place of all the others.

So she would obviously sleep with him in his room and everything.

Well, sometimes he would go to pick up his bathrobe in her, in her bedroom, you know. So it's something obvious. And I don't know what happened to her, but I mean, she was very, very nice and. Okay.

Did you ever see Nadia with any of the masseuses?

No, because when the massage was going on, it was everything on the second floor. I never see them. You know how they were done. Okay.

Do you have this stuff written down in a book? In the manual? Yes.

I have some of the names there.

Okay. Is it possible that you can provide me with that book?

Yes, sir. Um. Do you have it with you now? No, I have it in Miami.

My house? Yes.

Okay. Um, I would definitely like to take a look at that book. Um, I have.

To say this, you know, this.

Will.

Help me.

## Final Fears, Cooperation, and Conclusion

 The speaker expresses fears about the power and influence of Epstein and his associates, worrying about potential retaliation. They affirm their willingness to cooperate with the investigation and are reassured by the investigator that they are not a suspect. The investigator offers support and requests access to the speaker's records, concluding the interview.

I had a hint that this investigation was something about that. But I have to say also that this friend of mine that works in a CrossGen, this is a jewellery store. It's a long-time friend of mine, and then he was also in the fact that I believe the flowers delivered the flowers. He said, "Do not say anything because they can take action against you." And I want to put this in the record because, you know, they are so powerful that they can make my job disappear or, for that matter, something go wrong. So, I mean, I'm beginning to be in this, I'm afraid. I'm a grown-up man. But, you know, I just want you to be afraid for these people because we are always the little people to them. And that's the difference between them and myself. So I just want to say that I want to cooperate with everything. But, you know, I hope this doesn't transpire for me.

Because first of all, let me just alleviate your fears. You are not a suspect. I am not looking to put any charges on you whatsoever. Okay. At this point, you're just a witness to me. And that's why we're just. That's why I just wanted to speak to you, okay? You're not a suspect. You're not upset. You're not in any trouble. Okay. Um, as far as Mr. Epstein being powerful, he's just a man. He puts on his pants just like you and me. Okay. The fact that his checkbook is a little fatter than ours, that's how it goes. But that doesn't mean that he's above the law, okay? And that's the extent of it. Uh, he's not a brain surgeon, as he told people. He's a money man. That's it. He takes money and invests money, and he makes money doing it. That's it. That's the extent of it. That's the extent of this man. All right. So you shouldn't fear him. Um, that's basically it. He's just. He's just a man, just like you and me.

Yeah. I hope he doesn't take care of, um, actions against me. Because, you know, I can give you some names. All this. I have the books that I used to sit for all his properties and very important people in Washington. But in this book is that he prefers and each time he does it so you can contact these people.

I'd be very interested in. I'm going to give you my card. Um, I left one on your door when I went down there. Yes, I saw that.

But my wife got scared when he said, well, something happened.

And I tried to explain to your wife, you know, and I told her the same thing. You're not in any trouble whatsoever. I just did want to talk to you. Um. Do you feel that you have to call the investigator? Did they tell you? You have to call them.

She told me if you please call me back, you know. But you know, now that we spoke and I have all these fears that I thought I knew, I didn't know I wasn't, I wasn't sure exactly of the investigation, sir. So I don't think we have to call him, sir.

You don't have to call him. You're under no obligation to call him. Okay. Um, you don't have to speak to them. If they come knocking on your door, you can just say, look, I don't want to speak to you. Get off my property and call me if you like. Call me and I'll tell them. Hey, he doesn't want to speak to you. That's it. Um. I just don't want you to feel that. That you have to call him.

Um, obviously, what we discuss stays between us. Um, I'd like to take a look at that book [Ed note: Epstein's Black Book]. Um, I'd be willing to drive down to Miami, take a look at it, and give it right back to you. Um.

I used to keep the receipts from these rental companies, but you know, sometimes I throw them away, but I'm pretty sure they have it there because I might have left.

Right.

And, uh. And also my signature on the checks at London airport, the plane, and the store that I went to.

And what other stores did you go to? I mean, were they with you when you went to the store?

Usually, you will go drive around because you will stay in the car. He is the person that can like to be seen. So he will send somebody what you like and then tell Alfredo to buy it for you. I was born in Europe in Needle, um, and all the famous shopping, uh. What is it?

Okay. Did you have to buy them, um, negligees or undergarments?

No, no, I think I will buy something like that.

That is what I would buy. Stuff like that. Okay. Um, jewellery.

And. No, I won't, well, you know, iPods and something like that. You know that when people had computers, um, I think.

The girl you brought the flowers for, was it the same girl that you rented the car for?

Yes.

Okay.

All right. Um. You have my card. Let me. Actually, you know what? I'm going to give you my cell phone as well, okay? It's on 24/7, and. Um, that's my cell phone. It's on 24 hours a day. And call me anytime you want. Um. At this time, I'm going to go ahead and conclude the statement and find out my watch is. Hold on. I have one 118 1:18 p.m.
