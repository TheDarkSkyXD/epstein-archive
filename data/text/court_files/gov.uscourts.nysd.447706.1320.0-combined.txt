to turn massages into sex (that was his modus operandi and plan all along); and that Maxwell
recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position, such as therapeutic masseuse, with
knowledge that the intent was for that person would be pressured to provide sexual gratification
to Epstein. As a result, Epstein's use of massages for sexual purposes is a central part of this
case.
And Defendant's role in those massages - and knowledge of the purposes of those
massages - is a critical piece of evidence showing her state of mind when she attacked Ms.
Giuffre's assertions as "entirely untrue." Ms. Giuffre intends to prove at trial that Defendant
knew full well the sexual purpose for which she was recruiting females - including underage
females like Ms. Giuffre. Ms. Giuffre is entitled to explore Defendant's knowledge of the sexual
activities that took place under the guise of "massages." Otherwise Defendant will be able to
portray to the jury an inaccurate picture of that what was happening at Epstein's house what
nothing more than run-of-the-mill massage therapy. See, e.g., McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 7, Tr.
of Maxwell Depo. (Apr. 22, 2016) at 51 ("Q: Did [the pay for massage therapists] vary on what
sexual acts they performed? ... A: No, it varied depending on how much time, some massage
therapists charge more and some charge less.").
Defendant's refusal to answer questions about alleged "adult" consensual sex also blocks
Ms. Giuffre from seeking legitimate discovery in this case. By refusing to answer questions
about her and Epstein's sexual activities with alleged "adults," Defendant is essentially given the
ability to refuse to answer any sexual question she does not wish to answer. Defendant simply
has to deem the question as involving "consensual adult sex" and no need be given. The result is
to leave Ms. Giuffre with no way of exploring the identity of these alleged adults, the ages of
these alleged adults, and indeed whether they were adults at all. This allows Defendant to claim


that she is unaware of any sexual activity involving underage females, because (she claims) the
only sexual activity she was aware involved adults.
The Court should compel Ms. Maxwell to answer all questions about her knowledge
relating to sexual activities with Epstein and other females while at Epstein's various homes. See
Fed. R. Crim. P. 37(a)(3)(B)(i); see, e.g, Kelly v. Al Tech, No. 09 CIV. 962 LAK MHD, 2010
WL 1541585, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 2010) ("Under the Federal Rules, when a party refuses
to answer a question during a deposition, the questioning party may subsequently move to
compel disclosure of the testimony that it sought. The court must determine the propriety of the
deponent's objection to answering the questions, and can order the deponent to provide
improperly withheld answers during a continued deposition" (internal citations omitted)). Of
course, the party objecting to discovery must carry the burden of proving the validity of its
objections, particularly in light of "the broad and liberal construction afforded the federal
discovery rules...." John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Book Dog Books, LLC, 298 F.R.D. 184, 186
(S.D.N.Y. 2014). For purposes of a deposition, the information sought "need not be admissible
at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence." Chen-Oster v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 293 F.R.D. 557, 561 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing
Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1)).
Defendant cannot carry her burden of showing that the questions asked are not
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. This is a case in which
sexual activities lie at the heart of the issues in dispute. As a result, it is hardly surprising to find
that discovery pertains to alleged "adult" sexual activities - and questions about such subjects are
entirely proper. See, e.g., Condit v. Dunne, 225 F.R.D. 100, 113 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (in defamation
case, "Plaintiff is hereby ordered to answer questions regarding his sexual relationships in so far

During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months.
He was referred by
associates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.
Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests.
Rodriguez advised he had
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein.
If Rodriguez needed to relay a
message to Mr. Epstein,
he would have to notify Epstein's secretary
"Leslie" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal
assistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein.
Rodriguez
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in
residence.
I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in
Palm Beach.
Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked
specifically about masseuses coming to the house.
Rodriguez stated he
would have two massages a day.
Epstein would have one massage in the
morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them
comfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them.
Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them
entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.
They would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein.
would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if
any of the masseuses appeared young in age.
He advised he didn't ask
their ages but felt they were very young.
Rodriguez stated they ate
like his own daughter who is in high school.
Rodriguez stated they
would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time.

He knew the girls were still in high

felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.
He would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and
would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor.
He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put
them away in an armoire.
He described the armoire as a small wood
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.
Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive
her self to Epstein's house without incident.
Rodriguez said the girl
always needed rides to and from the house.
Rodriguez referred himseli
as a "human ATM machine" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a
minimum balance of $2, 000 dollars on him at all times.
When a girl
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either
not in residence or
was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to

cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,
marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt.
I also located several media related items within Room B, which were
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence
Custodians,
I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a
white in color CPU marked Premio.
The Premio CPU was in a computer
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on.
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen.
I removed
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other
media.
The Prenio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours,
I assisted
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way,
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed
by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media
related material from the residence.
Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the
left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or
features indicating a make or model.
This CPU was powered off with
the power cord not plugged in.
The keyboard and mouse were atop the
It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,
printer, or other media device.
On the back Panel of the CPU, I
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk.
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search
and no external camera was located within this room.
The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel
LCD screen.
The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,
i e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc.
This type of media is
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media
was found.
After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis
via a property receipt.
I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west.
The desk held a
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and
printer; however, no CPU was located.
All of the cables were removed
from an area where a computer had once been.
A search of the desk
area revealed no signs of any media devices.
Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of
the pool.
In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office
type setting, with an I-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been.
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.

called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against
Jeffrey Epstein.
Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's

Initially I was assigned to enter the residence and conduct a
sweep of the premises for safety purposes.
I then accompanied CSEU

this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house
with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.
we began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a
Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage.
Nothing of evidentiary value was located.
We then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east
side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets.
Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained.
A small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath
area I located a phone message book with recent messages.
This item
was
seized as evidence.
Please note this bath and shower area are not
as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items
to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items.
then searched a bath area and closet at the base of the main

We then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner
of the property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as
evidence.
I was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was
Douglas Schoettle.
Mr.
Schoettle was in the residence at the
beginning of the
search warrant. He was present during the warrant
service and subseguent search.
I stood by with him until the search
was completed and I departed

this. Because I went through - the first
time I went to the deposition I was in Palm
Beach and I did my duty, I mean, I tell what
I know, but now I know there is more
digging, all I want is this to be to get on
with my normal life and stuff.
Q. So when you come here today to testify,
your main objective is to get back to your normal.
life and get out of the spotlight of this case.
Q. And in doing so have you held back some
of the details that you know about that happened
in this case to remove yourself from the
spotlight?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: No, sir.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Okay. Have you ever talked to Ghislaine
Maxwell after that telephone call where she called
you and you felt threatened?
A. No.
Q. Okay. So going back to where we started
here was, does Ghislaine Maxwell have knowledge of
Page 177
the girls that would come over to Jeffrey
Epstein's house that are in roughly the same age
group as C. and T. and to have a good time as you
put it?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. And what was her involvement and/or
knowledge about that?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: She knew what was going on.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. You referred to her at one point in time
as Jeffrey Epstein's companion. But then later on
you said that if she flew she flew on a different
airplane and oftentimes or sometimes she slept in
a different bed from Mr. Epstein. Did that seem
unusual to you?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: It was odd but, I mean, and
again, everything is odd in Palm Beach.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Okay, I don't mean to laugh.
Mr. Epstein fly to Jet Aviation, she fly
to Galaxy Aviation, but they never flew the same

written down anywhere?
Q. It's my understanding that C. and T.
either came to his house alone to visit with Mr.
Epstein or brought other girls in their age group
Were you familiar with that type of
recruitment process of girls bringing other girls?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
Q. Can you tell me more about what you know
about girls bringing other girls that are
relatively the same age to come to Jeffrey
Epstein's house and to use your words, have a good
time?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: It's hard to know who they
knew. But I think that was -- they feel
better themselves when they're in a group
than going by themselves, but I don't know
somebody recruiting.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Okay. And you've talked about, at least
referred to yourself I believe to the police and
Page 167
as well today as a human ATM machine. Right?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Something like that. I was
supposed to carry cash at all times.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. One of the primary reasons why you
carried cash was to pay the girls in this age
group of C. and T. for whatever happened at the
house. Right?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
That's a fair statement. Right?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Okay. And when C., let's use her for
example, would bring somebody else to the house,
did you pay C. as well as whomever she brought to
the house, pay them both?
A. No, I pay only one person.
Q. Okay. My understanding, and tell me if
this is wrong or you can corroborate this, is that
Mr. Epstein would pay the girl that was actually
performing whatever was happening in the room --

anybody who brought that person over to the house,
they would both get paid cash. Are you familiar
with that?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. If C. brought another girl over to the
house and C. stayed downstairs but this other gir
went upstairs with Mr. Epstein, which one would
you pay?
A. I don't know because I was told who to
Q. And Sarah Kellen always told you?
A. Sarah told me pay so and so.
Q. So if we were going to ask anybody else
about the exact method in terms of who would get
paid and for what, who would the people be? I
mean, other than Mr. Epstein who else could we ask
these questions?
Q. Sarah Kellen?
She would know this?
Page 169
Q. What about Ghislaine Maxwell?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: You're talking about the
boss. I don't know.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. To your knowledge was Ghislaine Maxwell
aware of these girls that are in the age group of
C. and T. coming to Jeffrey Epstein's house to
have a good time?
MR. CRITTON: Form.

Mrs. Maxwell called me and told me not to
ever discuss or contact her again in a

get a job.
Q. Who was that person?
A.
I contact Jean-Luc and I contact Eva, the
Swedish girl, she used to be very good friends
with Mr. Epstein because she asked me she need
somebody in New York.
Q. What does Eva do?

Q. Okay. Other than you will be sorry if
you contact any of my friends again did she say
anything else about what you know about Mr.
Epstein and/or what goes on at his house?
She said something like don't open your
mouth or something like that. But you have to
understand, I'm a civil humble, I came as an
immigrant to service people, and right now you
feel a little - I'm 55 and I'm afraid. First of

This is the way they treat you, better do this and
you shut up and don't talk to nobody and -

who specifically are you talking about when you
say the word they?

Yet during her deposition, Defendant refused to answer any questions that she construed
as having something to do with "consensual adult sex." Defense counsel supported that position
that "frankly, [that's] none of your business and I instruct the witness not to answer." See
Declaration of Sigrid S. McCawley ("McCawley Deel.") at Exhibit 1, Tr. of Maxwell Depo.
(Apr. 22, 2016) at 21. The result was that at a number of points throughout her deposition,
Defendant refused to answer questions about subjects integral to this lawsuit, including questions
about what the alleged "massage therapists" were doing at Jeffrey Epstein's house and the sexual
nature of those massages.
For example, Defendant refused to answer questions about whether she had given Jeffrey
Epstein a massage:
Q. Have you ever given Jeffrey Epstein a massage?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form, foundation, And I'm going to
instruct you not to answer that question. I don't have any problem with you
asking questions about what the subject matter of this lawsuit is, which would
be, as you've termed it, sexual trafficking of Ms. Roberts.
To the extent you are asking for information relating to any consensual
adult interaction between my client and Mr. Epstein, I'm going to instruct her not
to answer because it's not part of this litigation and it is her private confidential
information, not subject to this deposition.
MS. McCAWLEY: You can instruct her not to answer. That is your
right. But I will bring her back for another deposition because it is part of the
subject matter of this litigation so she should be answering these questions. This
is civil litigation, deposition and she should be responsible for answering these
questions.
MR. PAGLIUCA: I disagree and you anderstand the bounds that I put on
it.
MS. McCAWLEY: No, I don't. I will continue to ask my questions and
you can continue to make your objections.
Q. Did you ever participate from the time period of 1992 to 2009, did
you ever participate in a massage with Jeffrey Epstein and another female?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection. Do not answer that question. Again, to the
extent you are asking for some sort of illegal activity as you've construed in

Here again, this information is critical to the case. Among other things, these questions
are designed to show a modus operant ("M.O") for Epstein and Maxwell - specifically, how they
recruited for a non-sexual massage than converted the massage into sexual activities.
One last illustration comes from Defendant's refusal to answer about her knowledge of
Epstein's sexual interests during massages:
Q.
Does Jeffrey like to have his nipples pinched during sexual
encounters?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form and foundation.
A. I'm not referring to any advice on my counsel. I'm not talking about
any adult sexual things when I was with him.
Q. When Jeffrey would have a massage, would he request that the
masseuse pinch his nipples while he was having a massage?
A. I'm not talking about anything with consensual adult situation.
See McCawley Deel. at Exhibit 5, Tr. of Maxwell Depo. (Apr. 22, 2016) at 82.
While Epstein himself might also provide answers to these questions, it appears likely
that he will assert his Fifth Amendment privilege regarding his sexual activities. Accordingly,
Ms. Giuffre must pursue questioning of Maxwell to obtain information on this subject. Here
again, information about Epstein's sexual idiosyncrasies will provide important corroboration to
Ms. Giuffre's testimony that she had sexual interactions of an identical nature with Epstein.
These refusals are not an isolated instance. Instead, similar refusals to answer questions
occurred repeatedly throughout the deposition. See, e.g., MeCawley Decl. at Composite Exhibit
6. 52-55; 64-65; 82; 92-93; 137-38; 307-09.
The Court should compel Defendant to answer all these questions. In addition to the
specific points made above, the "big picture" here reveals how vital such discovery is. At the
core of Ms. Giuffre's allegations is the allegation that Defendant lured her into a sexual situation
with the offer of a job making money as a massage therapist; that Epstein always habitually tried

I wouldn't say that they were untrue. I
would just say that she printed them as journalists
take your words and turn them into something else.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) She got it wrong?
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
Mischaracterization.
A
In some ways, yes.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Did she print things
in her articles that you did not say to her?
MR. EDWARDS: I object and ask that the
witness be given the opportunity to see the document
so that she can review it and answer that question
accurately. Otherwise she's unable to answer the
question. I'm not going to allow her to answer.
MS. MENNINGER: You know the civil rules
tell you not to suggest answers to your client.

your lawyer is now directing you to not all of a
sudden remember what your answer is. That's what
he's suggesting that you say. So you're not supposed

public -- we didn't think it was going to be this
publicly announced and that big. So we turned off
the news and we stopped reading so many things.
You didn't read the articles about your
stories to Sharon Churcher --
A
I've read some articles --
Let me just finish. You did not read the
articles published by Sharon Churcher about your
stories to Sharon Churcher?
I have read some articles about what
Sharon Churcher wrote. And a lot of the stuff that
she writes she takes things from my own mouth and
changes them into her own words as journalists do.
And I never came back to her and told her
to correct anything. What was done was done. There
was nothing else I can do.
So even if she printed something that were
untrue you didn't ask her to correct it, correct?
A
There was things that she printed that
really pissed me off, but there was nothing I could
do about it. It's already out there.
She printed things that were untrue,
correct?

Mischaracterization.

connection with this case I don't have any problem with you asking that question.
To the extent these questions involve consensual acts between adults, frankly,
they're none of your business and I will instruct the witness not to answer
MS. McCAWLEY: This case involves sexual trafficking, sexual abuse,
questions about her having interactions with other females is relevant to this case.
She needs to answer these questions.
MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm instructing her not to answer.
MS. McCAWLEY: Then we will be back here again.
See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2, Tr. of Maxwell Depo. (Apr. 22, 2016) at 19-22 (emphasis
added).
Defendant's participation in massages with Epstein is a central part of this case. Ms.
Giuffre has explained that during her first sexual encounter with Jeffrey Epstein, it was
Defendant who provided instruction on how to do it and how to turn the massage into a sexual
event. Obviously, proof that Defendant had previously massaged Epstein - include massages
with sexual component - would provide important corroboration for Ms. Giuffre's testimony at
trial. And proof that Defendant was involved in massages will further help prove that
statements to the press that Virginia's allegations were obvious lies" was itself an obvious lie.
As another example, Defendant refused to answer questions about her knowledge that
Johanna Sjoberg was hired to work for Epstein and provided massages. In the police report,
Johanna admitted that Maxwell recruited her to work for Epstein. See McCawley Decl, at
Exhibit 3, Giufffre000076-77 (police report indicating that Johanna was recruited by Maxwell).
Yet during Defendant's deposition, she refused to answer questions regarding Johanna Sjoberg.
Q. Do you know what tasks Johanna was hired to performance?
A. She was tasked to answer telephones.
Q. Did you ever ask her to rub Jeffrey's feet?...
A. I believe that I have read that, but I don't have any memory of it.

flying on a helicopter with Ghislaine Maxwell?
A I believe that it was taken out of
context. Ghislaine told me that she flew Bill
Clinton in. And Ghislaine likes to talk a lot of
stuff that sounds fantastical. And whether it's true
or not, that is what I do recall telling Sharon
Churcher.
So you told Sharon Churcher that Ghislaine
Maxwell is the one who told you that she flew Bill
Clinton in the helicopter?
I told Sharon Churcher that Ghislaine flew
Bill Clinton onto the island, based upon what
Ghislaine had told me.
Q
Not based upon what Bill Clinton had told
you, correct?
A
Correct.
Did you ever ask Sharon Churcher to
correct anything that was printed under her name,
concerning your stories to Sharon Churcher?
A
I wasn't given those stories to read
before they were printed.
After they were printed did you read them?
A
I tried to stay away from them. They were
very hard. You have to understand it was a very hard
time for me and my husband to have to have this

So that's a different piece of paper?
A
Yeah, that's just random paper.
So you had a green spiral notebook that
you began sometime in 2011 or 2012 in which you wrote
down your recollections about what had happened to
you, and you burned that in a bonfire in 2013.
Did I get that right?
A
You got that right.
And do you have no other names of people
to whom you claim Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to

Single sheets.
And did you write a long document or a
short document? What was it?
A
I can't recall how long the document was,
but I would say it would be a few pages.
And other than asking you to write
whatever you remember about Prince Andrew, did she
give you any other directions about what you should
write?
A
She was interested in two things, really.
How Epstein got away with so many counts of child
trafficking for sex and how Prince Andrew was
involved in it. Those were her two main inquiries.
What did she ask you to write?
She asked me to write about Prince Andrew.

Q

those documents after you received discovery requests
from us in this case?

I haven't been able to obtain those boxes.
I can't get them sent back up to me. It's going to

afford to get them up.

*3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 1997) ("While discovery is not unlimited and may not unnecessarily
intrude into private matters, in the instant case inquiry into private matters is clearly relevant to
the subject matter of the suit. Accordingly, plaintiff Misty Weber shall respond to defendants'
interrogatories concerning her sexual partners....*).
Generally speaking, instructions from attorneys to their clients not to answer questions at
a deposition should be "limited to [issues regarding] privilege." Morales v. Zondo, Inc., 204
F.R.D. 50, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). In this case. defense counsel ranged far beyond the normal
parameters of objections and sought to decide for himself what issues were relevant. That was
improper and the Court should order a resumption of the Defendant's deposition so that she can
answer questions about her knowledge of sexual activity relating to Jeffrey Epstein.
CONCLUSION
Defendant should be ordered to sit for a follow-up deposition and directed to answer
questions regarding her knowledge of alleged "adult" sexual activity.

Q. Did you ever tell Johanna that she would get extra money if she
provided Jeffrey massages?
A. I was always happy to give career advice to people and I think that
becoming somebody in the healthcare profession. either exercise instructor or
nutritionist or professional massage therapist is an excellent job opportunity.
Hourly wages are around 7, 8, $9 and as a professional healthcare provider you
can earn somewhere between as we have established 100 to $200 and to be able to
travel and have a job that pays that is a wonderful job opportunity. So in the
context of advising people for opportunities for work, it is possible that I would
have said that she should explore that as an option.
Q. Did you tell her she would get extra money if she massaged Jeffrey?
A. I'm just saying, 1 cannot recall the exact conversation. I give career
advice and I have done that.
Q. Did you ever have Johanna massage you?
A. I did.
Q. How many times?
A. I don't recall how many times.
Q. Was there sex involved?
A. No. ...
Q. Did you ever have sexual contact with Johanna?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form and foundation. You need to give
me an opportunity to get in between the questions.
Anything that involves consensual sex on your part, I'm instructing you
not 1o answer.
Q. Did you ever have sexual contact with Johanna?
A. [MR. PAGLIUCA?] Again, she is an adult --
Q. I'm asking you, did you ever have sexual contact with Johanna?
A. I've just been instructed not to answer.
Q. On what basis?
A. You have to ask my lawyer.

What did you get paid for, if not for
those pieces of paper?
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
A
I was paid for the picture with Prince
Andrew with his arm around me, Ghislaine in the
background. And I was paid for the, I guess, the
print of the stories.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Anything else?
A
No.
You were not paid for those pieces of
paper?
A
No.
All right. And how many pieces of paper
did you write?
A
Like I said, I'm rounding it around three.
Three pieces of paper?
That's what I -- I don't remember to be
exact on a number. I'm sorry. But over three pages.
And you wrote those sometime in 2011?
A
The week that she was coming out to see
me.
Q
A
A
And you gave them to her, right?
I gave them to her.
Did you keep a copy of that?

My little yellow Kodak camera.
Who took the picture?
Jeffrey Epstein.
And where did you have it developed?
I believe when I got back to America.
So where?
I don't know.
Palm Beach?
I don't know.
What is the date the photograph was
printed?
A
I believe it's in March 2001.
Okay.
A
But that's just off of my photographic
memory. I don't - it could be different, but I
think it's March 2001.
You have a photographic memory?
A
I'm not saying I have a photographic
memory. But if I'd look at the back of the photo and
I remember what it says, I believe it was March 2001.
Q
Did the photograph ever leave your
possession for a while?
A
I gave it to the FBI.
Okay. And when did you get it back?
A
When they took copies of it.

I am out of my depth to understanding defamation and other legal hazards and don't want to end up in a law
suit aimed at me from anyone if 1 can help it. Apparently even saying Virginia is a lier has hazard! I have never
been in a suit criminal or civil and want it to stay that way.
The US lawyers for the Jane Does are filling additional discovery motions and if I speak | open my self to being
part of discovery apparently. I am trying to stay out of litigation and not have to employ lawyers for years as i
get lost in US legal nightmare. I stand no legal risk currently on these old charges and civil suits against Jeffrey
We need to consult with US lawyers on any statement / make and the complaints too
Perhaps we make a statement of the legal risk of saying anything for potential defamation or something that
prevents a full and frank detailed rebuttal + the press not being the place for that? Regardless, Philip plse call
jeffrey lawyer and see what you can understand from him and pehaps craft something in conjunction with
him? Either way I think you need to speak to him to understand my risk so you can help me understand it - too
may cooks in the kitchen and I can't make good decisions. Pise reach out to him today
+ I have already suffered such a terrible and painful loss over the last few days that i can't even see what life
after press he'll even looks like - statements that don't address all just lead to more questions.. what is my
relationship to clinton ? Andrew on and on.

Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff,
Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
V.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT
TO ANSWER DEPOSITION QUESTIONS FILED UNDER SEAL!
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files this
Motion to Compel Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions. During her recent deposition,
Defendant refused to answer numerous questions about allegedly "adult" sexual activity related
to Jeffrey Epstein. Because this activity is highly relevant to this case, Defendant should be
ordered to answer questions about it.
As the Court is aware, this defamation case involves Ms. Giuffre's assertions that she and
other females were recruited by Defendant to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein under the
guise of being "massage therapists." See Complaint. (DE 1). at 127 (Giuffre "described
Maxwell's role as one of the main women who Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for
sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his sexual abuse and sex
trafficking scheme"). In response to these assertions, Defendant has made the sweeping claim
that Ms. Giuffre's assertions are "entirely false" and "entirely untrue." Complaint, DE 1, at 1 31.
' Defendant has labelled her entire deposition transcript as Confidential at this time. Counsel for
the parties conferred at the deposition regarding answering questions.
