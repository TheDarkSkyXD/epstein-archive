Reuters reports .BY THE NUMBERS

Today's lone government economic report comes at 8:30 a.m. ET, when the Labor Department issues its weekly look at initial jobless claims. Economists are expecting 240,000 new claims for the week ended Feb. 18, barely changed from the prior week's 239,000.There are two Fed-related events Thursday, with speeches from Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan. Kaplan is a voting member of the FOMC, while Lockhart is retiring at month's end and will focus his speech on his 10-year tenure.Earnings reports out this morning include the latest quarterly numbers from Apache (APA), Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Hormel (HRL), Kohl's (KSS), LendingTree (TREE), Sanderson Farms (SAFM), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Visteon (VC) and Wayfair (W).After-the-bell reports Thursday
 will come from Baidu (BIDU), Brocade (BRCD), Gap (GPS), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intuit (INTU), Nordstrom (JWN) and Splunk (SPLK).STOCKS TO WATCH

HP Inc. (HPQ) is among our stocks to watch, reporting adjusted quarterly profit of 38 cents per share, 1 cent above estimates, while the computer hardware maker's revenue also beat forecasts. HP's results were helped by a rebound in the personal computer business, with sales rising for a second straight quarter.Tesla (TSLA) reported a wider-than-expected loss of 69 cents per share, compared with the consensus estimate for a 43 cent loss. But the automaker's revenue beat forecasts, and it said its new Model 3 sedan was on track for volume production by September. Separately, Tesla announced that CFO Jason Wheeler will leave the company in April, to be succeeded by former CFO Deepak Ahuja.Square (SQ) lost 4 cents per share for its latest quarter, smaller than the 9 cents forecast by
 analysts, while the mobile payments company's revenue came in slightly above estimates. Square saw a better than 34 percent jump in payment volume compared with a year earlier.Fitbit (FIT) reported a quarterly loss of 56 cents per share, 6 cents wider than expected, while the wearable fitness device maker's revenue fell short of estimates. The company's bottom line was hurt by weaker-than-expected holiday sales of its latest fitness trackers. It was Fitbit's first quarterly loss since going public in June 2015.Jack In The Box (JACK) missed estimates by 7 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.18 per share, and the restaurant chain's revenue fell short of forecasts as well. The results were impacted by lower-than-expected sales at the company's Qdoba Mexican Grill chain, and Jack In
 The Box cut its full-year earnings forecast.Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 67 cents per share, while the restaurant chain's revenue beat Street forecasts and comparable restaurant sales rose 1.1 percent.L Brands (LB) beat estimates by 13 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.03 per share. However, the Victoria's Secret parent saw revenue miss estimates, and it also gave weaker-than-expected guidance for the full year on slowing demand at its biggest brand.Barclays (BCS) reported an unexpected rise in its core capital ratio, with that key metric climbing to 12.4 percent compared with expectations for 11.8 percent. The bank set aside more money to cover possible costs of legal issues and global market conditions.Wells Fargo (WFC) may be
 hit up for legal costs by Prudential Financial (PRU), according to an SEC filing by the insurance company. The dispute centers around whether Wells Fargo retail bankers improperly sold Prudential's insurance.Boston Beer (SAM) gave a weaker-than-expected full-year forecast, and said it was disappointed with weak depletion rates. Those rates measure the speed at which beer is delivered from distributors to retail stores.
