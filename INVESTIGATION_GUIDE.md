# Investigation System Guide

## Overview

The **Investigation System** is the core collaborative workspace of the Epstein Archive. It allows researchers to move from passive viewing to active analysis by organizing entities, documents, and other evidence into coherent cases.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  Navigate to **"Investigations"** in the main menu.
2.  Click **"New Investigation"**.
3.  Enter a **Title** and a **Hypothesis** (what you are trying to prove).
4.  Browse the archive. When you find relevant items (Person, Document, Flight), click the **"Add to Investigation"** button.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built around a central Context Provider that manages state and API sync.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. The Workspace (`InvestigationWorkspace.tsx`)

The main container. It manages the layout and switches between views (Board, Timeline, Graph). It listens for global events like `investigation-item-added`.

### 2. Evidence Panel (`InvestigationEvidencePanel.tsx`)

Located on the right. It lists all items "pinned" to the investigation.

- **Function**: Draggable source for the board.
- **Features**: Filtering by type (Entity, Document, Media), relevance scoring.

### 3. Infinite Board (`InvestigationBoard.tsx`)

A 2D canvas where researchers can spatially organize evidence.

- **Nodes**: Cards representing entities/docs.
- **Edges**: User-created connections between nodes.

### 4. Forensic Tools (`ForensicAnalysisWorkspace.tsx`)

Advanced tools for deep diving into specific documents. Allows annotation and OCR verification within the investigation context.

## 🔄 Data Flow

1.  **Selection**: User finds an item (e.g., "Ghislaine Maxwell" entity card).
2.  **Dispatch**: `addToInvestigation(id, item, relevance)` is called via Context.
3.  **Persist**: Item is saved to DB via API (`POST /api/investigations/:id/evidence`).
4.  **Broadcast**: `CustomEvent('investigation-item-added')` triggers UI updates.
5.  **Visualization**: Item appears in the Evidence Panel, ready to be placed on the Board.

## 🛠️ Extending the System

To add a new tool to the investigation workspace:

1.  Create your component in `src/components/investigation/`.
2.  Register it in the tab switcher in `InvestigationWorkspace.tsx`.
3.  Use `useInvestigations()` hook to access current case data.
