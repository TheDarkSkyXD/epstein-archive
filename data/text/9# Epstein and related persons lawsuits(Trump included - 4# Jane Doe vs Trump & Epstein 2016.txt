under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. 
4, Defendants are citizens of the State of New York for purposes of diversity 


jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 2 of 9 


a This Court has original subject matter jurisdiction with respect to this action 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 as there exists complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff 
and Defendants and the amount in controversy exceeds Seventy Five Thousand Dollars 
($75,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs. 

6. Defendants are each subject to the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1332 with proper venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 as both defendants are residents of 
and/or are domiciled in this district and the events giving rise to the claims occurred in this 


district. 


RAPE, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, CRIMINAL SEXUAL ACTS, SEXUAL ABUSE, 
FORCIBLE TOUCHING, ASSAULT, BATTERY, INTENTIONAL AND RECKLESS 
INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, DURESS, AND FALSE 
IMPRISONMENT 

7. Plaintiff was subject to acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts, 
sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of emotional 
distress, duress, false imprisonment, and threats of death and/or serious bodily injury by the 
Defendants that took place at several parties during the summer months of 1994. The parties 
were held by Defendant Epstein at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant 
Epstein at 9 E. 71st St. in Manhattan. During this period, Plaintiff was a minor of age 13 and 
was legally incapable under New York law of consenting to sexual intercourse and the other 
sexual contacts detailed herein. NY Penal L § 130.05(3)(a). The rapes in the first, second, and 
third degrees; sexual misconduct; criminal sexual acts in the first, second, and third degrees; 


sexual abuse in the first, second, and third degrees; and forcible touching (and, on information 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 3 of 9 


and belief, predatory sexual assault) detailed herein are unlawful under New York law, e.g., NY 
Penal L § 130.20-130.52, and 130.55-130.65 (and, on information and belief, 130.95) and 
constitute the torts of, inter alia, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional or reckless 
infliction of emotional distress, including threats of force and serious bodily harm, under New 
York law. Declaration of Plaintiff Jane Doe, Exhibit A hereto; Declaration of Tiffany Doe, 
Exhibit B hereto. Jane Doe and Tiffany Doe are each pseudonyms as each woman wishes 
anonymity. Tiffany Doe, a witness, was an employee of Defendant Epstein. Exh. B. 

8. Courts have discretion to allow proceeding anonymously where the need for 
privacy outweighs the public’s interest in knowing their identity and any prejudice to the 
defendants. Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). This 
litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and identification of 
Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others. Exh. A. All of the 
ten factors that the Second Circuit articulated as relevant to this analysis favor anonymity, 
especially factors 1-4, 7, and 10 (e.g., factors one and two: “whether the litigation involves 


66> 


matters that are ‘highly sensitive and [of a] personal nature,’” and “whether identification poses 


a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the ... party [seeking to proceed anonymously] or 


999 


even more critically, to innocent non-parties’”’.), or are neutral with respect to anonymity. 
Protecting Plaintiff's anonymity is also appropriate as she is a rape victim. 

2. Plaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a 
series of parties, with other similarly situated minor females, held at a New York City residence 


that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. At least four of the parties were attended by 


Defendant Trump. Exhs. A and B. On information and belief, by this time in 1994, Defendant 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 4 of 9 


Trump had known Defendant Epstein for seven years (New York, 10/28/02), and knew that 
Plaintiff was then just 13 years old. Exhs. A and B. 

10. Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties. 
On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff 
to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the 
course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but 
with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiffs pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in 
the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A and 
B. 

11. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened Plaintiff that, were 
she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse of her by Defendant Trump, 
Plaintiff and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. Exhs. A and B. 

2. Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with Plaintiff at two of the parties. The 
second sexual encounter with Defendant Epstein took place after Plaintiff had been raped by 
Defendant Trump. Defendant Epstein forced himself upon Plaintiff and proceeded to rape her 
anally and vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike 
Plaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff that he, 
Defendant Epstein, rather than Defendant Trump, should have been the one who took Plaintiff's 
virginity, before Plaintiff finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein. Exhs. A and 
B. 

13, The threats of violence against Plaintiff and her family continued, this time from 


Defendant Epstein, who again reiterated that Plaintiff was not to reveal any of the details of his 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 5 of 9 


sexual and physical abuse of her or else, specifically, Plaintiff and her family would be seriously 
physically harmed, if not killed. Exhs. A and B. 

14. While still under threats of physical harm by coming forward and having no 
reason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted, Plaintiff, who has 
suffered from stress, emotional distress, mental pain and suffering, among other problems, ever 
since the assaults, was subjected to daily painful reminders of the horrific acts of one of the 
perpetrators, Defendant Trump, via mass media coverage of him starting on or about June 16, 
2015 that, over a short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable. Exh. A. 

13: As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by 
Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has suffered stress, emotional distress, and mental pain and 
suffering, as well as adverse physical consequences. 

16. As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by 
Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has suffered physical pain and suffering. 

17. As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by 
Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has been subjected to public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has 
suffered threats against her life and physical safety. 

18. As a direct and proximate result of the sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by 
Defendants upon her, Plaintiff has incurred special damages, including medical and legal 
expenses. 

19. The sexual assaults and rapes perpetrated by Defendants upon Plaintiff were 
intentional acts. 

20. The conduct of Defendants demonstrates willful, reckless and intentional conduct 


that raises a conscious indifference to consequences. 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 6 of 9 


21. At the appropriate time in this litigation, Plaintiff shall amend her complaint to 
assert a claim for punitive damages against Defendants in order to punish Defendants for their 


actions and to deter Defendants from repeating their conduct. 


TOLLING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS 

2d: Any statute of limitations applicable to rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual 
acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless infliction of 
emotional distress, false imprisonment of a minor, if any, is tolled owing to the continuous and 
active duress imposed upon Plaintiff by Defendants that effectively robbed Plaintiff of her free 
will to commence legal action until the present time. Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 722 
(2nd Cir.1987); Ross v. United States, 574 F. Supp. 536, 542 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). More 
particularly, Plaintiff was unrelentingly threatened by each Defendant that, were she ever to 
reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by Defendants, Plaintiff 
and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. The duress has not terminated and the 
fear has not subsided. The duress is an element of or inherent in the underlying causes of action 
complained of herein. The duress and coercion exerted by Defendants has been such as to have 
actually deprived Plaintiff of her freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time, and it rose to 
such a level that a person of reasonable firmness in Plaintiff's situation would have been unable 
to resist. Exhs. A and B. 

23. Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man 
and indicated that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, 
Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear 


like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 7 of 9 


Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was 
capable of having her whole family killed. Exhs. A and B. 

24. The duress had prevented Plaintiff from starting litigation before this year. 
However, as soon as she surfaced, she received threats. More specifically, shortly after her first 
complaint was filed in California on April 26, 2016, she started receiving threatening phone calls 
on her cell phone. Exh. A. 

20: Defendants are equitably estopped from arguing that any statute of limitations has 
not been tolled as Defendants wrongfully forced Plaintiff to refrain from timely commencing this 
action by threats, duress, and other misconduct. Exhs. A and B. 

26. Moreover, this action has been brought before the facts giving rise to the estoppel 
have ceased to be operational (i.e., while still under threats of physical harm by coming forward 
and having no reason to believe that the threats have ever been lifted or would ever be lifted) and 
since Plaintiff has decided to seek redress at this time, Plaintiff seeks an order of protection in 
favor of Plaintiff and all associated with her so as to protect them from harm and harassment 


from Defendants and their agents and associates. Exh. A. 


DEFAMATION 
27. On information and belief, on or about April 28, 2016, Defendant Trump 
provided the following statement to American Media, Inc. and/or Radar Online LLC for 
publication on at least their website RadarOnline.com regarding Plaintiff's complaint ED CV 16- 
797-DMG (KSx) filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California: 


“The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 8 of 9 


framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is 
absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” The statement provided for publication by 
Defendant Trump was published by said website and has been republished elsewhere in whole or 
in part numerous times (and similar statements of an attorney for Defendant Trump were also 
published). The statement provided for publication by Defendant Trump and that was published 
by said websites is false as it pertains to Plaintiff. 

28. The published statement is libelous on its face, and clearly exposes Plaintiff to 
hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy. 

29. AS a proximate result of the above-described publication, Plaintiff has suffered 
loss of her reputation, shame, mortification, and injury to her feelings, all to her damage in an 
amount to be established by proof at trial. 

30. The above-described publication was not privileged because it was published by 
Defendant Trump with malice, hatred and ill will toward Plaintiff and the desire to injure her. 

31: As a direct and proximate result of Defendant Trump’s defamation of Plaintiff, 


Plaintiff has been subjected to public scorn, hatred, and ridicule and has suffered other injury. 


PRAYER FOR RELIEF 


WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants and for the 
following relief: 
A. That judgment be entered against Defendants for special damages, compensatory 
damages, and punitive damages in an amount which shall be shown to be reasonable and just by 
the evidence and in excess of Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), exclusive of interests 


and costs; 


Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 9 of 9 


B. That all costs of this action be assessed against Defendants, including all 
reasonable attorney’s fees, costs and expenses of this action; 

{. That an order of protection in favor of Plaintiff and all associated with her be 
issued so as to protect them from harm and harassment from Defendants and their agents and 
associates; and 


D. Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. 


JURY DEMAND 


Plaintiff demands a trial by jury of all issues properly triable by jury in this action. 


Respectfully submitted,

ATTORNEY FOR PLAINTIFF 








Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 1 of 2 


DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 


|, Jane Doe, the Plaintiff in this matter proceeding under a pseudonym, state as follows: 


\ 


1. lam a competent adult over 18 years of age able to testify as to personal knowledge. The facts 
in this declaration are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and | am 
competent to testify to them if called upon to do so. 


2. | was subject to extreme sexual and physical abuse by the Defendants, including forcible rape, 
that took place at several parties of Defendant Epstein during the summer of 1994 in New York City at a 
residence used by Defendant Epstein. During this period, | was 13 years old. 


3. More particularly, | traveled by bus to New York City in June 1994 in the hope of starting a 
modeling career. | went to several modeling agencies but was told that | needed to put together a 
modeling portfolio before | would be considered. | then went to the Port Authority in New York City to 
start to make my way back home. There | met a woman who introduced herself to me as Tiffany. She 
told me about the parties and said that, if | would join her at the parties, | would be introduced to 
people who could get me into the modeling profession. Tiffany also told me | would be paid for 
attending. 


4. The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey 
Epstein. Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr. Epstein, including 
Defendant Donald Trump at four of the parties | attended. | understood that both Mr. Trump and Mr. 
Epstein knew that | was 13 years old. 


5. Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. 
On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed, 
exposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual 
attack, | loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to 
my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do 
whatever he wanted. 


6. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were | ever to reveal 
any of the details of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and | would be 
physically harmed if not killed. 


7. Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with me at two of the parties that summer. On the 
second occasion involving Defendant Epstein, Defendant Epstein forced himself upon me and proceeded 
to rape me anally and vaginally despite my Joud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to 
strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant 
Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump, before | finally 
managed to break away from Defendant Epstein. 





Case 1:16-cv-04642-RA Document 1-1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 2 of 2 


8. Immediately following this rape, just like Defendant Trump, Defendant Epstein threatened me 
not to ever reveal any of the details of Defendant Epstein’s sexual and physical abuse of me or else my 
family and | would be physically harmed if not killed. 


9. Both Defendants had Jet me know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated 
that they had the power, ability and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated 
that | shouldn’t ever say anything if | didn’t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was 
forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that | had not seen since that third 
incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed. 


10. The duress imposed on me by Defendants not to ever reveal any of the details of the sexual and 
physical abuse caused to me by Defendants has not terminated and the fear it has instilled in me has not 
subsided. Unfortunately, making matters worse for me, | was subjected to daily painful reminders of 
the horrific acts of Defendant Trump via mass media coverage of him starting last summer that, over a 
short period of time, became continuous and unavoidable. 


11. The duress had prevented me from starting litigation before this year. However, as soon as | 
surfaced, | received threats. More specifically, shortly after my first complaint was filed in California on 
April 26, 2016, ! started receiving threatening phone calls on a cell phone | then owned. The calls were 
never for more than 20 seconds or so before they hung up and they were always from a blocked or 
unavailable phone number according to my caller ID feature. Since | changed phone numbers, the 
threatening calls have completely stopped. 


12. This litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and | believe 
that identification of me would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to me and to others. 


13. | have no reason to believe that the Defendants’ threats have ever been lifted or will ever be 
lifted and so | request that the Court issue an order protecting me and my family from harm and 
harassment by the Defendants. 


| declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 
|, Tiffany Doe, a pseudonym, state as follows: 


1. {am a competent adult over 18 years of age able to'testify as to personal knowledge. The facts 
in this declaration are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and! am 


competent to testify to them if called upon to do so.

women to attend these parties, most of which were held at what is known as the Wexner Mansion 


located at 9 E. 71st St. in New York City. 


5. In June, 1994 while performing my duties as a recruiter of adolescent women to attend Mr. 
Epstein's parties, | met a 13-year-old adolescent woman, the Plaintiff in this matter, at the Port 
Authority in New York City who said that she had come to New York City in the hope of starting a

6. | persuaded the Plaintiff to attend a series of parties of Mr. Epstein that took place during the 
summer of 1994. | told her that, if she would join me at the parties, she would be introduced to people 


who could get her into the modeling profession and she would be paid for attending.

various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were

if she didn’t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her

15. After leaving the employment of Mr. Epstein in the year 2000, | was personally threatened by 
Mr. Epstein that | would be killed and my family killed as well if | ever disclosed any of the physical and 


sexual abuse of minor females that | had personally witnessed by Mr. Epstein or any of his guests. 


16. | am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that | 
personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein, including the 
Plaintiff, during the time of my employment from the years of 1990-2000 for Mr. Epstein. | swear to 
these facts under penalty of perjury even though | fully understand that the life of myself and my family 


is now in grave danger.
