ORDER ON PLAINTIFF JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S
MOTION TO COMPEL AND AMEND PROTECTIVE ORDER
THIS MATTER came before the Court on Plaintiff Jeffrey Epstein's Motion to Compel and
Amend Protective Order in the above-styled case. This Court having reviewed the Motion, having
heard argument of counsel, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:, The Motion seeks to Compel a Request to
Produce and to modify this Court's prior Protective Order in regard to specific requests of the Defendant
EDWARDS. In addition, the Motion seeks authority to direct a subpoena to the Bankruptcy Trustee of
the former law firm of the Defendants EDWARDS and ROTHSTEIN. The Court finds that the Amended
Request for Production and request for subpoena, does request documents which the Court finds are either
relevant and/or reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Therefore, within twenty (20) days
of the date of this Order, the Defendant EDWARDS shall produce any non-privileged documents as
identified in Paragraph 13 of EDWARDS' Motion to Compel and Amend Protective Order. In addition,
the Plaintiff EPSTEIN is given authority to issue a subpoena to the Bankruptcy Trustee requesting the
identical documents that are non-privileged.
Nothing in this Order shall constitute any waiver or ruling upon any privilege that may apply to
said documents and the Defendant EDWARDS and/or others may file an objection to any such
documentation on any privilege grounds and shall file a privilege log specifically identifying such
documents.

PLAINTIFF'S AMENDED MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES
AND FOR SANCTIONS
Plaintiff Jeffrey Epstein, by and through his undersigned counsel and pursuant to
Rule 1.380 of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby moves this Court to enter an
order compelling the Defendant Bradley Edwards, yet again, to provide responses to
Plaintiff's Request for Production. Plaintiff likewise requests that this Court order
sanctions against Defendant Edwards for his direct and flagrant disregard of this Court's
previous Order dated April 10, 2012. In support thereof, Plaintiff states:
INTRODUCTION
On March 9, 2012, Plaintiff Epstein served upon Defendant Edwards a Motion to
Compel and to Amend and Lift a Protective Order. A true and correct copy of Plaintiff's
Motion is attached hereto as "Exhibit A." On April 10, 2012, this Court entered an Order
on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel, stating that "within twenty (20) days of the date of this
Order, the Defendant EDWARDS shall produce any non-privileged documents as
identified in Paragraph 13 of EDWARDS' [sic] Motion to Compel and Amend Protective
Order." See Order entered April 10, 2012, a true and correct copy of which is attached
hereto as "Exhibit B." The Order further avowed that "[n]othing in this Order shall


constitute any waiver or ruling upon any privilege that may apply to said documents and
the Defendant EDWARDS and/or others may file an objection to any such documentation
on any privilege grounds and shall file a privilege log specifically identifying such
documents." See Exhibit B (emphasis added). Accordingly, all responses were due on or
before April 30, 2012.
On May 9, 2012, Plaintiff received Defendant Edwards' untimely response to the
afore-referenced Request to Produce. A perfunctory review of the items provided by
Edwards established that his response was both incomplete and deficient. Edwards'
response contained nothing more than partial electronic communications between himself
and three or four of the countless reporters with whom he had communications during the
relevant time period. On or about May 15, 2012, and after sending a letter to Defendant
explaining his non-compliance, Plaintiff filed its initial Motion to Compel and for
Sanctions.
In response thereto, Defendant served upon Plaintiff a privilege log' as to the
electronic mail correspondence between Edwards and a member of the press, Conchita
Sarnoff. There was no reference, objection, or privilege asserted as to the rest of the items
Defendant was ordered by this Court to produce; to wit:
"[a]ll e-mails, data,
correspondence, and similar documents dated April 1, 2008 through August 1, 2010 by and
between Bradley J. Edwards. Scott W. Rothstein, Marc Nurik, Cara Holmes, Mike Fisten
and any one of the following regarding or mentioning Jeffrey Epstein in any way: (a) the
U.S. Attorney's Office, (b) the State Attorney's Office, (c) the Federal Bureau of
‹ While the document is labeled "Privilege log," it contains an objection to each of the Discovery
requests as "irrelevant" notwithstanding that this Court has already deemed them as relevant.
2


Investigation, (d) Conchita Sarnoff, and (e) any other news employees or reporters." See
Exhibit A. Accordingly, Defendant's response undeniably corroborates that he wholly
disregarded this Court's Order, failed to comply with this Court's Order to produce the
items responsive to Plaintiff's Request, and failed to provide any privilege log with respect
to any of the afore-referenced parties, with the single exception being Sarnoff.
Finally, and of paramount concern, is the undeniable fact that these requests were
due to Plaintiff on or before April 30, 2012; two full weeks before the deadline imposed
upon Plaintiff by the Federal court to turn over documents Plaintiff intends to utilize in its
deposition of Scott Rothstein; the Co-Defendant in this case. The documents were due to
the Federal court on or before May 15, 2012, and Plaintiff's deposition of Scott Rothstein
is now scheduled for the week of June 11, 2012; dates about which Defendant has
firsthand knowledge and has been aware for several weeks. To date, and notwithstanding
the above, Defendant has willingly, intentionally, and irrefutably ignored an Order from
this Court resulting in his calculated thwarting of the discovery process. As such, and as
demonstrated more fully below, Plaintiff's requested order and sanctions are warranted.
MEMORANDUM OF LAW
As this Court is aware, it Ordered Defendant Edwards to provide the following
specific items:
[a]ll e-mails, data, correspondence, and similar documents dated April 1,
2008 through August 1, 2010 by and between Bradley J. Edwards. Scott W.
Rothstein, Marc Nurik, Cara Holmes, Mike Fisten and any one of the
following regarding or mentioning Jeffrey Epstein in any way: (a) the U.S.
Attorney's Office, (b) the State Attorney's Office, (c) the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, (d) Conchita Sarnoff, and (e) any other news employees or
reporters.
3


See Exhibit A. The Order further avowed that Defendant Edwards was permitted to assert
any alleged privilege by filing "a privilege log specifically identifying such documents."
See Exhibit B. Edwards failed to either provide the items requested or a privilege log as to
his communications with all listed entities/persons, other than Sarnoff.? It is well-settled
law that if a party alleges that information requested from it is protected by privilege, then
a privilege log must be prepared and attached to the response, or the privilege is waived.
See TIG Insurance Corp. of America v. Johnson, 799 So. 2d 339 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001)
(stating that failure to provide a reason for privilege and prepare a privilege log constitutes
waiver of the privilege) (emphasis added). Here, Edwards fails to either respond to the
Request to Produce or assert any privilege as Court ordered, with the single afore-
referenced exception. A court has the inherent power to implement and enforce effective
judicial proceedings pursuant to pretrial rules. As such, when a party fails to comply with
a pretrial order, a court has broad discretion in determining sanctions. First Republic
Corp. of America v. Hayes, 431 So. 2d 624 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983). Accordingly, Defendant
Edwards' inapposite and patent disregard for this Court's Order mandates sanctions.
Finally, Plaintiff certifies that he "in good faith, has conferred or attempted to
confer with the person or party failing to make the discovery in an effort to secure the
information or material without court action." FLA. R.Civ. P. 1.380. A true and correct
copy of the correspondence sent to Defendant Edwards regarding the first Motion to
2 The applicability and veracity of Edwards' assertion that the communications between himself
and Sarnoff are
"Work Product Privilege" will be addressed in a separate Motion and
Memorandum of Law, as Plaintiff opposes this contention and submits that it has no basis in law
or fact.
4


Compel is attached hereto as "Exhibit C," and the second, which was sent after receiving
the Sarnoff "privilege log" is attached hereto as "Exhibit D." Pursuant to Rule 1.380 of the
Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, Epstein is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees
necessitated by Defendant's flagrant disregard of both this Court's Order and the afore-
referenced Rules of Civil Procedure.
CONCLUSION
Accordingly, for all of the reasons delineated above and in reliance upon the
applicable law cited herein, Plaintiff Jeffrey Epstein respectfully requests that this Court,
yet again, Order Defendant Bradley Edwards to respond in full to Plaintiff's Request to
Produce, award attorney's fees as sanctions, and such other and further relief as this Court
deems proper, including any available for Edwards' interference and impediment regarding
the deposition of Scott Rothstein.
WE HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was served
upon all parties listed on the attached service list, via facsimile and US Mail, this May 30,
2012.

CIVIL DIVISION AG
CASE NO. 502009CA040800XXXXMB
Judge David F. Crow
JEFFREY EPSTEIN,
Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant,
V.
SCOTT ROTHSTEIN, individually, and
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS, individually,
Defendants/Counter-Plaintiffs.
PLAINTIFF JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S MOTION TO COMPEL
AND AMEND PROTECTIVE ORDER
Plaintiff, Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), by and through his undersigned counsel, moves this
Court to compel the production of documents from Defendant, BRADLEY J, EDWARDS
("Edwards") and to amend and lift a protective order relating to a subpoena to the Bankruptcy
Trustee. The gröunds för this Motion are as follows:
On April 12, 2010, Epstein sent a Request to Produce to Edwards requesting the
following documents:
3. All emails, data, correspondence, memos, or similar documents between
Bradley J. Edwards, Scött W. Rothstein, William Bergery and Russell Adler
and/or any attorney or representative of RRA and any investor or third party
(person or mity regarding feel eatin or tic hates oretic prain
2. On May 11, 2010, Edwards served bis response to this request by stating:
3. Objection as to communications to or from investigators as that is
protected by the work-product and/or attorney-client privilege.
Exhibit A


Epstein v. Rothstein and Edwards
Case No. 502009CA040800XXXXMB/Div. AG .
Epstein's Motion to Compel and Amend Protective Order
Although Edwards did not object to producing all documents requested, he did
not produce any documents responsive to this request. Nor did Edwards, who asserted privilege,
prepare a privilege log related to this request. It is important to note that this request went to
documents within Edwards' possession and control as opposed to documents that were produced
from the Bankruptcy Trustee.
+
The documents requested in #3 were also requested by means of a subpoena to the
Bankruptcy Trustee dated April 17, 2010. After several motions and orders to compel, Edwards
finally prepared a privilege log relating to communications to and from the investigators among
others. However, Edwards did not produce any e-mails or documents between the lawyers at
RRA and (a) the U.S. Attorney's Office, (b) the State Attorney's Office, (c) the Federal Bureau of
Investigation — to which he had not objected and for which he did not claim a privilege on his
privilege log.
Edwards did not produce any documents by and between RRA lawyers or
representatives and third parties such as Conchita Sarnoff, a reporter, and any other news
employees or reporters. Edwards has not identified any communication with reporters on his
privilege log.
On January 3, 2011, Epstein sent a second subpoena requesting the following
documents from the Bankruptcy Trustee:
Any and all email commutications by/between any attorney and/or
employee of the former Rothstein law firm, including but not litted to, Scott
Rothstein, Russell Adler, William Berger, Michael Fisten, Ken Jenne, David
Boden, Deborah Villegas, Andrew Barnett, Patrick Roberts, Richard Fandry,
Christina Kitterman, Gary Farmer and Bradley Edwards, on the one hand, and any
of the following regarding Jeffrey Epstein:
2


Epstein v. Rothstein and Edwards
Case No. 502.009CA040800XXXXMB/Div. AG
Epstein's Motion to Compel and Amend Protective Order
U.S. Attorney's office;
State of Florida Attorney's Office
Federal Bureau of Investigations;
City of Palm Beach Police Department;
Any investigator working for the State of Florida;
Any attorney, law firm and any agent of any attorney or law firm who represented
any individual with a claim against Jeffrey Epstein.
On April 1, 2011, Epstein sent a Request to Produce to Edwards seeking
documents that support Edwards' contention that Epstein has waived his Fifth Amendment right
by speaking to reporters.
On May 5, 2011, Edwards responded with objections and claims of privilege.
Edwards did not prepare a privilege log even though the Court ordered him to do so.
On July 14, 2011, this Court entered an Order granting a Motion for Protective
Order without prejudice relating to the records on the subpoena to the Bankruptcy Trustee based
on scope and relevancy. A copy of the Order is attached to this Motion as Exhibit 1.
10. On November 11, 2011, Edwards filed his Renewed Motion for Summary
Judgment and a lengthy Statement of Undisputed Facts it which he purported to identify
"suminary judgment evidence" on which he relied. Such "undisputed facts" reference and/or
quote the Palm Beach Police Incident Report (see 13), correspondence from the U.S. Attorney's
Office to Epstein (see 1T5, 19, 25), correspondence between the U.S. Attorney's Office and
Epstein's counsel (see TT6, 20, 27) to support Edwards' argument that he acted in good faith and
that Epstein "violated his agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Ofüce..." (128). Edwards also
quotes correspondence from the U.S. Attorney's Office to Epstein's counsel (see 16) specifically
in support of his contention that there was a "joint attempt to minimize Epstein's civil exposure."


Epsteiu v. Rothstein and Edwards
Case No. 502009CA040800XXXXMB/Div. AG
Epstein's Motion to Compel and Amend Protective Order
(Id.). Edwards also cites from a proposed plea agreement (see 120) in support of his contention
that Epstein engaged in witness tampering.
11.
Edwards has also referred to statements allegedly made by Epstein to a reporter in
11180-81 of his Undisputed Statement of Facts. Edwards contends Epstein's alleged statements to
reporters waives his Fifth Amendment rights.
12.
As a result of Edwards relying on communications with the government and
reporters as part of his Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and to support his contention
that Epstein has waived his Fifth Amendment rights by speaking with reporters, discovery is
highly appropriate on these issues and should be permitted.
13.
Epstein wishes to amend and narrow his request to the Trustee to obtain the
following records:
All e-mails, data, correspondence, and similar documents dated April 1, 2008
through August 1, 2010 by and between Bradley J. Edwards, Scott W.
Rothstein, Mare Nurik, Cara Holmes, Mike Fisten and any one of the
following regarding or mentioning Jeffrey Epstein in aty way: (a) the U.S.
Attorney's Office, (b) the State Attorney's Ofüice, (c) the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, (d) Conchita Sarnoff, and (e) any other news employees or
reporters.
14.
The described documents are not privileged, so no in camera review is necessary.
Epstein's request has been narrowed so that compliance and production are not overly broad or
burdensome. The request is relevant and necessary in order for Epstein to defend Edwards'
Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, including Edwards' contention that Epstein has
waived his Fifth Amendment rights by discussions and communications with media, news
employees or reporters.

Epstein v. Rothstein and Edwards
