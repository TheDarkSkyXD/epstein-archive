Dear Sirs:

My name is Jeffrey Epstein and I am the owner and authorized user of the
following two Yahoo! accounts: (1) jeeproject; and (2) 
littlestjeff.  My password for each of these accounts is as 
follows:
                               jeeproject - neptune          
                                littlestjeff - mermaid 

I am writing in reference to a telephone complaint  reference no. 
6262176  lodged on Thursday, October  25, 2007 with your premium care 
support line.  At that time I reported that I have reason to suspect 
that unauthorized third parties have been accessing one or both of my 
accounts and reading and distributing copies of my confidential e-mails.
I requested copies 
of all records of access, use and other activity with respect to these 
accounts over the past three months in order to discover the source of 
the unauthorized access during that three-month 
period.  Your premium care support representative advised me to e-mail 
my request to you at reportabuse@yahoo-inc.com.  
Please be advised that I have already changed my user passwords for both
e-mail accounts, so further changes in my passwords are not necessary at
this time.

I did as I was instructed and e-mailed to reportabuse@yahoo-inc.com my 
request for Yahoo!'s records of account access and activity for the 
above two accounts and I received the following form response from your 
reportabuse@yahoo-inc.com address:

Hello,

Thank you for writing to Yahoo! Mail.

Unfortunately, your message to us was missing the full Internet headers.
Without the full headers we will be unable to further investigate this 
matter. 

Email headers are used to deliver a message over the Internet and 
contain a record of the specific route that the message took. Full 
header information is included in every message that is sent. Depending 
on the setup of your email account and/or server, however, this header 
information may not be visible or otherwise available to you. Please 
consult with your email administrator or email program help information 
to determine the availability of this full header information.

At this time, we will need you to forward a copy of the message, as 
opposed to sending it as an attachment, because we are currently unable 
to accept attachments. Please include the following in your report of 
email abuse to assist us in a prompt and full evaluation:

1. Original subject line -- Please forward the email with a subject 
identical to the original subject.

2. Complete headers -- Email programs often display abbreviated headers.
To learn how to display the full headers in a Yahoo! Mail account, 
please visit the Yahoo! Mail Help Desk at:

 http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/config/config-11.html

For non-Yahoo! Mail users, please refer to the URL below for information
on how to get the full headers for your particular email client: 

 http://www.haltabuse.org/help/headers/index.shtml 

3. Complete message body -- Please include the complete, unedited 
content of the email message in question. Please do not change or edit 
the message in any way.

If reports of email abuse are missing any one of these three items, we 
may not be able to further investigate such reports. We appreciate your 
efforts in reporting this abuse to Yahoo!.

I await your response so I may investigate your issue.

Thank you again for contacting Yahoo! Mail.

Regards,

Obviously, Yahoo!'s response was completely inapplicable to my request. 
I was not writing to report an abusive e-mail.  So I again called your 
customer support line to request all Yahoo! records of account activity 
and access with respect to my Yahoo! accounts "jeeproject" and 
"littlestjeff" during the past three months.  The customer support line 
gave me the address to which I am e-mailing my request to you at this 
time.

Please advise me as to what I must do in order to obtain from Yahoo! all
records of account access and activity from August 1, 2007 through 
November 15, 2007 with respect to my two Yahoo! accounts "jeeproject" 
and "littlestjeff".

If this e-mail request is sufficient to obtain such records, please 
forward such records to me at 
my e-mail address littlestjeff@yahoo.com.  If additional information is 
required of me in order to process my request, please advise what 
additional information is required by e-mail to littlestjeff@yahoo.com. 
In any response you provide, I would appreciate it if you would also 
provide me with the name and telephone number of a representative with 
whom I may speak personally regarding this request.
Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Jeffrey E. Epstein
