Hi Jee

This is a follow up to my first email I sent a few days back which you have
not noticed so I have decided to follow up again.

I am sending you our new version nose vents upon its release.

New set will be sent to the address in your previous order.

Please take 30 seconds of your time to leave a comment on the previous
version at amazon on the link below:

https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/?asin=3DB01DKR1AUI:5

Also, reply to this email confirming that you have commented and I will
proceed with the shipment of your new set upon its release based on you
letting me know that your comment has been submitted.

I look forward to your reply.

Yours in Health & Happiness,
