- **Aligned audio browser grid**: The Audio Browser now uses a 3-column grid by default on desktop (similar to Video), with taller cards that can show multiple transcript snippets, tags, and metadata without truncation.
- **Transcript match previews**: Transcript snippets under each audio card highlight the query text inline and reserve space for at least 2–3 lines of context, aligning the browsing and in-player transcript experiences.
- **Entity evidence endpoints**: Backend now exposes `/api/entities/:id/evidence` and `/api/entities/:id/relations` backed by mention-level evidence and relation evidence, ready to power richer entity Evidence/Graph views.

## v10.9.0 (2026-01-17) - Unredact Integration & Timecoded Links

- **Unredacted PDFs in ingest**: The core ingestion pipeline now calls `scripts/unredact.py` for PDFs before text extraction, stripping vector/image redaction overlays where possible while preserving originals and failing safely to the old behavior if Python dependencies are missing.
- **Transcript-first media search**: Audio transcript search now shows concrete transcript segments with timestamps under each result, making it obvious what text matched and letting investigators jump straight to that moment in the recording.
- **Deep-linked timecodes**: Audio and Video players’ share buttons now copy URLs that include both media id and timecode (`?id=…&t=…`), so any quote in a transcript can be linked and shared at exact playback position.
- **Deployment hygiene**: Standardized `npm run deploy:prod` → `deploy-to-production.sh` and encoded the rule that version history must always be updated when shipping to production.

## v10.7.1 (2026-01-15) - Media Player UX Polish
