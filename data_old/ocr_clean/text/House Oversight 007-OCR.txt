A RESOURCE GUIDE TO THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT By the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022496

FOREWORD We are pleased to announce the publication of A Resource Guide to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a critically important statute for combating corruption around the globe. Corruption has corrosive effects on democratic institutions, undermining public accountability and diverting public resources from impor- tant priorities such as health, education, and infrastructure. When business is won or lost based on how much a company is willing to pay in bribes rather than on the quality of its products and services, law-abiding companies are placed at a com- petitive disadvantage—and consumers lose. For these and other reasons, enforcing the FCPA is a continuing priority at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Guide is the product of extensive efforts by experts at DOJ and SEC, and has benefited from valuable input from the Departments of Commerce and State. It endeavors to provide helpful information to enterprises of all shapes and sizes— from small businesses doing their first transactions abroad to multi-national corporations with subsidiaries around the world. The Guide addresses a wide variety of topics, including who and what is covered by the FCPA's anti-bribery and accounting provisions; the definition of a "foreign official"; what constitute proper and improper gifts, travel and entertainment expenses; the nature of facilitating payments; how successor liability applies in the mergers and acquisitions context; the hallmarks of' an effective corporate compliance program; and the different types of civil and criminal resolutions available in the FCPA context. On these and other topics, the Guide takes a multi-faceted approach, setting forth in detail the statutory require- ments while also providing insight into DOJ and SEC enforcement practices through hypotheticals, examples of enforce- ment actions and anonymized declinations, and summaries of applicable case law and DOJ opinion releases. The Guide is an unprecedented undertaking by DOJ and SEC to provide the public with detailed information about our FCPA enforcement approach and priorities. We are proud of the many lawyers and staff who worked on this project, and hope that it will be a useful reference for companies, individuals, and others interested in our enforcement of the Act.

Corporate bribery is bad business. In our free market system it is basic that the sale of products should take place on the basis of price, quality, and service. Corporate bribery is fundamentally destructive of this basic tenet. Corporate bribery of foreign officials takes place primarily to assist corporations in gaining business. Thus foreign corporate bribery affects the very stability of overseas business. Foreign corporate bribes also affect our domestic competitive climate when domestic firms engage in such practices as a substitute for healthy com- petition for foreign business.! —United States Senate, 1977 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022502

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022503

chapter 1 Introduction INTRODUCTION Congress enacted the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA or the Act) in 1977 in response to revelations of widespread bribery of foreign officials by U.S. companies. The Act was intended to halt those corrupt practices, create a level playing field for honest businesses, and restore public confidence in the integ- rity of the marketplace. The FCPA contains both anti-bribery and accounting provisions. The anti-bribery provisions prohibit U.S. per- sons and businesses (domestic concerns), U.S. and foreign public companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States or which are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (issuers), and certain foreign persons and businesses acting while in the territory of the United States (territorial jurisdiction) from making corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain or retain business. The accounting provisions require issuers to make and keep accurate books and records and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The accounting provisions also prohibit individu- als and businesses from knowingly falsifying books and records or knowingly circumventing or failing to imple- ment a system of internal controls. The Department of Justice (DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) share FCPA enforcement authority and are committed to fighting for- eign bribery through robust enforcement. An important component of this effort is education, and this resource guide, prepared by DOJ and SEC staff, aims to provide businesses and individuals with information to help them abide by the law, detect and prevent FCPA violations, and implement effective compliance programs. The Costs of Corruption Corruption is a global problem. In the three decades since Congress enacted the FCPA, the extent of corporate bribery has become clearer and its ramifications in a trans- national economy starker. Corruption impedes economic growth by diverting public resources from important pri- orities such as health, education, and infrastructure. It undermines democratic values and public accountability and weakens the rule of law? And it threatens stability and security by facilitating criminal activity within and across HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022504

borders, such as the illegal trafficking of people, weapons, and drugs.* International corruption also undercuts good governance and impedes U.S. efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end poverty, and combat crime and terror- ism across the globe. Corruption is also bad for business. Corruption is anti-competitive, leading to distorted prices and disadvan- taging honest businesses that do not pay bribes. It increases the cost of doing business globally and inflates the cost of government contracts in developing countries. Corruption also introduces significant uncertainty into business trans- actions: Contracts secured through bribery may be legally unenforceable, and paying bribes on one contract often results in corrupt officials makingever-increasing demands. Bribery has destructive effects within a business as well, undermining employee confidence in a company's manage- ment and fostering a permissive atmosphere for other kinds of corporate misconduct, such as employee self-dealing, embezzlement, financial fraud, and anti-competitive behavior.'° Bribery thus raises the risks of doing business, putting a company's bottom line and reputation in jeop- ardy. Companies that pay bribes to win business ultimately undermine their own long-term interests and the best inter- ests of their investors. Historical Background Congress enacted the FCPA in 1977 after revela- tions of widespread global corruption in the wake of the Watergate political scandal. SEC discovered that more than 400 U.S. companies had paid hundreds of millions of dol- lars in bribes to foreign government officials to secure busi- ness overseas." SEC reported that companies were using secret "slush funds" to make illegal campaign contributions in the United States and corrupt payments to foreign offi- cials abroad and were falsifying their corporate financial records to conceal the payments.!2 Congress viewed passage of the FCPA as critical to stopping corporate bribery, which had tarnished the image of U.S. businesses, impaired public confidence in the financial integrity of U.S. companies, and hampered the efficient functioning of the markets. As Congress No problem does more to alienate citizens from their political leaders and institutions, and to undermine political stability and economic development, than endemic corruption among the government, political party leaders, judges, and bureaucrats. - USAID Anti-Corruption Strategy recognized when it passed the FCPA, corruption imposes enormous costs both at home and abroad, leading to mar- ket inefficiencies and instability, sub-standard products, and an unfair playing field for honest businesses.4 By enacting a strong foreign bribery statute, Congress sought to minimize these destructive effects and help companies resist corrupt demands, while addressing the destruc- tive foreign policy ramifications of transnational brib- ery! The Act also prohibited off-the-books accounting through provisions designed to "strengthen the accuracy of the corporate books and records and the reliability of the audit process which constitute the foundations of our system of corporate disclosure. "6 In 1988, Congress amended the FCPA to add two affirmative defenses: (1) the local law defense; and (2) the reasonable and bona fide promotional expense defense.!? Congress also requested that the President negotiate an international treaty with members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to prohibit bribery in international business transactions by many of the United States' major trading partners! Subsequent negotiations at the OECD culminated in the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials in International Business Transactions (Anti-Bribery Convention), which, among other things, required parties to make it a crime to bribe foreign officials.!

DOJ Contact Information Deputy Chief (FCPA Unit) Fraud Section, Criminal Division Bond Building 1400 New York Ave, N.W. Washington, DC 20005 Telephone: (202) 514-7023 Facsimile: (202) 514-7021 Email: FCPA. Fraud@usdoj.gov In 1998, the FCPA was amended to conform to the requirements of the Anti-Bribery Convention. These amendments expanded the FCPA's scope to: (1) include payments made to secure "any improper advantage"; (2) reach certain foreign persons who commit an act in fur- therance of a foreign bribe while in the United States; (3) cover public international organizations in the definition of "foreign official"; (4) add an alternative basis for juris- diction based on nationality; and (5) apply criminal pen- alties to foreign nationals employed by or acting as agents of U.S. companies.2° The Anti-Bribery Convention came into force on February 15, 1999, with the United States as a founding party. National Landscape: Interagency Efforts DOJ and SEC share enforcement authority for the CPA's anti-bribery and accounting provisions.?' They also work with many other federal agencies and law enforce- ment partners to investigate and prosecute FCPA viola- tions, reduce bribery demands through good governance programs and other measures, and promote a fair playing field for U.S. companies doing business abroad. Department of Justice DOJ has criminal FCPA enforcement authority over "issuers" (i.e., public companies) and their officers, chapter 1 Introduction directors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting on the issuer's behalf. DOJ also has both criminal and civil enforce- ment responsibility for the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions over "domestic concerns" —which include (a) U.S. citizens, nationals, and residents and (b) U.S. businesses and their officers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders act- ing on the domestic concern's behalf-and certain foreign persons and businesses that act in furtherance of an FCPA violation while in the territory of the United States. Within DOJ, the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division has pri- mary responsibility for all FCPA matters.? FCPA matters are handled primarily by the FCPA Unit within the Fraud Section, regularly working jointly with U.S. Attorneys' Offices around the country. DOJ maintains a website dedicated to the FCPA and its enforcement at http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/ fepa/. The website provides translations of the FCPA in numerous languages, relevant legislative history, and selected documents from FCPA-related prosecutions and resolutions since 1977, including charging documents, plea agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agree- ments, press releases, and other relevant pleadings and court decisions. The website also provides copies of opinions issued in response to requests by companies and individuals under DOJ's FCPA opinion procedure. The procedures for submit- ting a request for an opinion can be found at http://www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/docs/frgncrpt.pdf and are discussed further in Chapter 9. Individuals and companies wishing to disclose information about potential FCPA viola- tions are encouraged to contact the FCPA Unit at the tele- phone number or email address above. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC is responsible for civil enforcement of the FCPA over issuers and their officers, directors, employees, agents, 4 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022506

SEC Contact Information FCPA Unit Chief Division of Enforcement U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, N.E.

SEC's Division of Enforcement has responsibility for investigating and prosecuting FCPA violations. In 2010, SEC's Enforcement Division created a specialized FCPA Unit, with attorneys in Washington, D.C. and in regional offices around the country, to focus specifically on FCPA enforcement. The Unit investigates potential FCA violations; facilitates coordination with DOJ's FCPA program and with other federal and international law enforcement partners; uses its expert knowledge of the law to promote consistent enforce- ment of the FCPA; analyzes tips, complaints, and referrals regarding allegations of foreign bribery; and conducts pub- lic outreach to raise awareness of anti-corruption efforts and good corporate governance programs. The FCPA Unit maintains a "Spotlight on FCPA" section on SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/ fcpa.shtml. The website, which is updated regularly, pro- vides general information about the Act, links to all SEC enforcement actions involving the FCPA, including both federal court actions and administrative proceedings, and contains other useful information. Individuals and companies with information about possible FCPA violations by issuers may report them to the Enforcement Division via SEC's online Tips, Complaints and Referral system, http://www.sec.gov/complaint/tip- scomplaint.shtml. They may also submit information to SEC's Office of the Whistleblower through the same online system or by contacting the Office of the Whistleblower at (202) 551-4790. Additionally, investors with questions about the FCPA can call the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at (800) SEC-0330. For more information about SEC's Whistleblower Program, under which certain eligible whistleblowers may be entitled to a monetary award if their information leads to certain SEC actions, see Chapter 8. Law Enforcement Partners DOT's FCPA Unit regularly works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate potential FCPA violations. The FBI's International Corruption Unit has pri- mary responsibility for international corruption and fraud investigations and coordinates the FBI's national FCPA enforcement program. The FBI also has a dedicated FCPA squad of FBI special agents (located in the Washington Field Office) that is responsible for investigating many, and providing support for all, of the FBI's FCPA investigations. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation regularly investigate potential FCPA violations. A number of other agencies are also involved in the fight against international corruption, including the Department of 'Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which has helped lead a number of FCPA investigations. Departments of Commerce and State Besides enforcement efforts by DOJ and SEC, the U.S. government is also working to address corrup- tion abroad and level the playing field for U.S. businesses through the efforts of the Departments of Commerce and State. Both Commerce and State advance anti-corruption and good governance initiatives globally and regularly assist U.S. companies doing business overseas in several HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022507

important ways. Both agencies encourage U.S. businesses to seek the assistance of U.S embassies when they are con- fronted with bribe solicitations or other corruption-related issues overseas. 3 The Department of Commerce offers a num- ber of important resources for businesses, including the International Trade Administration's United States and Foreign Commercial Service (Commercial Service). The Commercial Service has export and industry specialists located in over 100 U.S. cities and 70 countries who are available to provide counseling and other assistance to U.S. businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies, regarding exporting their products and services. Among other things, these specialists can help a U.S. company con- duct due diligence when choosing business partners or agents overseas. The International Company Profile Program, for instance, can be part of a U.S. business' evaluation of poten- tial overseas business partners Businesses may contact the Commercial Service through its website, http://export.gov/ eac/, or directly at its domestic and foreign offices.? Additionally, the Department of Commerce's Office of the General Counsel maintains a website, http://www. commerce.gov/os/ogc/transparency-and-anti-bribery- initiatives, that contains recent articles and speeches, links to translations of the FCPA, a catalogue of anti-corruption resources, and a list of international conventions and ini- tiatives. The Trade Compliance Center in the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration hosts a website with anti-bribery resources, http://tcc.export. gov/Bribery. This website contains an online form through which U.S. companies can report allegations of foreign bribery by foreign competitors in international business transactions.26 The Department of Commerce also pro- vides information to companies through a number of U.S. and international publications designed to assist firms in complying with anti-corruption laws. For example, the Department of Commerce has included a new anti-corrup tion section in its Country Commercial Guides, prepared by market experts at U.S. embassies worldwide, that contains information on market conditions for more than 100 coun tries, including information on the FCPA for exporters." chapter 1 Introduction The Department of Commerce has also published a guide, Business Ethics: A Manual for Managing a Responsible Business Enterprise in Emerging Market Economies, which contains information about corporate compliance pro- grams for businesses involved in international trade.28 The Departments of Commerce and State also pro- vide advocacy support, when determined to be in the national interest, for U.S. companies bidding for foreign government contracts. The Department of Commerce's Advocacy Center, for example, supports U.S. businesses competing against foreign companies for international con- tracts, such as by arranging for the delivery of an advocacy message by U.S. government officials or assisting with unan- ticipated problems such as suspected bribery by a competi- tor.29 The Department of State's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (specifically, its Office of Commercial and Business Affairs) similarly assists U.S. firms doing business overseas by providing advocacy on behalf of U.S. businesses and identifying risk areas for U.S. businesses; more infor- mation is available on its website, http://www.state.gov/e/ eb/ca/. Also, the Department of State's economic officers serving overseas provide commercial advocacy and support for U.S. companies at the many overseas diplomatic posts where the Commercial Service is not represented. The Department of State promotes U.S. government interests in addressing corruption internationally through country-to-country diplomatic engagement; development of and follow-through on international commitments relat- ing to corruption; promotion of high-level political engage- ment (e.g., the G20 Anticorruption Action Plan); public outreach in foreign countries; and support for building the capacity of foreign partners to combat corruption. In fiscal year 2009, the U.S. government provided more than $1 billion for anti-corruption and related good governance assistance abroad. 6 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022508

7 The Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) manages U.S. participation in many multilateral anti-corruption political and legal initiatives at the global and regional level. INL also funds and coordinates significant efforts to assist countries with combating corruption through legal reform, training, and other capacity-building efforts. Inquiries about the U.S. government's general anti-corruption efforts and implementation of global and regional anti-corruption ini- tiatives may be directed to INL on its website, http://www. state.gov/j/inl/c/crime/corr/index.htm, or by email to: anticorruption@state.gov. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has developed several anti-corruption programs and publications, information about which can be found at http://www.usaid.gov/what- we-do/democracy-human-rights-and-governance/promot- ing-accountability-transparency. Finally, the Department of State's brochure "Fighting Global Corruption: Business Risk Management, available at http://www.ogc.doc.gov/pdfs/ Fighting_ Global_Corruption.pdf, provides guidance about corporate compliance programs as well as international anti- corruption initiatives. International Landscape: Global Anti- Corruption Efforts In recent years, there has been a growing interna- tional consensus that corruption must be combated, and the United States and other countries are parties to a number of international anti-corruption conventions. Under these conventions, countries that are parties undertake commit- ments to adopt a range of preventive and criminal law mea- sures to combat corruption. The conventions incorporate review processes that allow the United States to monitor other countries to ensure that they are meeting their inter- national obligations. Likewise, these processes in turn permit other parties to monitor the United States' anti-corruption laws and enforcement to ensure that such enforcement and legal frameworks are consistent with the United States treaty obligations.® U.S. officials regularly address the subject of corruption with our foreign counterparts to raise awareness of the importance of fighting corruption and urge stronger enforcement of anti-corruption laws and policies. OECD Working Group on Bribery and the Anti- Bribery Convention The OECD was founded in 1961 to stimulate eco- nomic progress and world trade. As noted, the Anti-Bribery Convention requires its parties to criminalize the bribery of foreign public officials in international business transac- tions? As of November 1, 2012, there were 39 parties to the Anti-Bribery Convention: 34 OECD member coun- tries (including the United States) and five non-OECD member countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Russian Federation, and South Africa). All of these parties are also members of the OECD Working Group on Bribery (Working Group 32 The Working Group is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Anti-Bribery Convention, the 2009 Recommendation of the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, and related instruments. Its mem- bers meet quarterly to review and monitor implementation of the Anti-Bribery Convention by member states around the world. Each party undergoes periodic peer review.33 This peer-review monitoring system is conducted in three phases. The Phase 1 review includes an in-depth assess- ment of each country's domestic laws implementing the Convention. The Phase 2 review examines the effectiveness of each country's laws and anti-bribery efforts. The final phase is a permanent cycle of peer review (the first cycle of which is referred to as the Phase 3 review) that evaluates a country's enforcement actions and results, as well as the country's efforts to address weaknesses identified during the Phase 2 review.* All of the monitoring reports for the par- ties to the Convention can be found on the OECD website and can be a useful resource about the foreign bribery laws of the OECD Working Group member countries.35 The United States was one of the first countries to undergo all three phases of review.

Phase 3 review of the United States, which was completed in October 2010, the Working Group commended U.S. efforts to fight transnational bribery and highlighted a number of best practices developed by the United States. The report also noted areas where the United States anti- bribery efforts could be improved, including consolidat- ing publicly available information on the application of the FCPA and enhancing awareness among small- and medium-sized companies about the prevention and detec- tion of foreign bribery. This guide is, in part, a response to these Phase 3 recommendations and is intended to help businesses and individuals better understand the FCPA.37 U.N. Convention Against Corruption The United States is a state party to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on October 31, 2003, and entered into force on December 14, 2005.38 The United States ratified the UNCAC on October 30, 2006. The UNCAC requires parties to crimi- nalize a wide range of corrupt acts, including domestic and foreign bribery and related offenses such as money launder- ing and obstruction of justice. The UNCAC also estab- lishes guidelines for the creation of anti-corruption bodies, codes of conduct for public officials, transparent and objec- tive systems of procurement, and enhanced accounting and auditing standards for the private sector. A peer review mechanism assesses the implementation of the UNCAC by parties to the Convention, with a focus in the first round on criminalization and law enforcement as well as inter- national legal cooperation39 The United States has been reviewed under the Pilot Review Programme, the report of which is available on DOJ's website. As of November 1, 2012, 163 countries were parties to the UNCAC.4° Other Anti-Corruption Conventions The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (IACAC) was the first international anti-corruption con- vention, adopted in March 1996 in Caracas, Venezuela, by members of the Organization of American States.* chapter 1 Introduction The IACAC requires parties (of which the United States is one) to criminalize both foreign and domestic brib- ery. A body known as the Mechanism for Follow-Up on the Implementation of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (MESICIC) monitors parties compli- ance with the IACAC. As of November 1, 2012, 31 coun- tries were parties to MESICIC. The Council of Europe established the Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) in 1999 to monitor countries' compliance with the Council of Europe's anti- corruption standards, including the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption.*2 These stan- dards include prohibitions on the solicitation and receipt of bribes, as well as foreign bribery. As of November 1, 2012, GRECO member states, which need not be members of the Council of Europe, include more than 45 European countries and the United States. * The United States has been reviewed under both MESICIC and GRECO, and the reports generated by those reviews are available on DOT's website. 8 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022510

chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions THE FCPA: ANTI-BRIBERY PROVISIONS The FCPA addresses the problem of international corruption in two ways: (1) the anti-bribery provisions, which are discussed below, prohibit individuals and businesses from bribing foreign government officials in order to obtain or retain business and (2) the accounting provisions, which are discussed in Chapter 3, impose certain record keeping and internal control requirements on issuers, and prohibit individuals and companies from knowingly falsifying an issuer's books and records or circumventing or failing to implement an is- suer's system of internal controls. Violations of the FCPA can lead to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions, and remedies, including fines, disgorgement, and/or imprisonment. In general, the FCPA prohibits offering to pay, pay- ing, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influ- ence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. 4* their officers, directors, employees, agents, and sharehold- ers; (2) "domestic concerns" and their officers, directors, employees, agents, and shareholders; and (3) certain per- sons and entities, other than issuers and domestic concerns, acting while in the territory of the United States. Who Is Covered by the Anti-Bribery Provisions? The FCPA's anti-bribery provisions apply broadly to three categories of persons and entities: (1) "issuers" and Issuers-15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1 Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), which can be found at 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1, contains the anti-bribery provision governing 10 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022512

How Can I Tell If My Company Is an "Issuer"? • It is listed on a national securities exchange in the United States (either stock or American Depository Receipts); or • The company's stock trades in the over-the- counter market in the United States and the company is required to file SEC reports. • To see if your company files SEC reports, go to SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov/edgar/ searchedgar/webusers.htm. issuers.'s A company is an "issuer" under the FCPA if it has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or is required to file periodic and other reports with SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.* In practice, this means that any company with a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange in the United States, or any company with a class of securi- ties quoted in the over-the-counter market in the United States and required to file periodic reports with SEC, is an issuer. A company thus need not be a U.S. company to be an issuer. Foreign companies with American Depository Receipts that are listed on a U.S. exchange are also issuers. 48 As of December 31, 2011, 965 foreign companies were reg- istered with SEC.49 Officers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting on behalf of an issuer (whether U.S. or foreign nationals), and any co-conspirators, also can be prosecuted under the FCPA.5° Domestic Concerns—15 U.S.C. § 78dd-2 The FCPA also applies to "domestic concerns." "' A domestic concern is any individual who is a citizen, national, or resident of the United States, or any corporation, part- nership, association, joint-stock company, business trust, unincorporated organization, or sole proprietorship that is organized under the laws of the United States or its states, territories, possessions, or commonwealths or that has its principal place of business in the United States. 2 Officers, 11 directors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting on behalf of a domestic concern, including foreign nationals or companies, are also covered.53 Territorial Jurisdiction—15 U.S.C. § 78dd-3 The FCPA also applies to certain foreign nationals or entities that are not issuers or domestic concerns. Since 1998, the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions have applied to foreign persons and foreign non-issuer entities that, either directly or through an agent, engage in any act in further- ance of a corrupt payment (or an offer, promise, or authori- zation to pay) while in the territory of the United States." Also, officers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting on behalf of such persons or entities may be subject to the FCPA's anti-bribery prohibitions. What Jurisdictional Conduct Triggers the Anti- Bribery Provisions? The FCPA's anti-bribery provisions can apply to conduct both inside and outside the United States. Issuers and domestic concerns—as well as their officers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders—may be prosecuted for using the U.S. mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in furtherance of a corrupt payment to a foreign official. The Act defines "interstate commerce" as "trade, commerce, transportation, or communication among the several States, or between any foreign country and any State or between any State and any place or ship outside thereof ..."57 The term also includes the intrastate use of any interstate means of communication, or any other interstate instrumentality & Thus, placing a telephone call or sending an e-mail, text message, or fax from, to, or through the United States involves interstate commerce-as does sending a wire transfer from or to a U.S. bank or otherwise using the U.S. banking system, or traveling across state bor- ders or internationally to or from the United States. Those who are not issuers or domestic concerns may be prosecuted under the FCPA if they directly, or through an agent, engage in any act in furtherance of a corrupt pay- ment while in the territory of the United States, regardless of HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022513

whether they utilize the U.S. mails or a means or instrumen- tality of interstate commerce." Thus, for example, a foreign national who attends a meeting in the United States that fur- thers a foreign bribery scheme may be subject to prosecution, as may any co-conspirators, even if they did not themselves attend the meeting. A foreign national or company may also be liable under the FCPA if it aids and abets, conspires with, or acts as an agent of an issuer or domestic concern, regardless of whether the foreign national or company itself takes any action in the United States. 6° In addition, under the "alternative jurisdiction" pro- vision of the FCPA enacted in 1998, U.S. companies or persons may be subject to the anti-bribery provisions even if they act outside the United States! The 1998 amend- ments to the FCPA expanded the jurisdictional coverage of the Act by establishing an alternative basis for jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction based on the nationality principle. In particular, the 1998 amendments removed the requirement that there be a use of interstate commerce (e.g., wire, email, telephone call) for acts in furtherance of a corrupt payment chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions to a foreign official by U.S. companies and persons occur- ring wholly outside of the United States.63 What Is Covered?-The Business Purpose Test The FCPA applies only to payments intended to induce or influence a foreign official to use his or her posi- tion "in order to assist ... in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person."* This requirement is known as the "business purpose test" and is broadly interpreted.6s Not surprisingly, many enforcement actions involve bribes to obtain or retain government contracts." The FCPA also prohibits bribes in the conduct of business or Hypothetical: FCPA Jurisdiction Company A, a Delaware company with its principal place of business in New York, is a large energy company that operates globally, including in a number of countries that have a high risk of corruption, such as Foreign Country. Company A's shares are listed on a national U.S. stock exchange. Company A enters into an agreement with a European company (EuroCo) to submit a joint bid to the Oil Ministry to build a refinery in Foreign Country. EuroCo is not an issuer. Executives of Company A and EuroCo meet in New York to discuss how to win the bid and decide to hire a purported third-party consultant (Intermediary) and have him use part of his "commission" to bribe high-ranking officials within the Oil Ministry. Intermediary meets with executives at Company A and EuroCo in New York to finalize the scheme. Eventually, millions of dollars in bribes are funneled from the United States and Europe through Intermediary to high-ranking officials at the Oil Ministry, and Company A and EuroCo win the contract. A few years later, a front page article alleging that the contract was procured through bribery appears in Foreign Country, and DOJ and SEC begin investigating whether the FCPA was violated. Based on these facts, which entities fall within the FCPA's jurisdiction? All of the entities easily fall within the CPA's jurisdiction. Company A is both an "issuer" and a "domestic concern" under the FCPA, and Intermediary is an "agent" of Company A. EuroCo and Intermediary are also subject to the FCPA's territorial jurisdiction provision based on their conduct while in the United States. Moreover, even if Euro Co and Intermediary had never taken any actions in the territory of the United States, they can still be subject to jurisdiction under a traditional application of conspiracy law and may be subject to substantive FCPA charges under Pinkerton liability, namely, being liable for the reasonably foreseeable substantive FCPA crimes committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. 12 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022514

Examples of Actions Taken to Obtain or Retain Business • Winning a contract • Influencing the procurement process • Circumventing the rules for importation of products • Gaining access to non-public bid tender information • Evading taxes or penalties • Influencing the adjudication of lawsuits or enforcement actions • Obtaining exceptions to regulations • Avoiding contract termination to gain a business advantage. For example, bribe payments made to secure favorable tax treatment, to reduce or elimi- nate customs duties, to obtain government action to pre- vent competitors from entering a market, or to circumvent a licensing or permit requirement, all satisfy the business purpose test. "8 In 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit addressed the business purpose test in United States v. Kay and held that bribes paid to obtain favorable tax treatment— which reduced a company's customs duties and sales taxes on imports—could constitute payments made to "obtain or retain" business within the meaning of the FCPA 6 The court explained that in enacting the FCPA, "Congress meant to prohibit a range of payments wider than only those that directly influence the acquisition or retention of govern- ment contracts or similar commercial or industrial arrange- ments.? The Kay court found that "[t]he congressional target was bribery paid to engender assistance in improving the business opportunities of the payor or his beneficiary, irrespective of whether that assistance be direct or indirect, and irrespective of whether it be related to administering the law, awarding, extending, or renewing a contract, or executing or preserving an agreement.? Accordingly, Kay 13 held that payments to obtain favorable tax treatment can, under appropriate circumstances, violate the FCPA: Avoiding or lowering taxes reduces operating costs and thus increases profit margins, thereby freeing up funds that the business is otherwise legally obligated to expend. And this, in turn, enables it to take any number of actions to the disadvantage of competi- tors. Bribing foreign officials to lower taxes and cus- toms duties certainly can provide an unfair advantage over competitors and thereby be of assistance to the payor in obtaining or retaining business. *** [W]e hold that Congress intended for the FCPA to apply broadly to payments intended to assist the payor, either directly or indirectly, in obtaining or retaining business for some person, and that bribes paid to foreign tax officials to secure illegally reduced customs and tax liability constitute a type of payment that can fall within this broad coverage.? Paying Bribes to Customs Officials In 2010, a global freight forwarding company and six of its corporate customers in the oil and gas industry resolved charges that they paid bribes to customs officials. The companies bribed customs officials in more than ten countries in exchange for such benefits as: • evading customs duties on imported goods • improperly expediting the importation of goods and equipment • extending drilling contracts and lowering tax assessments • obtaining false documentation related to temporary import permits for drilling rigs • enabling the release of drilling rigs and other equipment from customs officials In many instances, the improper payments at issue allowed the company to carry out its existing business, which fell within the FCPA's prohibition on corrupt payments made for the purpose of "retaining" business. The seven companies paid a total of more than $235 million in civil and criminal sanctions and disgorgement. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022515

In short, while the FCPA does not cover every type of bribe paid around the world for every purpose, it does apply broadly to bribes paid to help obtain or retain busi- ness, which can include payments made to secure a wide variety of unfair business advantages.3 What Does "Corruptly" Mean? To violate the FCPA, an offer, promise, or authori- zation of a payment, or a payment, to a government offi- cial must be made "corruptly'"4 As Congress noted when adopting the FCPA, the word "corruptly" means an intent or desire to wrongfully influence the recipient: The word "corruptly" is used in order to make clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must be in- tended to induce the recipient to misuse his official position; for example, wrongfully to direct business to the payor or his client, to obtain preferential legis- lation or regulations, or to induce a foreign official to fail to perform an official function.? Where corrupt intent is present, the FCPA prohibits paying, offering, or promising to pay money or anything of value (or authorizing the payment or offer)? By focus- ing on intent, the FCPA does not require that a corrupt act succeed in its purpose. Nor must the foreign official actually solicit, accept, or receive the corrupt payment for the bribe payor to be liable? For example, in one case, a specialty chemical company promised Iraqi government officials approximately $850,000 in bribes for an upcoming contract. Although the company did not, in the end, make the payment (the scheme was thwarted by the U.S. govern- ment's investigation), the company still violated the FCPA and was held accountable.?? Also, as long as the offer, promise, authorization, or payment is made corruptly, the actor need not know the identity of the recipient; the attempt is sufficient. ° Thus, an executive who authorizes others to pay "whoever you need to" in a foreign government to obtain a contract has violated the FCPA—even if no bribe is ultimately offered or paid. chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions What Does "Willfully" Mean and When Does It Apply? In order for an individual defendant to be criminally liable under the FCPA, he or she must act "willfully"s! Proof of willfulness is not required to establish corporate criminal or civil liability, though proof of corrupt intent is. The term "willfully" is not defined in the FCPA, but it has generally been construed by courts to connote an act committed voluntarily and purposefully, and with a bad purpose, i.e., with "knowledge that [a defendant] was doing a 'bad' act under the general rules of law."83 As the Supreme Court explained in Bryan v. United States, "[a]s a general matter, when used in the criminal context, a 'will- ful' act is one undertaken with a 'bad purpose. In other words, in order to establish a 'willful' violation of a statute, 'the Government must prove that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful'"84 Notably, as both the Second Circuit and Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeals have found, the FCPA does not require the government to prove that a defendant was specifically aware of the FCPA or knew that his conduct violated the FCPA." To be guilty, a defendant must act with a bad pur- pose, i.e., know generally that his conduct is unlawful. What Does "Anything of Value" Mean? In enacting the FCPA, Congress recognized that bribes can come in many shapes and sizes—a broad range of unfair benefits®6 —and so the statute prohibits the corrupt "offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to" a foreign official.®? An improper benefit can take many forms. While cases often involve payments of cash (sometimes in the guise of "consulting fees" or "commissions" given through intermediaries), others have involved travel expenses and 14 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022516

expensive gifts. Like the domestic bribery statute, the FCPA does not contain a minimum threshold amount for corrupt gifts or payments. Indeed, what might be considered a modest payment in the United States could be a larger and much more significant amount in a foreign country. Regardless of size, for a gift or other payment to vio- late the statute, the payor must have corrupt intent—that is, the intent to improperly influence the government official. The corrupt intent requirement protects companies that engage in the ordinary and legitimate promotion of their businesses while targeting conduct that seeks to improp erly induce officials into misusing their positions. Thus, it is difficult to envision any scenario in which the provision of cups of coffee, taxi fare, or company promotional items of nominal value would ever evidence corrupt intent, and neither DOJ nor SEC has ever pursued an investigation on the basis of such conduct. Moreover, as in all areas of federal law enforcement, DOJ and SEC exercise discre- tion in deciding which cases promote law enforcement pri- orities and justify investigation. Certain patterns, however, have emerged: DOJ's and SEC's anti-bribery enforcement actions have focused on small payments and gifts only when they comprise part of a systemic or long-standing course of conduct that evidences a scheme to corruptly pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. These assessments are necessarily fact specific. Cash The most obvious form of corrupt payment is large amounts of cash. In some instances, companies have main- tained cash funds specifically earmarked for use as bribes. One U.S. issuer headquartered in Germany disbursed cor- rupt payments from a corporate "cash desk" and used off- shore bank accounts to bribe government officials to win contracts. In another instance, a four-company joint ven- ture used its agent to pay $5 million in bribes to a Nigerian political party The payments were made to the agent in suitcases of cash (typically in $1 million installments), and, in one instance, the trunk of a car when the cash did not fit into a suitcase? 15 Gifts, Travel, Entertainment, and Other Things of Value A small gift or token of esteem or gratitude is often an appropriate way for business people to display respect for each other. Some hallmarks of appropriate gift-giving are when the gift is given openly and transparently, properly recorded in the giver's books and records, provided only to reflect esteem or gratitude, and permitted under local law. Items of nominal value, such as cab fare, reasonable meals and entertainment expenses, or company promo- tional items, are unlikely to improperly influence an offi- cial, and, as a result, are not, without more, items that have resulted in enforcement action by DOJ or SEC. The larger or more extravagant the gift, however, the more likely it was given with an improper purpose. DOJ and SEC enforce- ment cases thus have involved single instances of large, extravagant gift-giving (such as sports cars, fur coats, and other luxury items) as well as widespread gifts of smaller items as part of a pattern of bribes." For example, in one case brought by DOJ and SEC, a defendant gave a govern- ment official a country club membership fee and a genera- tor, as well as household maintenance expenses, payment of cell phone bills, an automobile worth $20,000, and lim- ousine services. The same official also received $250,000 through a third-party agent.? In addition, a number of FCPA enforcement actions have involved the corrupt payment of travel and entertain- ment expenses. Both DOJ and SEC have brought cases where these types of expenditures occurred in conjunction with other conduct reflecting systemic bribery or other clear indicia of corrupt intent. A case involving a California-based telecommuni- cations company illustrates the types of improper travel and entertainment expenses that may violate the FCPA.4 Between 2002 and 2007, the company spent nearly $7 mil lion on approximately 225 trips for its customers in order to obtain systems contracts in China, including for employees of Chinese state-owned companies to travel to popular tour- ist destinations in the United States." Although the trips were purportedly for the individuals to conduct training at HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022517

Examples of Improper Travel and Entertainment • a $12,000 birthday trip for a government decision- maker from Mexico that included visits to wineries and dinners • $10,000 spent on dinners, drinks, and entertainment for a government official • a trip to Italy for eight Iraqi government officials that consisted primarily of sightseeing and included $1,000 in "pocket money" for each official • a trip to Paris for a government official and his wife that consisted primarily of touring activities via a chauffeur-driven vehicle the company's facilities, in reality, no training occurred on many of these trips and the company had no facilities at those locations. Approximately $670,000 of the $7 million was falsely recorded as "training" expenses.% Likewise, a New Jersey-based telecommunications company spent millions of dollars on approximately 315 trips for Chinese government officials, ostensibly to inspect factories and train the officials in using the company's equipment." In reality, during many of these trips, the offi- cials spent little or no time visiting the company's facilities, but instead visited tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Disney World, Universal Studios, and New York City. Some of the trips were characterized as "factory inspections" or "training" with government customers but consisted primarily or entirely of sightseeing to locations chosen by the officials, typically lasting two weeks and costing between $25,000 and $55,000 per trip. In some instances, the company gave the government officials $500 to $1,000 per day in spend- ing money and paid all lodging, transportation, food, and entertainment expenses. The company either failed to record these expenses or improperly recorded them as "consulting fees" in its corporate books and records. The chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions company also failed to implement appropriate internal con- trols to monitor the provision of travel and other things of value to Chinese government officials." Companies also may violate the FCPA if they give payments or gifts to third parties, like an official's family members, as an indirect way of corruptly influencing a for- eign official. For example, one defendant paid personal bills and provided airline tickets to a cousin and close friend of the foreign official whose influence the defendant sought in obtaining contracts. °° The defendant was convicted at trial and received a prison sentence.!°1 As part of an effective compliance program, a com- pany should have clear and easily accessible guidelines and processes in place for gift-giving by the company's directors, officers, employees, and agents. Though not necessarily appropriate for every business, many larger companies have automated gift-giving clearance pro- cesses and have set clear monetary thresholds for gifts along with annual limitations, with limited exceptions for gifts approved by appropriate management. Clear guidelines and processes can be an effective and efficient means for controlling gift-giving, deterring improper gifts, and protecting corporate assets. The FCPA does not prohibit gift-giving. Rather, just like its domestic bribery counterparts, the FCPA prohibits the payments of bribes, including those disguised as gifts. Charitable Contributions Companies often engage in charitable giving as part of legitimate local outreach. The FCPA does not prohibit charitable contributions or prevent corporations from act- ing as good corporate citizens. Companies, however, can- not use the pretense of charitable contributions as a way to funnel bribes to government officials. 16 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022518

17 For example, a pharmaceutical company used chari- table donations to a small local castle restoration charity headed by a foreign government official to induce the offi- cial to direct business to the company. Although the charity was a bona fide charitable organization, internal documents at the pharmaceutical company's subsidiary established that the payments were not viewed as charitable contributions but rather as "dues" the subsidiary was required to pay for assistance from the government official. The payments con- stituted a significant portion of the subsidiary's total pro- motional donations budget and were structured to allow the subsidiary to exceed its authorized limits. The payments Hypothetical: Gifts, Travel, and Entertainment Company A is a large U.S. engineering company with global operations in more than 50 countries, including a number that have a high risk of corruption, such as Foreign Country. Company A's stock is listed on a national U.S. stock exchange. In conducting its business internationally, Company A's officers and employees come into regular contact with foreign officials, including officials in various ministries and state-owned entities. At a trade show, Company A has a booth at which it offers free pens, hats, t-shirts, and other similar promotional items with Company A's logo. Company A also serves free coffee, other beverages, and snacks at the booth. Some of the visitors to the booth are foreign officials. Is Company A in violation of the FCPA? No. These are legitimate, bona fide expenditures made in connection with the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of Company A's products or services. There is nothing to suggest corrupt intent here. The FCPA does not prevent companies from promoting their businesses in this way or providing legitimate hospitality, including to foreign officials. Providing promotional items with company logos or free snacks as set forth above is an appropriate means of providing hospitality and promoting business. Such conduct has never formed the basis for an CPA enforcement action. At the trade show, Company A invites a dozen current and prospective customers out for drinks, and pays the moderate bar tab. Some of the current and prospective customers are foreign officials under the FCPA. Is Company A in violation of the FCPA? No. Again, the FCPA was not designed to prohibit all forms of hospitality to foreign officials. While the cost here may be more substantial than the beverages, snacks, and promotional items provided at the booth, and the invitees specifically selected, there is still nothing to suggest corrupt intent. Two years ago, Company A won a long-term contract to supply goods and services to the state-owned Electricity Commission in Foreign Country. The Electricity Commission is 100% owned, controlled, and operated by the government of Foreign Country, and employees of the Electricity Commission are subject to Foreign Country's domestic bribery laws. Some Company A executives are in Foreign Country for meetings with officials of the Electricity Commission. The General Manager of the Electricity Commission was recently married, and during the trip Company A executives present a moderately priced crystal vase to the General Manager as a wedding gift and token of esteem. Is Company A in violation of the FCPA? No. It is appropriate to provide reasonable gifts to foreign officials as tokens of esteem or gratitude. It is important that such gifts be made openly and transparently, properly recorded in a company's books and records, and given only where appropriate under local law, customary where given, and reasonable for the occasion. During the course of the contract described above, Company A periodically provides training to Electricity Commission employees at its facilities in Michigan. The training is paid for by the Electricity Commission as part of the contract. Senior officials of the Electricity Commission inform Company A that they want to inspect the facilities and ensure that the training is working well. Company A pays for the airfare, hotel, and transportation for the (cont'd) HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022519

chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions Electricity Commission senior officials to travel to Michigan to inspect Company A's facilities. Because it is a lengthy international flight, Company A agrees to pay for business class airfare, to which its own employees are entitled for lengthy flights. The foreign officials visit Michigan for several days, during which the senior officials perform an appropriate inspection. Company A executives take the officials to a moderately priced dinner, a baseball game, and a play. Do any of these actions violate the FCPA? No. Neither the costs associated with training the employees nor the trip for the senior officials to the Company's facilities in order to inspect them violates the FCPA. Reasonable and bona fide promotional expenditures do not violate the FCPA. Here, Company A is providing training to the Electricity Commission's employees and is hosting the Electricity Commission senior officials. Their review of the execution and performance of the contract is a legitimate business purpose. Even the provision of business class airfare is reasonable under the circumstances, as are the meals and entertainment, which are only a small component of the business trip. Would this analysis be different if Company A instead paid for the senior officials to travel first-class with their spouses for an all-expenses-paid, week-long trip to Las Vegas, where Company A has no facilities? Yes. This conduct almost certainly violates the FCPA because it evinces a corrupt intent. Here, the trip does not appear to be designed for any legitimate business purpose, is extravagant, includes expenses for the officials' spouses, and therefore appears to be designed to corruptly curry favor with the foreign government officials. Moreover, if the trip were booked as a legitimate business expense—such as the provision of training at its facilities—Company A would also be in violation of the CPA's accounting provisions. Furthermore, this conduct suggests deficiencies in Company A's internal controls. Company A's contract with the Electricity Commission is going to expire, and the Electricity Commission is offering the next contract through its tender process. An employee of the Electricity Commission contacts Company A and offers to provide Company A with confidential, non-public bid information from Company A's competitors if Company A will pay for a vacation to Paris for him and his girlfriend. Employees of Company A accede to the official's request, pay for the vacation, receive the confidential bid information, and yet still do not win the contract. Has Company A violated the FCPA? Yes. Company A has provided things of value to a foreign official for the purpose of inducing the official to misuse his office and to gain an improper advantage. It does not matter that it was the foreign official who first suggested the illegal conduct or that Company A ultimately was not successful in winning the contract. This conduct would also violate the FCPA's accounting provisions if the trip were booked as a legitimate business expense and suggests deficiencies in Company A's internal controls. 18 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022520

also were not in compliance with the company's internal policies, which provided that charitable donations gener- ally should be made to healthcare institutions and relate to the practice of medicine. 02 Proper due diligence and controls are critical for charitable giving. In general, the adequacy of measures taken to prevent misuse of charitable donations will depend on a risk-based analysis and the specific facts at hand. In Opinion Procedure Release No. 10-02, DOJ described the due diligence and controls that can minimize the likelihood of an FCPA violation. In that matter, a Eurasian-based sub- sidiary of a U.S. non-governmental organization was asked by an agency of a foreign government to make a grant to a local microfinance institution (MFI) as a prerequisite to the subsidiary's transformation to bank status. The subsid- iary proposed contributing $1.42 million to a local MFI to satisfy the request. The subsidiary undertook an extensive, three-stage due diligence process to select the proposed grantee and imposed significant controls on the proposed grant, including ongoing monitoring and auditing, ear- marking funds for capacity building, prohibiting compen- sation of board members, and implementing anti-corrup- tion compliance provisions. DOJ explained that it would not take any enforcement action because the company's due diligence and the controls it planned to put in place sufficed to prevent an FCPA violation. Other opinion releases also address charitable-type grants or donations. Under the facts presented in those releases, DOJ approved the proposed grant or donation, 103 based on due diligence measures and controls such as: • certifications by the recipient regarding compliance with the FCPA;104% due diligence to confirm that none of the recipient's officers were affiliated with the foreign government at issue: 105 • a requirement that the recipient provide audited financial statements; 106 • a written agreement with the recipient restricting the use of funds. 107 steps to ensure that the funds were transferred to a valid bank account; 108 19 • confirmation that the charity's commitments were met before funds were disbursed; 10 and • on-going monitoring of the efficacy of the program. o Legitimate charitable giving does not violate the FCPA. Compliance with the FCPA merely requires that charitable giving not be used as a vehicle to conceal pay- ments made to corruptly influence foreign officials. Five Questions to Consider When Making Charitable Payments in a Foreign Country: 1. What is the purpose of the payment? 2. Is the payment consistent with the company's internal guidelines on charitable giving? 3. Is the payment at the request of a foreign official? 4. Is a foreign official associated with the charity and, if so, can the foreign official make decisions regarding your business in that country? 5. Is the payment conditioned upon receiving business or other benefits? Who Is a Foreign Official? The FCPA's anti-bribery provisions apply to corrupt payments made to (1) "any foreign official"; (2) "any foreign political party or official thereof"; (3) "any candidate for foreign political office"; or (4) any person, while knowing that all or a portion of the payment will be offered, given, or promised to an individual falling within one of these three categories.'"I Although the statute distinguishes between a "foreign official, "foreign political party or official thereof, and "candidate for foreign political office, the term "for- eign official" in this guide generally refers to an individual falling within any of these three categories. The FCPA defines "foreign official" to include: any officer or employee of a foreign government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof, HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022521

or of a public international organization, or any per- son acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any such government or department, agency, or in- strumentality, or for or on behalf of any such public international organization.!2 As this language makes clear, the FCPA broadly applies to corrupt payments to "any" officer or employee of a foreign government and to those acting on the for- eign government's behalf.'3 The FCPA thus covers cor- rupt payments to low-ranking employees and high-level officials alike.'4 The FCPA prohibits payments to foreign officials, not to foreign governments."S That said, companies contem- plating contributions or donations to foreign governments should take steps to ensure that no monies are used for cor- rupt purposes, such as the personal benefit of individual foreign officials. Department, Agency, or Instrumentality of a Foreign Government Foreign officials under the FCPA include officers or employees of a department, agency, or instrumental- ity of a foreign government. When a foreign government is organized in a fashion similar to the U.S. system, what constitutes a government department or agency is typically clear (e.g., a ministry of energy, national security agency, or transportation authority).' However, governments can be organized in very different ways. ' Many operate through state-owned and state-controlled entities, particularly in such areas as aerospace and defense manufacturing, bank- ing and finance, healthcare and life sciences, energy and extractive industries, telecommunications, and transporta- tion. ' By including officers or employees of agencies and instrumentalities within the definition of "foreign official," the FCPA accounts for this variability. The term "instrumentality" is broad and can include state-owned or state-controlled entities. Whether a particu- lar entity constitutes an "instrumentality" under the FCPA requires a fact-specific analysis of an entity's ownership, control, status, and function.!!? A number of courts have approved final jury instructions providing a non-exclusive chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions list of factors to be considered: • the foreign state's extent of ownership of the entity; • the foreign state's degree of control over the entity (including whether key officers and directors of the entity are, or are appointed by, government officials); • the foreign state's characterization of the entity and its employees; • the circumstances surrounding the entity's creation; • the purpose of the entity's activities; • the entity's obligations and privileges under the foreign state's law; • the exclusive or controlling power vested in the entity to administer its designated functions; • the level of financial support by the foreign state (including subsidies, special tax treatment, government-mandated fees, and loans); • the entity's provision of services to the jurisdiction's residents; whether the governmental end or purpose sought to be achieved is expressed in the policies of the foreign government; and • the general perception that the entity is performing official or governmental functions.!20 Companies should consider these factors when eval- uating the risk of FCPA violations and designing compli- ance programs. DOJ and SEC have pursued cases involving instru- mentalities since the time of the FCPA's enactment and have long used an analysis of ownership, control, status, and function to determine whether a particular entity is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government. For example, the second-ever FCPA case charged by DOJ involved a California company that paid bribes through a Mexican corporation to two executives of a state-owned 20 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022522

Mexican national oil company. '21 And in the early 1980s, DOJ and SEC brought cases involving a $1 million bribe to the chairman of Trinidad and Tobago's racing authority. 22 DOJ and SEC continue to regularly bring FCPA cases involving bribes paid to employees of agencies and instrumentalities of foreign governments. In one such case, the subsidiary of a Swiss engineering company paid bribes to officials of a state-owned and controlled electric- ity commission. The commission was created by, owned by, and controlled by the Mexican government, and it had a monopoly on the transmission and distribution of elec- tricity in Mexico. Many of the commission's board mem- bers were cabinet-level government officials, and the direc- tor was appointed by Mexico's president. Similarly, in another recent case, Miami telecommunications executives were charged with paying bribes to employees of Haiti's state-owned and controlled telecommunications company. The telecommunications company was 97% owned and 100% controlled by the Haitian government, and its direc- tor was appointed by Haiti's president. 24 While no one factor is dispositive or necessarily more important than another, as a practical matter, an entity is unlikely to qualify as an instrumentality if a government does not own or control a majority of its shares. However, there are circumstances in which an entity would qualify as an instrumentality absent 50% or greater foreign gov- ernment ownership, which is reflected in the limited num- ber of DOJ or SEC enforcement actions brought in such situations. For example, in addition to being convicted of funneling millions of dollars in bribes to two sitting presi- dents in two different countries, a French issuer's three subsidiaries were convicted of paying bribes to employees of a Malaysian telecommunications company that was 43% owned by Malaysia's Ministry of Finance. There, notwith- standing its minority ownership stake in the company, the Ministry held the status of a "special shareholder," had veto power over all major expenditures, and controlled impor- tant operational decisions.!? In addition, most senior company officers were political appointees, including the Chairman and Director, the Chairman of the Board of the Tender Committee, and the Executive Director. 26 Thus, 21 despite the Malaysian government having a minority share- holder position, the company was an instrumentality of the Malaysian government as the government nevertheless had substantial control over the company. Companies and individuals should also remember that, whether an entity is an instrumentality of a foreign government or a private entity, commercial (i.e., private- to-private) bribery may still violate the FCPA's accounting provisions, the Travel Act, anti-money laundering laws, and other federal or foreign laws. Any type of corrupt payment thus carries a risk of prosecution. Public International Organizations In 1998, the FCPA was amended to expand the defini- tion of "foreign official" to include employees and representa- tives of public international organizations. 27 A "public inter- national organization" is any organization designated as such by Executive Order under the International Organizations Immunities Act, 22 U.S.C. § 288, or any other organization that the President so designates. 2 Currently, public interna- tional organizations include entities such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Trade Organization, the OECD, the Organization of American States, and numer- ous others. A comprehensive list of organizations designated as "public international organizations" is contained in 22 U.S.C. $ 288 and can also be found on the U.S. Government Printing Office website at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/. How Are Payments to Third Parties Treated? The FCPA expressly prohibits corrupt payments made through third parties or intermediaries. " Specifically, it covers payments made to "any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly" 130 to a foreign official. Many companies doing business in a foreign country retain a local individual or company to help them conduct business. Although these foreign agents may pro- vide entirely legitimate advice regarding local customs and procedures and may help facilitate business transactions, HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022523

companies should be aware of the risks involved in engag- ing third-party agents or intermediaries. The fact that a bribe is paid by a third party does not eliminate the poten- tial for criminal or civil FCPA liability 31 For instance, a four-company joint venture used two agents—a British lawyer and a Japanese trading company-to bribe Nigerian government officials in order to win a series of liquefied natural gas construc- tion projects, 132 Together, the four multi-national cor- porations and the Japanese trading company paid a combined $1.7 billion in civil and criminal sanctions for their decade-long bribery scheme. In addition, the subsidiary of one of the companies pleaded guilty and a number of individuals, including the British lawyer and the former CEO of one of the companies' subsidiaries, received significant prison terms. Similarly, a medical device manufacturer entered into a deferred prosecution agreement as the result of corrupt payments it authorized its local Chinese distributor to pay to Chinese officials. 133 Another company, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals, committed multiple FCPA viola- tions through its agents in Iraq: a Canadian national and the Canadian's companies. Among other acts, the Canadian national paid and promised to pay more than $1.5 million in bribes to officials of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil to secure sales of a fuel additive. Both the company and the Canadian national pleaded guilty to criminal charges and resolved civil enforcement actions by SEC. 134 In another case, the U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight forwarding company was charged with paying bribes on behalf of its customers in several countries. 35 Although the U.S. subsidiary was not an issuer under the FCPA, it was an "agent" of several U.S. issuers and was thus charged directly with violating the FCPA. Charges against the freight for- warding company and seven of its customers resulted in over $236.5 million in sanctions.136 Because Congress anticipated the use of third-party agents in bribery schemes—for example, to avoid actual knowledge of a bribe—it defined the term "knowing" in a way that prevents individuals and businesses from avoiding liability by putting "any person" between themselves and chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions the foreign officials. '37 Under the FCPA, a person's state of mind is "knowing" with respect to conduct, a circumstance, or a result if the person: • is aware that [he] is engaging in such conduct, that such circumstance exists, or that such result is substantially certain to occur; or • has a firm belief that such circumstance exists or that such result is substantially certain to occur: 138 Thus, a person has the requisite knowledge when he is aware of a high probability of the existence of such circum- stance, unless the person actually believes that such circum- stance does not exist. 39 As Congress made clear, it meant to impose liability not only on those with actual knowledge of wrongdoing, but also on those who purposefully avoid actual knowledge: [T)he so-called "head-in-the-sand" problem— vari- ously described in the pertinent authorities as "con- scious disregard," "willful blindness" or "deliberate ignorance" — should be covered so that management officials could not take refuge from the Act's prohi- bitions by their unwarranted obliviousness to any action (or inaction), language or other "signaling de- vice" that should reasonably alert them of the "high probability" of an FCPA violation. 40 Common red flags associated with third parties include: • excessive commissions to third-party agents or consultants; • unreasonably large discounts to third-party distributors; • third-party "consulting agreements" that include only vaguely described services; • the third-party consultant is in a different line of business than that for which it has been engaged; • the third party is related to or closely associated with the foreign official; 22 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022524

• the third party became part of the transaction at the express request or insistence of the foreign official; • the third party is merely a shell company incorpo- rated in an offshore jurisdiction; and • the third party requests payment to offshore bank accounts. Businesses may reduce the FCPA risks associated with third-party agents by implementing an effective com- pliance program, which includes due diligence of any pro- spective foreign agents. United States v. Kozeny, et al. In December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a conscious avoidance instruction given during the 2009 trial of a businessman who was convicted of conspiring to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions by agreeing to make payments to Azeri officials in a scheme to encourage the privatization of the Azerbaijan Republic's state oil company. The court of appeals found that the instruction did not lack a factual predicate, citing evidence and testimony at trial demonstrating that the defendant knew corruption was pervasive in Azerbaijan; that he was aware of his business partner's reputation for misconduct; that he had created two U.S. companies in order to shield himself and other investors from potential liability for payments made in violation of the FCPA; and that the defendant expressed concerns during a conference call about whether his business partner and company were bribing officials. The court of appeals also rejected the defendant's contention that the conscious avoidance charge had improperly permitted the jury to convict him based on negligence, explaining that ample evidence in the record showed that the defendant had "serious concerns" about the legality of his partner's business practices "and worked to avoid learning exactly what [he] was doing," and noting that the district court had specifically instructed the jury not to convict based on negligence. 23 What Affirmative Defenses Are Available? The FCPA's anti-bribery provisions contain two affir- mative defenses: (1) that the payment was lawful under the written laws of the foreign country (the "local law" defense), and (2) that the money was spent as part of demonstrating a product or performing a contractual obligation (the "reason- able and bona fide business expenditure" defense). Because these are affirmative defenses, the defendant bears the burden of proving them. The Local Law Defense For the local law defense to apply, a defendant must establish that "the payment, gift, offer, or promise of any- thing of value that was made, was lawful under the writ- ten laws and regulations of the foreign official's, political party's, party official's, or candidate's country"'41 The defen- dant must establish that the payment was lawful under the foreign country's written laws and regulations at the time of the offense. In creating the local law defense in 1988, Congress sought "to make clear that the absence of written laws in a foreign official's country would not by itself be suf- ficient to satisfy this defense." |42 Thus, the fact that bribes may not be prosecuted under local law is insufficient to establish the defense. In practice, the local law defense arises infrequently, as the written laws and regulations of coun- tries rarely, if ever, permit corrupt payments. Nevertheless, if a defendant can establish that conduct that otherwise falls within the scope of the CPA's anti-bribery provisions was lawful under written, local law, he or she would have a defense to prosecution. In United States v. Kozeny, the defendant unsuccess- fully sought to assert the local law defense regarding the law of Azerbaijan. The parties disputed the contents and appli- cability of Azeri law, and each presented expert reports and testimony on behalf of their conflicting interpretations. The court ruled that the defendant could not invoke the FCPA's affirmative defense because Azeri law did not actually legal- ize the bribe payment. The court concluded that an excep- tion under Azeri law relieving bribe payors who voluntarily HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022525

disclose bribe payments to the authorities of criminal liabil- ity did not make the bribes legal. 43 Reasonable and Bona Fide Expenditures The FCPA allows companies to provide reasonable and bona fide travel and lodging expenses to a foreign official, and it is an affirmative defense where expenses are directly related to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of a company's products or services, or are related to a company's execution or performance of a con- tract with a foreign government or agency.!# Trips that are primarily for personal entertainment purposes, how- ever, are not bona fide business expenses and may violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions. 4 Moreover, when expenditures, bona fide or not, are mischaracterized in a company's books and records, or where unauthorized or improper expenditures occur due to a failure to imple- ment adequate internal controls, they may also violate the FCPA's accounting provisions. Purposeful mischarac- terization of expenditures may also, of course, indicate a corrupt intent. DOJ and SEC have consistently recognized that busi- nesses, both foreign and domestic, are permitted to pay for reasonable expenses associated with the promotion of their products and services or the execution of existing contracts. In addition, DOJ has frequently provided guidance about legitimate promotional and contract-related expenses- addressing travel and lodging expenses in particular- through several opinion procedure releases. Under the cir- cumstances presented in those releases, 4 DOJ opined that the following types of expenditures on behalf of foreign officials did not warrant FCPA enforcement action: • travel and expenses to visit company facilities or operations; • travel and expenses for training; and product demonstration or promotional activities, including travel and expenses for meetings. Whether any particular payment is a bona fide expen- diture necessarily requires a fact-specific analysis. But the following non-exhaustive list of safeguards, compiled from several releases, may be helpful to businesses in evaluating chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions whether a particular expenditure is appropriate or may risk violating the FCPA: • Do not select the particular officials who will par- ticipate in the party's proposed trip or program '47 or else select them based on pre-determined, merit- based criteria. 48 Pay all costs directly to travel and lodging vendors and/or reimburse costs only upon presentation of a receipt. 49 Do not advance funds or pay for reimbursements in cash. So • Ensure that any stipends are reasonable approxima- tions of costs likely to be incurred!' and/or that expenses are limited to those that are necessary and reasonable. '52 Ensure the expenditures are transparent, both within the company and to the foreign government.!53 • Do not condition payment of expenses on any action by the foreign official.!54 • Obtain written confirmation that payment of the expenses is not contrary to local law.!s • Provide no additional compensation, stipends, or spending money beyond what is necessary to pay for actual expenses incurred. '56 Ensure that costs and expenses on behalf of the foreign officials will be accurately recorded in the company's books and records.'57 In sum, while certain expenditures are more likely to raise red flags, they will not give rise to prosecution if they are (1) reasonable, (2) bona fide, and (3) directly related to (4) the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of products or services or the execution or performance of a contract.

What Are Facilitating or Expediting Payments? The FCPA's bribery prohibition contains a narrow exception for "facilitating or expediting payments" made in furtherance of routine governmental action.'9 The facili- tating payments exception applies only when a payment is made to further "routine governmental action" that involves non-discretionary acts. 6 Examples of "routine governmen- tal action" include processing visas, providing police pro- tection or mail service, and supplying utilities like phone service, power, and water. Routine government action does not include a decision to award new business or to continue business with a particular party. Nor does it include acts that are within an official's discretion or that would consti- tute misuse of an official's office. 162 Thus, paying an official a small amount to have the power turned on at a factory might be a facilitating payment; paying an inspector to ignore the fact that the company does not have a valid permit to operate the factory would not be a facilitating payment. Examples of "Routine Governmental Action" An action which is ordinarily and commonly performed by a foreign official in— • obtaining permits, licenses, or other official documents to qualify a person to do business in a foreign country; • processing governmental papers, such as visas and work orders; • providing police protection, mail pickup and delivery, or scheduling inspections associated with contract performance or inspections related to transit of goods across country; • providing phone service, power and water supply, loading and unloading cargo, or protecting perishable products or commodities from deterioration; or • actions of a similar nature. 25 Whether a payment falls within the exception is not dependent on the size of the payment, though size can be telling, as a large payment is more suggestive of corrupt intent to influence a non-routine governmental action. But, like the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions more generally, the facilitating payments exception focuses on the purpose of the payment rather than its value. For instance, an Oklahoma- based corporation violated the FCPA when its subsidiary paid Argentine customs officials approximately $166,000 to secure customs clearance for equipment and materials that lacked required certifications or could not be imported under local law and to pay a lower-than-applicable duty rate. The company's Venezuelan subsidiary had also paid Venezuelan customs officials approximately $7,000 to permit the importation and exportation of equipment and materials not in compliance with local regulations and to avoid a full inspection of the imported goods.163 In another case, three subsidiaries of a global supplier of oil drilling products and services were criminally charged with authorizing an agent to make at least 378 corrupt payments (totaling approximately $2.1 million) to Nigerian Customs Service officials for pref erential treatment during the customs process, including the reduction or elimination of customs duties. 164 Labeling a bribe as a "facilitating payment" in a com- pany's books and records does not make it one. A Swiss offshore drilling company, for example, recorded pay- ments to its customs agent in the subsidiary's "facilitat- ing payment" account, even though company personnel believed the payments were, in fact, bribes. The company was charged with violating both the FCPA's anti-bribery and accounting provisions. 65 Although true facilitating payments are not ille- gal under the FCPA, they may still violate local law in the countries where the company is operating, and the OECD's Working Group on Bribery recommends that all countries encourage companies to prohibit or discourage facilitating payments, which the United States has done regularly. 166 In addition, other countries' foreign bribery laws, such as the United Kingdom's, may not contain an exception for facilitating payments. 67 Individuals and companies should therefore be aware that although true facilitating payments HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022527

are permissible under the FCPA, they may still subject a company or individual to sanctions. As with any expenditure, facilitating payments may still violate the FCPA if they are not properly recorded in an issuer's books and records. 168 chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions Hypothetical: Facilitating Payments Company A is a large multi-national mining company with operations in Foreign Country, where it recently identified a significant new ore deposit. It has ready buyers for the new ore but has limited capacity to get it to market. In order to increase the size and speed of its ore export, Company A will need to build a new road from its facility to the port that can accommodate larger trucks. Company A retains an agent in Foreign Country to assist it in obtaining the required permits, including an environmental permit, to build the road. The agent informs Company A's vice president for international operations that he plans to make a one-time small cash payment to a clerk in the relevant government office to ensure that the clerk files and stamps the permit applications expeditiously, as the agent has experienced delays of three months when he has not made this "grease" payment. The clerk has no discretion about whether to file and stamp the permit applications once the requisite filing fee has been paid. The vice president authorizes the payment. A few months later, the agent tells the vice president that he has run into a problem obtaining a necessary environmental permit. It turns out that the planned road construction would adversely impact an environmentally sensitive and protected local wetland. While the problem could be overcome by rerouting the road, such rerouting would cost Company A $1 million more and would slow down construction by six months. It would also increase the transit time for the ore and reduce the number of monthly shipments. The agent tells the vice president that he is good friends with the director of Foreign Country's Department of Natural Resources and that it would only take a modest cash payment to the director and the "problem would go away." The vice president authorizes the payment, and the agent makes it. After receiving the payment, the director issues the permit, and Company A constructs its new road through the wetlands. Was the payment to the clerk a violation of the FCPA? No. Under these circumstances, the payment to the clerk would qualify as a facilitating payment, since it is a one-time, small payment to obtain a routine, non-discretionary governmental service that Company A is entitled to receive (i.e., the stamping and filing of the permit application). However, while the payment may qualify as an exception to the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions, it may violate other laws, both in Foreign Country and elsewhere. In addition, if the payment is not accurately recorded, it could violate the FCPA's books and records provision. Was the payment to the director a violation of the FCPA? Yes. The payment to the director of the Department of Natural Resources was in clear violation of the FCPA, since it was designed to corruptly influence a foreign official into improperly approving a permit. The issuance of the environmental permit was a discretionary act, and indeed, Company A should not have received it. Company A, its vice president, and the local agent may all be prosecuted for authorizing and paying the bribe. 26 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022528

Does the FCPA Apply to Cases of Extortion or Duress? Situations involving extortion or duress will not give rise to FCPA liability because a payment made in response to true extortionate demands under imminent threat of physical harm cannot be said to have been made with corrupt intent or for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.!6 In enacting the FCPA, Congress recognized that real-world situations might arise in which a business is compelled to pay an official in order to avoid threats to health and safety. As Congress explained, "a payment to an official to keep an oil rig from being dynamited should not be held to be made with the requisite corrupt purpose."170 Mere economic coercion, however, does not amount to extortion. As Congress noted when it enacted the FCPA: "The defense that the payment was demanded on the part of a government official as a price for gaining entry into a mar- ket or to obtain a contract would not suffice since at some point the U.S. company would make a conscious decision whether or not to pay a bribe."'? The fact that the payment was "first proposed by the recipient ... does not alter the cor- rupt purpose on the part of the person paying the bribe."'72 This distinction between extortion and economic coer- cion was recognized by the court in United States v. Kozeny. There, the court concluded that although an individual who makes a payment under duress (i.e., upon threat of physi- cal harm) will not be criminally liable under the FCPA,173 a bribe payor who claims payment was demanded as a price for gaining market entry or obtaining a contract "cannot argue that he lacked the intent to bribe the official because he made the conscious decision' to pay the official 74 While the bribe payor in this situation "could have turned his back and walked away, in the oil rig example, "he could not."s Businesses operating in high-risk countries may face real threats of violence or harm to their employees, and payments made in response to imminent threats to health or safety do not violate the FCPA. If such a situation arises, and to ensure the safety of its employees, companies should immediately contact the appropriate U.S. embassy for assistance. 27 Principles of Corporate Liability for Anti-Bribery Violations General principles of corporate liability apply to the FCPA. Thus, a company is liable when its directors, officers, employees, or agents, acting within the scope of their employ- ment, commit FCPA violations intended, at least in part, to benefit the company. Similarly, just as with any other stat- ute, DOJ and SEC look to principles of parent-subsidiary and successor liability in evaluating corporate liability. Parent-Subsidiary Liability There are two ways in which a parent company may be liable for bribes paid by its subsidiary. First, a parent may have participated sufficiently in the activity to be directly liable for the conduct—as, for example, when it directed its subsidiary's misconduct or otherwise directly participated in the bribe scheme. Second, a parent may be liable for its subsidiary's con- duct under traditional agency principles. The fundamental characteristic of agency is control!? Accordingly, DOJ and SEC evaluate the parent's control-including the parent's knowledge and direction of the subsidiary's actions, both generally and in the context of the specific transaction- when evaluating whether a subsidiary is an agent of the par- ent. Although the formal relationship between the parent and subsidiary is important in this analysis, so are the practi- cal realities of how the parent and subsidiary actually interact. If an agency relationship exists, a subsidiary's actions and knowledge are imputed to its parent.!? Moreover, under traditional principles of respondeat superior, a com- pany is liable for the acts of its agents, including its employ- ees, undertaken within the scope of their employment and intended, at least in part, to benefit the company. 8° Thus, if an agency relationship exists between a parent and a subsidiary, the parent is liable for bribery committed by the subsidiary's employees. For example, SEC brought an administrative action against a parent for bribes paid by the president of its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. In that matter, the subsidiary's president reported directly to the CEO of the parent issuer, and the issuer routinely identified HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022529

the president as a member of its senior management in its annual filing with SEC and in annual reports. Additionally, the parent's legal department approved the retention of the third-party agent through whom the bribes were arranged despite a lack of documented due diligence and an agency agreement that violated corporate policy; also, an official of the parent approved one of the payments to the third-party agent.'' Under these circumstances, the parent company had sufficient knowledge and control of its subsidiary's actions to be liable under the FCPA. Successor Liability Companies acquire a host of liabilities when they merge with or acquire another company, including those aris- ing out of contracts, torts, regulations, and statutes. As a gen- eral legal matter, when a company merges with or acquires another company, the successor company assumes the prede- cessor company's liabilities.!2 Successor liability is an integral component of corporate law and, among other things, pre- vents companies from avoiding liability by reorganizing. 83 Successor liability applies to all kinds of civil and criminal liabilities, '* and FCPA violations are no exception. Whether successor liability applies to a particular corporate transac- tion depends on the facts and the applicable state, federal, and foreign law. Successor liability does not, however, create liability where none existed before. For example, if an issuer were to acquire a foreign company that was not previously subject to the FCPAs jurisdiction, the mere acquisition of that foreign company would not retroactively create FCPA liability for the acquiring issuer. DOJ and SEC encourage companies to conduct pre- acquisition due diligence and improve compliance pro- grams and internal controls after acquisition for a variety of reasons. First, due diligence helps an acquiring company to accurately value the target company. Contracts obtained through bribes may be legally unenforceable, business obtained illegally may be lost when bribe payments are stopped, there may be liability for prior illegal conduct, and the prior corrupt acts may harm the acquiring company's reputation and future business prospects. Identifying these issues before an acquisition allows companies to better chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions evaluate any potential post-acquisition liability and thus properly assess the target's value. Second, due diligence reduces the risk that the acquired company will continue to pay bribes. Proper pre-acquisition due diligence can iden- tify business and regional risks and can also lay the founda- tion for a swift and successful post-acquisition integration into the acquiring company's corporate control and com- pliance environment. Third, the consequences of potential violations uncovered through due diligence can be handled by the parties in an orderly and efficient manner through negotiation of the costs and responsibilities for the inves- tigation and remediation. Finally, comprehensive due dili- gence demonstrates a genuine commitment to uncovering and preventing FCPA violations. In a significant number of instances, DOJ and SEC have declined to take action against companies that voluntarily disclosed and remediated conduct and cooperated with DOJ and SEC in the merger and acquisition context!s6 And DOJ and SEC have only taken action against successor companies in limited cir- cumstances, generally in cases involving egregious and sustained violations or where the successor company directly participated in the violations or failed to stop the misconduct from continuing after the acquisition. In one case, a U.S.-based issuer was charged with books and records and internal controls violations for continuing a kickback scheme originated by its predecessor. ! Another recent case involved a merger between two tobacco leaf merchants, where prior to the merger each company committed FCPA violations through its foreign subsidiaries, involving multiple countries over the course of many years. At each company, the bribes were directed by the parent company's senior management. The two issuers then merged to form a new public company. Under these circumstances—the merger of two public companies that had each engaged in 28 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022530

Practical Tips to Reduce FCPA Risk in Mergers and Acquisitions Companies pursuing mergers or acquisitions can take certain steps to identify and potentially reduce FCPA risks: • M&A Opinion Procedure Release Requests: One option is to seek an opinion from DOJ in anticipation of a potential acquisition, such as occurred with Opinion Release 08-02. That case involved special circumstances, namely, severely limited pre-acquisition due diligence available to the potential acquiring company, and, because it was an opinion release (i.e., providing certain assurances by DOJ concerning prospective conduct), it necessarily imposed demanding standards and prescriptive timeframes in return for specific assurances from DOJ, which SEC, as a matter of discretion, also honors. Thus, obtaining an opinion from DOJ can be a good way to address specific due diligence challenges, but, because of the nature of such an opinion, it will likely contain more stringent requirements than may be necessary in all circumstances. • M&A Risk-Based FCPA Due Diligence and Disclosure: As a practical matter, most acquisitions will typically not require the type of prospective assurances contained in an opinion from DOJ. DOJ and SEC encourage companies engaging in mergers and acquisitions to: (1) conduct thorough risk-based FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence on potential new business acquisitions; (2) ensure that the acquiring company's code of conduct and compliance policies and procedures regarding the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to newly acquired businesses or merged entities; (3) train the directors, officers, and employees of newly acquired businesses or merged entities, and when appropriate, train agents and business partners, on the FCPA and other relevant anti-corruption laws and the company's code of conduct and compliance policies and procedures; (4) conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or merged businesses as quickly as practicable; and (5) disclose any corrupt payments discovered as part of its due diligence of newly acquired entities or merged entities. DOJ and SEC will give meaningful credit to companies who undertake these actions, and, in appropriate circumstances, DOJ and SEC may consequently decline to bring enforcement actions. bribery-both the new entity and the foreign subsidiaries were liable under the FCPA. The new parent entered into a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ and settled a civil action with SEC, while the company's subsidiaries, which also merged, pleaded guilty, 188 More often, DOJ and SEC have pursued enforce- ment actions against the predecessor company (rather than the acquiring company), particularly when the acquiring company uncovered and timely remedied the violations or when the government's investigation of the predecessor company preceded the acquisition. In one such case, an Ohio-based health care company's due diligence of an acquisition target uncovered FCPA vio- lations by the target's subsidiary, and, before the merger was completed, the subsidiary's violations were disclosed to DOJ and SEC. The subsidiary pleaded guilty and paid a $2 million criminal fine,! the acquisition target settled with SEC and paid a $500,000 civil penalty,! and no successor liability was sought against the acquir- ing entity. In another case, a Pennsylvania-based issuer that supplied heating and air conditioning products and services was subject to an ongoing investigation by DOJ and SEC at the time that it was acquired; DOJ and SEC resolved enforcement actions only against the predecessor company, which had by that time become a wholly owned subsidiary of the successor company.!'1 DOJ and SEC have also brought actions only against a predecessor company where its FCPA violations are discov- ered after acquisition. For example, when a Florida-based U.S. company discovered in post-acquisition due diligence that the telecommunications company (a domestic con- cern) it had acquired had engaged in foreign bribery, the successor company disclosed the FCPA violations to DOJ. It then conducted an internal investigation, cooperated fully with DOJ, and took appropriate remedial action— including terminating senior management at the acquired 29 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022531

company. No enforcement action was taken against the suc- cessor, but the predecessor company pleaded guilty to one count of violating the FCPA and agreed to pay a $2 million fine.! Later, four executives from the predecessor company were convicted of FCPA violations, three of whom received terms of imprisonment.!3 On occasion, when an enforcement action has been taken against a predecessor company, the succes- sor seeks assurances that it will not be subject to a future enforcement action. In one such case, a Dutch predeces- sor resolved FCPA charges with DOJ through a deferred prosecution agreement.!4 While both the predecessor and successor signed the agreement, which included a commitment to ongoing cooperation and an improved compliance program, only the predecessor company was charged; in signing the agreement, the successor company gained the certainty of conditional release from criminal liability, even though it was not being pursued for FCPA violations. 5 In another case, after a Connecticut-based company uncovered FCPA violations by a California company it sought to acquire, both companies voluntarily disclosed the conduct to DOJ and SEC.!% The prede- cessor company resolved its criminal liability through a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ that included an $800,000 monetary penalty and also settled with SEC, paying a total of $1.1 million in disgorgement, pre-judg- ment interest, and civil penalties. The successor company proceeded with the acquisition and separately entered into a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ in which it agreed, among other things, to ensure full performance of the predecessor company's non-prosecution agreement. This agreement provided certainty to the successor con- cerning its FCPA liability. 197 Importantly, a successor company's voluntary disclo- sure, appropriate due diligence, and implementation of an effective compliance program may also decrease the likeli- hood of an enforcement action regarding an acquired com- pany's post-acquisition conduct when pre-acquisition due diligence is not possible! chapter 2 The FCPA: Anti-Bribery Provisions 30 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022532

Hypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Not Previously Subject to the FCPA Company A is a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in the United States and whose shares are listed on a national U.S. exchange. Company A is considering acquiring Foreign Company, which is not an issuer or a domestic concern. Foreign Company takes no actions within the United States that would make it subject to territorial jurisdiction. Company A's proposed acquisition would make Foreign Company a subsidiary of Company A. Scenario 1: Prior to acquiring Foreign Company, Company A engages in extensive due diligence of Foreign Company, including: (1) having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Foreign Company's sales and financial data, its customer contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based analysis of Foreign Company's customer base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Foreign Company; and (4) engaging in discussions with Foreign Company's general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding all corruption risks, compliance efforts, and any other corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Foreign Company over the past ten years. This due diligence aims to determine whether Foreign Company has appropriate anti-corruption and compliance policies in place, whether Foreign Company's employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies, how Foreign Company ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated. During the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Foreign Company has made several potentially improper payments in the form of an inflated commission to a third-party agent in connection with a government contract with Foreign Country. Immediately after the acquisition, Company A discloses the conduct to DOJ and SEC, suspends and terminates those employees and the third-party agent responsible for the payments, and makes certain that the illegal payments have stopped. It also quickly integrates Foreign Company into Company A's own robust internal controls, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online and in-person training in the local language. Company A also requires Foreign Company's third-party distributors and other agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti- corruption representations and warranties and audit rights. Based on these facts, could DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A? No. Although DOJ and SEC have jurisdiction over Company A because it is an issuer, neither could pursue Company A for conduct that occurred prior to its acquisition of Foreign Company. As Foreign Company was neither an issuer nor a domestic concern and was not subject to U.S. territorial jurisdiction, DOJ and SEC have no jurisdiction over its pre-acquisition misconduct. The acquisition of a company does not create jurisdiction where none existed before. Importantly, Company A's extensive pre-acquisition due diligence allowed it to identify and halt the corruption. As there was no continuing misconduct post-acquisition, the FCPA was not violated. Scenario 2: Company A performs only minimal and pro forma pre-acquisition due diligence. It does not conduct a risk-based analysis, and its review of Foreign Company's data, contracts, and third-party and distributor agreements is cursory. Company A acquires Foreign Company and makes it a wholly owned subsidiary. Although Company A circulates its compliance policies to all new personnel after the acquisition, it does not translate the compliance policies into the local language or train its new personnel or third-party agents on anti-corruption issues. A few months after the acquisition, an employee in Company A's international sales office (Sales Employee) learns from a legacy Foreign Company employee that for years the government contract that generated most of Foreign Company's revenues depended on inflated commissions to a third-party agent "to make the right person happy at Foreign Government Agency." Sales Employee is told that unless the payments continue the business will likely be lost, which would mean that Company A's new acquisition would quickly become a financial failure. The payments continue for two (cont'd) 31 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022533

After another employee of Company A reports the long-running bribe scheme to a director a reign Government Agency, Company A stops the payments and DOJ and SEC investiga Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC charge Company A? es. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Any charges would no owever, be premised upon successor liability, but rather on Company As post-acquisition bribe payments, whic themselves created criminal and civil liability for Company A. Scenario 3: Inder local law, Company A's ability to conduct pre-acquisition due diligence on Foreign Company is limited. In th ue diligence it does conduct, Company A determines that Foreian Company is doina business in hiah-risk countrie and in high-risk industries but finds no red flags specific to Foreign Company's operations. Post-acquisition, Company A conducts extensive due diligence and determines that Foreign Company had paid bribes to officials with Foreign Government Agency. Company A takes prompt action to remediate the problem, including following the measures set forth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02. Among other actions, it voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and SEC, ensures all bribes are immediately stopped, takes remedial action against all parties involved in the corruption, and quickly incorporates Foreign Company into a robust compliance program and Company A's other internal controls. Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A? DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Companies can follow the measures set forth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02, or seek their own opinions, where adequate pre-acquisition due diligence is not possible. Hypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Already Subject to the FCPA th Company A and Company B are Delaware corporations with their principal offices in the United States. Bo mpanies' shares are listed on a national U.S. exchana Scenario 1: Company A is considering acquiring several of Company B's business lines. Prior to the acquisition, Company A engages in extensive due diligence, including: (1) having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Company B's sales and financial data, its customer contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based analysis of Company B's customer base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Company B; and (4) engaging in discussions with Company B's general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding all corruption risks, compliance efforts, and any other major corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Company B over the past ten years. This due diligence aims to determine whether Company B has appropriate anti-corruption and compliance policies in place, whether Company B's employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies, how Company B ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated. During the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Company B has made several potentially improper payments in connection with a government contract with Foreign Country. As a condition of the acquisition, Company A requires Company B to disclose the misconduct to the government. Company A makes certain that the illegal payments 32 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022534

have stopped and quickly integrates Company B's business lines into Company A's own robust internal controls, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online and in- person training in the local language. Company A also requires Company B's third-party distributors and other agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCA and anti-corruption representations and warranties and audit rights. Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute? DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. DOJ and SEC encourage companies like Company A to conduct extensive FCPA due diligence. By uncovering the corruption, Company A put itself in a favorable position, and, because the corrupt payments have stopped, Company A has no continuing liability. Whether DOJ and SEC might charge Company B depends on facts and circumstances beyond the scope of this hypothetical. DOJ would consider its Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and SEC would consider the factors contained in the Seaboard Report, both of which are discussed in Chapter 5. In general, the more egregious and long-standing the corruption, the more likely it is that DOJ and SEC would prosecute Company B. In certain limited circumstances, DOJ and SEC have in the past declined to bring charges against acquired companies, recognizing that acquiring companies may bear much of the reputational damage and costs associated with such charges. Scenario 2: Company A plans to acquire Company B. Although, as in Scenario 1, Company A conducts extensive due diligence, it does not uncover the bribery until after the acquisition. Company A then makes certain that the illegal payments stop and voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and SEC. It quickly integrates Company B into Company A's own robust internal controls, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online and in-person training in the local language. Company A also requires Company B's third-party distributors and other agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti- corruption representations and warranties and audit rights. Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute? Absent unusual circumstances not contemplated by this hypothetical, DOJ and SEC are unlikely to prosecute Company A for the pre-acquisition misconduct of Company B, provided that Company B still exists in a form that would allow it to be prosecuted separately (e.g., Company B is a subsidiary of Company A). DOJ and SEC understand that no due diligence is perfect and that society benefits when companies with strong compliance programs acquire and improve companies with weak ones. At the same time, however, neither the liability for corruption—nor the harms caused by it— are eliminated when one company acquires another. Whether DOJ and SEC will pursue a case against Company B (or, in unusual circumstances, Company A) will depend on consideration of all the factors in the Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and the Seaboard Report, respectively. Scenario 3: Company A merges with Company B, which is in the same line of business and interacts with the same Foreign Government customers, and forms Company C. Due diligence before the merger reveals that both Company A and Company B have been engaging in similar bribery. In both cases, the bribery was extensive and known by high-level management within the companies. Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute? Yes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company C on the basis of successor liability. Company C is a combination of two companies that both violated the FCPA, and their merger does not eliminate their liability. In addition, since Company C is an ongoing concern, DOJ and SEC may impose a monitorship to ensure that the bribery has ceased and a compliance program is developed to prevent future misconduct. 33 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022535
