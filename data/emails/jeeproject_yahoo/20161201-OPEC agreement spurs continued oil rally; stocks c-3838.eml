The government's October construction spending report is expected to show a rise of 0.6 percent, after a 0.4 percent drop in September. Discount retailer Dollar General (DG), supermarket operator Kroger (KR), and apparel retailer Lands' End (LE) are out with quarterly earnings this morning, while Five Below (FIVE), Smith & Wesson (SWHC), Ulta Salon (ULTA), Workday (WDAY), and Zumiez
 (ZUMZ) will be out with quarterly numbers after today's closing bell.
STOCKS TO WATCH

Rockwell Collins (COL) is being urged to reconsider its planned $6.4 billion purchase of B/E Aerospace, according to Reuters. The urging comes from activist investor and financial advisor Starboard Value, which has taken a stake in the aircraft component maker.
Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) raised its semi-annual dividend by ten percent to 78 cents per share. That brings the total dividend for 2016 to $1.49 per share, up from $1.37 a year ago.PVH (PVH) beat estimates by 20 cents with quarterly profit of $2.60 per share. The apparel maker's revenue was essentially in line with forecasts, but it gave weaker than expected guidance for the current quarter. The company behind brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said it was being cautious in light of macroeconomic and political uncertainty around the globe.Box (BOX) reported an adjusted quarterly loss of 14 cents per share, compared to consensus estimates of a 19 cent loss. The web storage company saw revenue beat Street forecasts, and it also raised its full-year outlook on stronger sales
 trends.Guess (GES) missed estimates by three cents with quarterly earnings of 11 cents per share, and the apparel maker's revenue fell below analyst projections as well. The company also cut its earnings guidance for the year, with restructuring efforts not yet producing the desired results.Praxair (PX) got a boost in its effort to buy German industrial gas maker Linde, with Linde chairman Wolfgang Reitzle reportedly expressing support for the deal. German newspaper Handelsblatt said Reitzle likes the idea of a deal, but is concerned about Praxair moving toward a hostile bid if a deal isn't worked out.Blackstone (BX) owned Invitation Homes has filed confidentially for an initial public offering, according to the Wall Street Journal. Invitation Homes manages the largest pool of rental
 homes in the United States, and the Journal said the offering could come as soon as January.Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other casino operators with establishments in Macau may benefit after November figures showed a fourth straight month of growth, up 14.4 percent from a year earlier. The four-month rise comes after more than two years of declining gaming revenue.
