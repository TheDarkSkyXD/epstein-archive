BACKGROUND
A. Jeffrey Epstein's Conviction and the CVRA Suit
The origins of this case lie in a decade-old criminal proceeding
against financier Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). On June 30, 2008, Epstein
pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting, and procuring a
person under the age of eighteen for, prostitution. The charges
stemmed from sexual activity with privately hired "masseuses," some
of whom were under eighteen, Florida's age of consent. Pursuant to
an agreement with state and federal prosecutors, Epstein pleaded to
the state charges. He received limited jail-time, registered as a sex
offender, and agreed to pay compensation to his victims. In return,
prosecutors declined to bring federal charges.
Shortly after Epstein entered his plea, two of his victims,
proceeding as "Jane Doe 1" and "Jane Doe 2," filed suit against the
Government in the Southern District of Florida under the Crime
Victims' Rights Act ("CVRA"). The victims sought to nullify the plea
5


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page6 of 25
agreement, alleging that the Government failed to fulfill its legal
obligations to inform and consult with them in the process leading up
to Epstein's plea deal.!
On December 30, 2014, two additional unnamed victims-one
of whom has now self-identified as Plaintiff-Appellee Virginia Giuffre
("'Giuffre") — petitioned to join in the CVRA case. These petitioners
included in their filings not only descriptions of sexual abuse by
Epstein, but also new allegations of sexual abuse by several other
prominent individuals, "including numerous prominent American
politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-
known Prime Minister, and other world leaders," as well as
Dershowitz (a long-time member of the Harvard Law School faculty
who had worked on Epstein's legal defense) and Defendant-Appellee
Ghislaine Maxwell ("Maxwell").2
Dershowitz moved to intervene, seeking to "strike the
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and to
request a show cause order to the attorneys that have made them."3
Exercising its authority to "strike from a pleading an insufficient
1 On February 21, 2019, the Florida District Court ruled that federal
prosecutors had violated the CVRA by failing to adequately notify the two victims-
plaintiffs of the plea deal. The District Court has not yet determined the appropriate
remedy. See Doe 1 v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1204-17 (S.D. Fla. 2019).
2 Doe 1 v. United States, No. 08-CV-80736-KAM, 2015 WL 11254692, at *2 (S.D.
Fla. Apr. 7, 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).

defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous
matter ... on its own,"4 the Florida District Court (Kenneth A. Marra,
Judge) sua sponte struck all allegations against additional parties from
the pleadings, including those against Dershowitz, and therefore
denied Dershowitz's motion as moot."
The stricken allegations, however, quickly found their way into
the press, and several media outlets published articles repeating
Giuffre's accusations. In response to the allegations, on January 3,
2015, Maxwell's publicist issued a press statement declaring that
Giuffre's allegations "against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue" and that
her "claims are obvious lies."6
B. Giuffre Sues Maxwell
On September 21, 2015, Giuffre filed the underlying action
against Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. Giuffre alleged
that Maxwell had defamed her through this and other public
statements. Extensive and hard-fought discovery followed. Due to the
volume of sealing requests filed during discovery, on August 9, 2016,
the District Court entered a Sealing Order that effectively ceded
control of the sealing process to the parties themselves. The Sealing
Order disposed of the requirement that the parties file individual letter
briefs to request sealing and prospectively granted all of the parties'

7


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page8 of 25
future sealing requests. In total, 167 documents-nearly one-fifth of
the docket-were filed under seal. These sealed documents include,
inter alia, motions to compel discovery, motions for sanctions and
adverse inferences, motions in limine, and similar material.
On January 6, 2017, Maxwell filed a motion for summary
judgment. The parties submitted their memoranda of law and
supporting exhibits contesting this motion under seal. On March 22,
2017, the District Court denied the motion in a heavily redacted 76-
page opinion. Once again, the entire summary judgment record,
including the unredacted version of the District Court opinion
denying summary judgment, remained under seal. On May 24, 2017,
Maxwell and Giuffre executed a settlement agreement, and the case
was closed the next day.
C. Motions to Intervene and Unseal
Over the course of the litigation before Judge Sweet, three
outside parties attempted to unseal some or all of the sealed material.
On August 11, 2016, Dershowitz moved to intervene, seeking to unseal
three documents that, he argues, demonstrate that Giuffre invented
the accusations against him. On January 19, 2017, Cernovich, an
independent blogger
and self-described
"popular political
journalist," moved to intervene, seeking to unseal the summary
judgment record, and Dershowitz joined his motion. On April 6, 2018,
after the case had settled, the Herald moved to intervene and unseal
7 Br. Appellant (Cernovich) 4.
8


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page9 of 25
the entire docket. The District Court granted each of these motions to
intervene, but denied the related requests to unseal in orders entered
November 2, 2016, May 3, 2017, and August 27, 2018, respectively.
The Appellants timely appealed from each of the orders
denying their respective motions to unseal. Although each Appellant
seeks the release of a different set of documents, all argue that the
District Court failed to analyze the documents individually or
properly apply the presumption of public access to court documents.
We therefore ordered that the appeals be heard in tandem and held
argument on March 6, 2019.
On March 11, 2019, we issued an order to show cause why we
"should not unseal the summary judgment motion, including any
materials filed in connection with this motion, and the District Court's
summary judgment decision." The parties timely filed their
responses.
II. DISCUSSION
There are two categories of sealed material at issue in these
appeals: (1) the summary judgment record, which includes the parties'
summary judgment briefs, their statements of undisputed facts, and
incorporated exhibits; and (2) court filings made in the course of the
discovery process and with respect to motions in limine. In this
Opinion, we explain that our law requires the unsealing of the
& Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 18-2868-cv, Docket No. 138.
9


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page10 of 25
summary judgment materials and individualized review of the
remaining sealed materials.
While the law governing public access to these materials is
largely settled, we have not yet adequately addressed the potential
harms that often accompany such access. These harms are apparent.
Over forty years ago, the Supreme Court observed that, without
vigilance, courts' files might "become a vehicle for improper
purposes.
Our legal process is already susceptible to abuse.
Unscrupulous litigants can weaponize the discovery process to
humiliate and embarrass their adversaries. Shielded by the "litigation
privilege, "10 bad actors can defame opponents in court pleadings or
depositions without fear of lawsuit and liability. Unfortunately, the
presumption of public access to court documents has the potential to
exacerbate these harms to privacy and reputation by ensuring that
damaging material irrevocably enters the public record.
We therefore take the opportunity to describe the tools available
to district courts in protecting the integrity of the judicial process, and
emphasize the courts' responsibility to exercise these powerful tools.
We also caution the public to critically assess allegations contained in
judicial pleadings.

A. Standard of Review
When reviewing a district court's decision to seal a filing or
maintain such a seal, "we examine the court's factual findings for clear
error, its legal determinations de novo, and its ultimate decision to seal
or unseal for abuse of discretion."11
B. The Summary Judgment Materials
With respect to the first category of materials, it is well-settled
that "documents submitted to a court for its consideration in a
summary judgment motion are-as a matter of law-judicial
documents to which a strong presumption of access attaches, under
both the common law and the First Amendment."12 In light of this
strong First Amendment presumption, "continued sealing of the
documents may be justified only with specific, on-the-record findings
that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the
sealing order is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim."13
11 Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139
(2d Cir. 2016).
12 Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir. 2006). We
observe that our holding in Lugosch relies on the general principle that parties may
"be assumed to have supported their papers with admissible evidence and non-
frivolous arguments." Id. at 122. Insofar as a district court has, through striking a
filing, specifically found that assumption inapplicable, the categorical rule in
Lugosch may not apply. See notes 42-43 and accompanying text, post.
13 Id. at 124. Examples of such countervailing values may include,
depending on the circumstances, preserving "the right of an accused to
fundamental fairness in the jury selection process," Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court
11


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page12 of 25
In this case, the District Court erred in several respects. 14 First, it
failed to give proper weight to the presumption of access that attaches
to documents filed in connection with summary judgment motions.
The District Court reasoned that the summary judgment materials
were "entitled to a lesser presumption of access" because "summary
judgment was denied by the Court."15 In assigning a "lesser
presumption" to such materials, the District Court relied on a single
sentence of dicta from our decision in United States v. Amodeo.16 We
have since clarified, however, that this sentence was based on a
"quotation from a partial concurrence and partial dissent in the D.C.
Circuit... [and] is thus not the considered decision of either this court
or the D.C. Circuit."17 In fact, we have expressly rejected the
proposition that " different types of documents might receive different
of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984); the protection of attorney-client
privilege, Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 125; "the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency," SEC. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232 (2d Cir. 2001); and "the
privacy interest of those who resist disclosure," id.
1 Our discussion here focuses specifically on the District Court's denial of
the Herald's motion to unseal the entire record. Because this decision grants relief
to all Appellants, we need not discuss any separate, additional error in the District
Court's denial of the earlier motions to unseal.
15 Giuffre, 325 F. Supp. 3d at 444.
16 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) ("'Amodeo II") ("One judge [in the District
of Columbia Circuit] has pointed out, for example, that where a district court
denied the summary judgment motion, essentially postponing a final determination
of substantive legal rights, the public interest in access is not as pressing." (internal
quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original)).
17 Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 121.
12


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page13 of 25
weights of presumption based on the extent to which they were relied
upon in resolving [a] motion [for summary judgment]."18
Second, in contravention of our precedent, the District Court
failed to review the documents individually and produce "specific, on-
the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher
values."19 Instead, the District Court made generalized statements
about the record as a whole.2 This too was legal error.
Finally, upon reviewing the summary judgment materials in
connection with this appeal, we find that there is no countervailing
privacy interest sufficient to justify their continued sealing. Remand
with respect to these documents is thus unnecessary. Accordingly, and
to avoid any further delay, we order that the summary judgment
documents (with minimal redactions) be unsealed upon issuance of
our mandate.2
18 Id. at 123.
19 Id. at 124.
20 See, e.g., Giuffre, 325 F. Supp. 3d at 445 (summarily concluding that all
"It)he Summary Judgment Judicial Documents openly refer to and discuss these
allegations [of sexual assault and sexual trafficking] in comprehensive detail, and
that those allegations "establish[] a strong privacy interest here").
21 Cf. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 127 (ordering that "the mandate shall issue
forthwith" to expedite the unsealing process).
22 Upon issuance of our mandate, a minimally redacted version of the
summary judgment record will be made accessible on the Court of Appeals docket.
We have implemented minimal redactions to protect personally identifying
information such as personal phone numbers, contact lists, birth dates, and social
13


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page14 of 25
C. The Remaining Sealed Materials
The law governing disclosure of the remaining sealed material
in this case is only slightly more complex. The Supreme Court has
recognized a qualified right "to inspect and copy judicial records and
documents. "2 In defining "judicial records and documents," we have
emphasized that "the mere filing of a paper or document with the
court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial document subject to
the right of public access."2 Instead, "the item filed must be relevant
to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial
process in order for it to be designated a judicial document."25
As our precedent makes clear, a court "perform|s] the judicial
function" not only when it rules on motions currently before it, but
also when properly exercising its inherent "supervisory powers.!"26 A
security numbers. We have also redacted the names of alleged minor victims of
sexual abuse from deposition testimony and police reports, as well as deposition
responses concerning intimate matters where the questions were likely only
permitted - and the responses only compelled -because of a strong expectation of
continued confidentiality. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2. While we appreciate the views
expressed in Judge Pooler's separate opinion, the panel majority believes that the
efforts invested by three former district judges in reviewing these materials
adequately address those concerns.
23 Nixon, 435 U.S. at 597-98.
24 United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995) (" Amodeo I").
25 Id.
26 Cf. United States v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 863 F.3d 125, 135 (2d Cir. 2017)
(explaining that, in considering whether the report of a monitor charged with
assessing compliance with a deferred prosecution agreement is a judicial
14


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page15 of 25
document is thus "relevant to the performance of the judicial function"
if it would reasonably have the tendency to influence a district court's
ruling on a motion or in the exercise of its supervisory powers, without
regard to which way the court ultimately rules or whether the
document ultimately in fact influences the court's decision.27
Accordingly, if in applying these standards, a court determines that
documents filed by a party are not relevant to the performance of a
judicial function, no presumption of public access attaches.28
Once an item is deemed relevant to the exercise of judicial
power, "the weight to be given the presumption of access must be
governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of Article
III judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those
document, "lilf the district court's conception of its supervisory power in this
context were correct, the Monitor's Report would quite obviously be relevant to the
performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process" (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Whether a specific judicial decision constitutes a
"performance of the judicial function" is a question of law. Accordingly, we review
such determinations de novo. Id. at 134.
27 Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145-46 (concluding that documents were relevant to
the performance of a judicial function because they would have "informed" the
district court's decision whether to discharge or retain a Receiver); see also FTC. v.
Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 409 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing Federal Rule of
Evidence 401's "having any tendency" definition of relevance in determining
whether documents were "judicial documents").
28 As we explain below, there are several (often preferable) tools beyond
sealing that district courts can use to protect their dockets from becoming a vehicle
for irrelevant-and potentially defamatory —accusations. See Section D, post.
15


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page16 of 25
monitoring the federal courts."29 Thus, while evidence introduced at
trial or in connection with summary judgment enjoys a strong
presumption of public access, documents that "play only a negligible
role in the performance of Article III duties" are accorded only a low
presumption that "amounts to little more than a prediction of public
access absent a countervailing reason."30 Documents that are never
filed with the court, but simply "passed between the parties in
discovery, lie entirely beyond the presumption's reach. "31
The remaining sealed materials at issue here include filings
related to, inter alia, motions to compel testimony, to quash trial
subpoenae, and to exclude certain deposition testimony. All such
motions, at least on their face, call upon the court to exercise its Article
III powers. Moreover, erroneous judicial decision-making with respect
to such evidentiary and discovery matters can cause substantial harm.
Such materials are therefore of value "to those monitoring the federal
courts."32 Thus, all documents submitted in connection with, and
relevant to, such judicial decision-making are subject to at least some
presumption of public access.33

31 Id.
32 Id. at 1049.
33 In previous decisions, we have identified an important exception to this
general rule: the presumption of public access does not apply to material that is
submitted to the court solely so that the court may decide whether that same
16


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page17 of 25
Although a court's authority to oversee discovery and control
the evidence introduced at trial surely constitutes an exercise of
judicial power, we note that this authority is ancillary to the court's
core role in adjudicating a case. Accordingly, the presumption of
public access in filings submitted in connection with discovery
disputes or motions in limine is generally somewhat lower than the
presumption applied to material introduced at trial, or in connection
with dispositive motions such as motions for dismissal or summary
judgment.34 Thus, while a court must still articulate specific and
substantial reasons for sealing such material, the reasons usually need
not be as compelling as those required to seal summary judgment
filings.
Here, the precise basis for the District Court's decision to deny
the motion to unseal these remaining materials is unclear. In the three
paragraphs devoted to the issue, the District Court emphasized the
potential for embarrassment "given the highly sensitive nature of the
underlying allegations," and concluded that "the documents sealed in
the course of discovery were neither relied upon by [the District] Court
in the rendering of an adjudication, nor necessary to or helpful in
resolving a motion."35 It is therefore unclear whether the District Court
held that these materials were not judicial documents (and thus are
material must be disclosed in the discovery process or shielded by a Protective
Order. See TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233.

not subject to a presumption of public access), or found that privacy
interests outweighed a limited right of public access.
On either interpretation, however, the District Court's holding
was error. Insofar as the District Court held that these materials are not
judicial documents because it did not rely on them in adjudicating a
motion, this was legal error. As explained above, the proper inquiry is
whether the documents are relevant to the performance of the judicial
function, not whether they were relied upon 36 Indeed, decision-
makers often find that a great deal of relevant material does not
ultimately sway their decision. And insofar as the District Court held
that privacy interests outweigh the presumption of public access in
each of the thousands of pages at issue, that decision - which appears
to have been made without particularized review -amounts to an
abuse of discretion.37
In light of the District Court's failure to conduct an
individualized review of the sealed materials, it is necessary to do so
now. We believe the District Court is best situated to conduct this
review. The District Court can directly communicate with the parties,
and can therefore more swiftly and thoroughly consider particular
objections to unsealing specific materials. Relatedly, the District Court
can obtain the parties' assistance in effecting any necessary redactions,
and in notifying any outside parties whose privacy interests might be
36 See text accompanying notes 12-18 and 26-28, ante.
37 See In re City of New York, 607 F.3d 923, 943 n.21 (2d Cir. 2010) (explaining
that "abuse of discretion" is a nonpejorative, legal "term of art").
18


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page19 of 25
implicated by the unsealing. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the
District Court to conduct such a particularized review and unseal all
documents for which the presumption of public access outweighs any
countervailing privacy interests.
D. Protecting the Integrity of Judicial Proceedings
While we disagree with the District Court's disposition of the
motions to unseal, we share its concern that court files might be used
to "promote scandal arising out of unproven potentially libelous
statements."38 We therefore describe certain methods courts can
employ to protect the judicial process from being coopted for such
purposes.
The Supreme Court has explained that "le]very court has
supervisory power over its own records and files" to ensure they "are
not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal" or "serve
as reservoirs of libelous statements for press consumption. 39 This
supervisory function is not only within a district court's power, but
also among its responsibilities.
In practice, district courts may employ several methods to fulfill
this function. They may, for instance, issue protective orders
forbidding dissemination of certain material "to protect a party or
person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue

burden" and require that filings containing such material be submitted
under seal. 40 If parties then seek to file such materials, the court may
deny them leave to do so.41 District courts may also seek to counteract
the effect of defamatory statements by explaining on the record that
the statements appear to lack credibility. Moreover, under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), the district court may strike such
material from the filings on the grounds that it is "redundant,
immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous."42 Because such rejected or
stricken material is not "relevant to the performance of the judicial
function" it would not be considered a "judicial document" and would
enjoy no presumption of public access.43 Finally, in appropriate

"on its own" or "on motion made by a party." Id. Although motions to strike
material solely "on the ground that the matter is impertinent and immaterial" are
disfavored, when material is also "scandalous," no such presumption applies. Cf.

circumstances, district courts may impose sanctions on attorneys and
parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c). 44
E. A Cautionary Note
We conclude with a note of caution to the public regarding the
reliability of court filings such as those unsealed today.
Materials submitted by parties to a court should be understood
for what they are. They do not reflect the court's own findings. Rather,
they are prepared by parties seeking to advance their own interests in
an adversarial process. Although affidavits and depositions are
offered "under penalty of perjury," it is in fact exceedingly rare for
anyone to be prosecuted for perjury in a civil proceeding. 5 Similarly,
44 In relevant part, Rule 11 provides:
By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper ... an
attorney or unrepresented party certifies that ... it is not being presented
for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or
needlessly increase the cost of litigation .... [T]he court may impose an
appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the
rule or is responsible for the violation .... The sanction may include
nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed
on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing
payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and
other expenses directly resulting from the violation.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. See also Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1049 (describing sanctions available
to the court).

Politics: A Modern Approach, 30 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 35, 47 n.52 (1996) ("Perjury cases
are not often pursued ....").
21


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page22 of 25
pleadings, complaints, and briefs-while supposedly based on
underlying evidentiary material — can be misleading. Such documents
sometimes draw dubious inferences from already questionable
material or present ambiguous material as definitive.
Moreover, court filings are, in some respects, particularly
susceptible to fraud. For while the threat of defamation actions may
deter malicious falsehoods in standard publications, this threat is non-
existent with respect to certain court filings. This is so because, under
New York law (which governs the underlying defamation claim here),
"absolute immunity from liability for defamation exists for oral or
written statements made ... in connection with a proceeding before a
court."46 Thus, although the act of filing a document with a court might
be thought to lend that document additional credibility, in fact,
allegations appearing in such documents might be less credible than
those published elsewhere.47
46 Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 718 (2015); see also Kelly v. Albarino, 485
F.3d 664, 666 (2d Cir. 2007) (adopting the reasoning of the District Court explaining
that this privilege is "the broadest of possible privileges"); Restatement (Second) of
Torts § 587 (1977) ("A party to a private litigation or a private prosecutor or
defendant in a criminal prosecution is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory
matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial
proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course and as a part of, a judicial
proceeding in which he participates, if the matter has some relation to the
proceeding."). But see note 47, post.
47 While common law courts have generally interpreted the litigation privilege
broadly, they nevertheless maintain an important (if rarely implemented)
limitation on its scope: to qualify for the privilege, a statement must be "material
and pertinent to the questions involved." Front, 24 N.Y.3d at 718 (quoting Youmans
22


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page23 of 25
We have long noted that the press plays a vital role in ensuring
the public right of access and in enhancing "the quality and safeguards
the integrity of the factfinding process."4s When faithfully observing
its best traditions, the print and electronic media "contributes to public
understanding of the rule of law" and "validates [its] claim of
functioning as surrogates for the public. "49
At the same time, the media does the public a profound
disservice when it reports on parties' allegations uncritically. We have
previously observed that courts cannot possibly "discredit every
statement or document turned up in the course of litigation," and we
have criticized "the use by the media of the somewhat misleading term
'court records' in referring to such items."50 Even ordinarily critical
v. Smith, 153 N.Y. 214, 219-20 (1897)). It follows, then, that immaterial and
impertinent statements are (at least nominally) actionable, particularly when they
are "so needlessly defamatory as to warrant the inference of express malice." Id.
(same). It seems to us that when a district court strikes statements from the record
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) on the ground that the matter is "impertinent" and
"immaterial," it makes the very same determination that permits a defamation
action under the common law. We think the judicial system would be well served
were our common law courts to revitalize this crucial qualification to the litigation
privilege.

readers may take the reference to "court papers" as some sort of
marker of reliability. This would be a mistake.
We therefore urge the media to exercise restraint in covering
potentially defamatory allegations, and we caution the public to read
such accounts with discernment.
III. CONCLUSION
To summarize, we hold as follows:
(1) Materials submitted in connection with a motion for
summary judgment are subject to a strong presumption of
public access.
(2) The summary judgment record at issue will be unsealed
upon issuance of our mandate, subject to minimal
redactions.51
(3) Materials submitted in connection with, and relevant to,
discovery motions, motions in limine, and other non-
dispositive motions are subject to a lesser-but still
substantial — presumption of public access.
(4) The District Court is directed to review the remaining sealed
materials individually and
unseal those materials
as
appropriate.
51 See note 22, ante.
24


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page25 of 25
(5) District courts should exercise the full range of their
substantial powers to ensure their files do not become
vehicles for defamation.
For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the orders of the
District Court entered on November 2, 2016, May 3, 2017, and August
27, 2018, ORDER the unsealing of the summary judgment record as
described herein, and REMAND the cause to the District Court for
particularized review of the remaining materials.
In undertaking this task, the District Court may be well-served
by ordering the parties to submit to the Court unredacted, electronic
copies of the remaining sealed materials, as well as specific, proposed
redactions. The District Court may also order the parties to identify
and notify additional parties whose privacy interests would likely be
implicated by disclosure of these materials.
In the interests of judicial economy, any future appeal in this
matter shall be referred to this panel.

POOLER, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:
I join the Court's opinion in every respect but one: the decision to unseal
the summary judgment record ourselves. I agree that all or most of the material
must be unsealed. Nevertheless, in my view, the district court is better suited to
the task. As the Court's opinion recognizes in connection with the remaining
sealed materials, the district court is better positioned to communicate with the
parties and any nonparties whose privacy interests might be affected by
unsealing. On that score, it is worth clarifying here the breadth of the Court's
unsealing order: it unseals nearly 2000 pages of material. The task of identifying
and making specific redactions in such a substantial volume is perilous; the
consequences of even a seemingly minor error may be grave and are irrevocable.
Moreover, although I share the majority's concern about avoiding delay, I would
alleviate that concern through other means — perhaps with an order directing the
district court to act expeditiously and by making clear what types of limited
redactions are and are not appropriate. In sum, I would unseal the district court's
summary judgment decision only and leave the remainder of the materials for
the district court to review, redact, and unseal on remand.

Pursuant to Rule 56.1 of the Local Civil Rules of this Court, defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell submits this statement of the material facts as to which she contends there is no genuine

the evidence cited herein and in the accompanying memoranda of law and does not waive any
objections by making this submission.
numbered.
1. Ms. Maxwell's response to publications of plaintiff's false allegations: the
March 2011 statement. In early 2011 plaintiff in two British tabloid interviews made numerous
false and defamatory allegations against Ms. Maxwell. In the articles, plaintiff made no direct
allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in any improper conduct with Jeffrey Epstein, who
had pleaded guilty in 2007 to procuring a minor for prostitution. Nonetheless, plaintiff suggested
that Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein and may have known about the crime for which he was
convicted.
2. In the articles, plaintiff alleged she had sex with Prince Andrew, "a well-known
businessman," a "world-renowned scientist," a "respected liberal politician," and a "foreign head
of state."
3. In response to the allegations Ms. Maxwell's British attorney, working with
Mr. Gow, issued a statement on March 9, 2011, denying "the various allegations about
[Ms. Maxwell] that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false."

It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal representatives to
certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be
withdrawn have simply been ignored.
In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against
those newspapers.
"I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain
newspapers live by the adage, "why let the truth get in the way of a good story."
However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and
I ask that they stop," said Ghislaine Maxwell.
"A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their
reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation
or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name," she said.

5. Plaintiff's gratuitous and "lurid" accusations in an unrelated action. In 2008 two
alleged victims of Epstein brought an action under the Crime Victims' Rights Act against the
United States government purporting to challenge Epstein's plea agreement. They alleged the
government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the agreement.
6.
Seven years later, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA
action, claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January 1, 2015,
Ms. Giuffre filed a "corrected" joinder motion.
7. The issue presented in her joinder motion was narrow: whether she should be
permitted to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21,
specifically, whether she was a "known victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed them
CVRA duties." Yet, "the bulk of the [motion] consists of copious factual details that [plaintiff]
and [her co-movant] 'would prove ... if allowed to join. " Ms. Giuffre gratuitously included
2


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page4 of 18
provocative and "lurid details" of her alleged sexual activities as an alleged victim of sexual
trafficking.
8. At the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew that the media
had been following the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately filed
the motion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre's name, claiming the need for privacy and secrecy,
they made no attempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they filed the motion
publicly.
9. As the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre "name[d]
several individuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they
took place." The court ruled that "these lurid details are unnecessary": "The factual details
regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and
impertinent.., especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related
to the respondent Government." Accordingly, "[t]hese unnecessary details shall be stricken." Id.
The court then struck all Ms. Giuffre's factual allegations relating to her alleged sexual activities
and her allegations of misconduct by non-parties. The court said the striking of the "lurid details"
was a sanction for Ms. Giuffre's improper inclusion of them in the motion.
10. The district court found not only that the "lurid details" were unnecessary but also
that the entire joinder motion was "entirely unnecessary." Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew the
motion with all its "lurid details" was unnecessary because the motion itself recognized that she
would be able to participate as a fact witness to achieve the same result she sought as a party.
The court denied plaintiff's joinder motion.
11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre "named" repeatedly in the joinder motion was
Ms. Maxwell. According to the "lurid details" of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion,
3


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page5 of 18
Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a "sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme" created by
Epstein:
•
Ms. Maxwell "approached" plaintiff in 1999 when plaintiff was "fifteen years
old" to recruit her into the scheme.
• Ms. Maxwell was "one of the main women" Epstein used to "procure under-
aged girls for sexual activities."
• Ms. Maxwell was a "primary co-conspirator" with Epstein in his scheme.
• She "persuaded" plaintiff to go to Epstein's mansion "in a fashion very similar
to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of
other children."
• At the mansion, when plaintiff began giving Epstein a massage, he and
Ms. Maxwell "turned it into a sexual encounter."
• Epstein "with the assistance of" Ms. Maxwell "converted [plaintiff] into ... a
'sex slave.'" Id. Plaintiff was a "sex slave" from "about 1999 through 2002."
• Ms. Maxwell also was a "co-conspirator in Epstein's sexual abuse."
• Ms. Maxwell "appreciated the immunity" she acquired under Epstein's plea
agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution "for the crimes
she committed in Florida."
• Ms. Maxwell "participat|ed] in the sexual abuse of [plaintiff] and others."
• Ms. Maxwell "took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls
involved in sexual activities, including [plaintiff]." Id. She shared the photos
with Epstein.
• As part of her "role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring," Ms. Maxwell "connected]"
Epstein with "powerful individuals" so that Epstein could traffick plaintiff to
these persons.
Plaintiff was "forced to have sexual relations" with Prince Andrew in
"[Ms. Maxwell's] apartment" in London. Ms. Maxwell "facilitated" plaintiff's
sex with Prince Andrew "by acting as a 'madame' for Epstein."
• Ms. Maxwell "assist[ed] in internationally trafficking" plaintiff and "numerous
other young girls for sexual purposes."
Plaintiff was "forced" to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others "engage in
illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls."
4


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page6 of 18
12. In the joinder motion, plaintiff also alleged she was "forced" to have sex with
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, "model scout" Jean Luc Brunel, and "many other
powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business
executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders."
13. Plaintiff said after serving for four years as a "sex slave," she "managed to escape to
a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years."
14. Plaintiff suggested the government was part of Epstein's "conspiracy" when it
"secretly" negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Eptstein precluding federal prosecution
of Epstein and his "co-conspirators." The government's secrecy, plaintiff alleged, was motivated
by its fear that plaintiff would raise "powerful objections" to the agreement that would have
"shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other powerful individuals.
15. Notably, the other "Jane Doe" who joined plaintiff's motion who alleged she was
sexually abused "many occasions" by Epstein was unable to corroborate any of plaintiff's
allegations.
16. Also notably, in her multiple and lengthy consensual interviews with Ms. Churcher
three years earlier, plaintiff told Ms. Churcher of virtually none of the details she described in the
joinder motion.
17.
Ms. Maxwell's response to plaintiff's "lurid" accusations: the January 2015
statement. As plaintiff and her lawyers expected, before District Judge Marra in the CVRA
action could strike the "lurid details" of plaintiff's allegations in the joinder motion, members of
the media obtained copies of the motion.
18.
At Mr. Barden's direction, on January 3, 2015, Mr. Gow sent to numerous
representatives of British media organizations an email containing "a quotable statement on
5


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page7 of 18
behalf of Ms Maxwell." The email was sent to more than 6 and probably less than 30 media
representatives. It was not sent to non-media representatives.
19. Among the media representatives were Martin Robinson of the Daily Mail; P.
Peachey of The Independent; Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror; David Brown of The Times; and
Nick Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC; and David Mercer of the Press Association. These
representatives were selected based on their request—after the joinder motion was filed for a
response from Ms. Maxwell to plaintiff's allegations in the motion.
20. The email to the media members read:
To Whom It May Concern,
Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell.
No further communication will be provided by her on this matter.
Thanks for your understanding.

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts—so not a new individual. The allegations made by
Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about
public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that
Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he
denies.
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not
publicised as news, as they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains
the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which
have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek
redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.
21. Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend it as a
traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media. So he intentionally did
not pass it through a public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow's firm, Acuity Reputation.
6


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page8 of 18
22. The January 2015 statement served two purposes. First, Mr. Barden intended that it
mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's reputation from the press's republication of plaintiff's false
allegations. He believed these ends could be accomplished by suggesting to the media that,
among other things, they should subject plaintiff's allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. For
example, he noted in the statement that plaintiff's allegations changed dramatically over time,
suggesting that they are "obvious lies" and therefore should not be "publicised as news."
23. Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be "a shot across the
bow" of the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations
without conducting any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly noted
that plaintiff's allegations were "defamatory." In this sense, the statement was intended as a
cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the
seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false
allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct.
24. Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow's emails prefaced the statement with
the following language: "Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell"
(emphasis supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-time-only, comprehensive
response quoted in full-to plaintiff's December 30, 2014, allegations that would give the
media Ms. Maxwell's response. The purpose of the prefatory statement was to inform the media-
recipients of this intent.
25. Plaintiff's activities to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
Plaintiff has engaged in numerous activities to bring attention to herself, to the prosecution and
punishment of wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest of bringing light
to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
7


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page9 of 18
26. Plaintiff created an organization, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida corporation,
directly related to her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse.
27. The "goal" of Victims Refuse Silence "was, and continues to be, to help survivors
surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse."
Toward this end, plaintiff has "dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex
trafficking."
28. Plaintiff repeatedly has sought out media organizations to discuss her alleged
experience as a victim of sexual abuse.
29. On December 30, 2014, plaintiff publicly filed an "entirely unnecessary" joinder
motion laden with "unnecessary," "lurid details" about being "sexually abused" as a "minor
victim[]" by wealthy and famous men and being "trafficked" all around the world as a "sex
slave."
30. The plaintiff's alleged purpose in filing the joinder motion was to "vindicate" her
rights under the CVRA, expose the government's "secretly negotiated" "non-prosecution
agreement" with Epstein, "shed tremendous public light" on Epstein and "other powerful
individuals" that would undermine the agreement, and support the CVRA plaintiffs' request for
documents that would show how Epstein "used his powerful political and social connections to
secure a favorable plea deal" and the government's "motive" to aid Epstein and his "co-
conspirators."
31. Plaintiff has written the manuscript of a book she has been trying to publish detailing
her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse and of sex trafficking in Epstein's alleged "sex
scheme."
8


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page10 of 18
32. Republication alleged by plaintiff. Plaintiff was required by Interrogatory No. 6 to
identify any false statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell that were 'published globally, including
within the Southern District of New York,'" as plaintiff alleged in Paragraph 9 of Count I of her
complaint. In response, plaintiff identified the January 2015 statement and nine instances in
which various news media published portions of the January 2015 statement in news articles or
broadcast stories.
33. In none of the nine instances was there any publication of the entire January 2015
statement.
34. Ms. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or authority over any media
organization, including the media identified in plaintiff's response to Interrogatory No. 6, in
connection with the media's publication of portions of the January 2015 statement.
35. Plaintiff's defamation action against Ms. Maxwell. Eight years after Epstein's
guilty plea, plaintiff brought this action, repeating many of the allegations she made in her
CVRA joinder motion.
36. The complaint alleged that the January 2015 statement "contained the following
deliberate falsehoods":
(a) That Giuffre's sworn allegations "against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue."
(b) That the allegations have been "shown to be untrue."
(c) That Giuffre's "claims are obvious lies."
37. Plaintiff lived independently from her parents with her fiancé long before
meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. After leaving the Growing Together drug rehabilitation
facility in 1999, plaintiff moved in with the family of a fellow patient. There she met, and
became engaged to, her friend's brother, James Michael Austrich. She and Austrich thereafter


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page11 of 18
rented an apartment in the Ft. Lauderdale area with another friend and both worked at various
jobs in that area. Later, they stayed briefly with plaintiff's parents in the Palm Beach/
Loxahatchee, Florida area before Austrich rented an apartment for the couple on Bent Oak Drive
in Royal Palm Beach. Although plaintiff agreed to marry Austrich, she never had any intention
of doing so.
38. Plaintiff re-enrolled in high school from June 21, 2000 until March 7, 2002.
After finishing the 9* grade school year at Forest Hills High School on June 9, 1999, plaintiff re-
enrolled at Wellington Adult High School on June 21, 2000, again on August 16, 2000 and on
August 14, 2001. On September 20, 2001, Plaintiff then enrolled at Royal Palm Beach High
School. A few weeks later, on October 12, 2001, she matriculated at Survivors Charter School.
Id. Survivor's Charter School was an alternative school designed to assist students who had been
unsuccessful at more traditional schools. Plaintiff remained enrolled at Survivor's Charter School
until March 7, 2002. She was present 56 days and absent 13 days during her time there. Id.
Plaintiff never received her high school diploma or GED. Plaintiff and Figueroa went "back to
school" together at Survivor's Charter School. The school day there lasted from morning until
early afternoon.
39. During the year 2000, plaintiff worked at numerous jobs. In 2000, while living
with her fiancé, plaintiff held five different jobs: at Aviculture Breeding and Research Center,
Southeast Employee Management Company, The Club at Mar-a-Lago, Oasis Outsourcing, and
Neiman Marcus. Her taxable earnings that year totaled nearly $9,000. Plaintiff cannot now recall
either the Southeast Employee Management Company or the Oasis Outsourcing jobs.
40. Plaintiff's employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2000. Plaintiff's
father, Sky Roberts, was hired as a maintenance worker at the The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm
10


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page12 of 18
Beach, Florida, beginning on April 11, 2000. Mr. Roberts worked there year-round for
approximately 3 years. After working there for a period of time, Mr. Roberts became acquainted
with the head of the spa area and recommended plaintiff for a job there. Mar-a-Lago closes every
Mother's Day and reopens on November 1. Most of employees Mar-a-Lago, including all
employees of the spa area such as "spa attendants," are "seasonal" and work only when the club
is open, i.e., between November 1 and Mother's Day. Plaintiff was hired as a "seasonal" spa
attendant to work at the Mar-a-Lago Club in the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17.
41. Plaintiff represented herself as a masseuse for Jeffrey Epstein. While working at
the Mar-a-Lago spa and reading a library book about massage, plaintiff met Ms. Maxwell.
Plaintiff thereafter told her father that she got a job working for Jeffrey Epstein as a masseuse.
Plaintiff's father took her to Epstein's house on one occasion around that time, and Epstein came
outside and introduced himself to Mr. Roberts. Plaintiff commenced employment as a traveling
masseuse for Mr. Epstein. Plaintiff was excited about her job as a masseuse, about traveling
with him and about meeting famous people. Plaintiff represented that she was employed as a
masseuse beginning in January 2001. Plaintiff never mentioned Ms. Maxwell to her then-fiancé,
Austrich. Plaintiff's father never met Ms. Maxwell.
42. Plaintiff resumed her relationship with convicted felon Anthony Figueroa. In
spring 2001, while living with Austich, plaintiff lied to and cheated on him with her high school
boyfriend, Anthony Figueroa. Plaintiff and Austrich thereafter broke up, and Figueroa moved
into the Bent Oak apartment with plaintiff. When Austrich returned to the Bent Oak apartment to
check on his pets and retrieve his belongings, Figueroa in Plaintiff's presence punched Austrich
in the face. Figueroa and plaintiff fled the scene before police arrived. Figueroa was then a
convicted felon and a drug abuser on probation for possession of a controlled substance.


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page13 of 18
43. Plaintiff freely and voluntarily contacted the police to come to her aid in 2001
and 2002 but never reported to them that she was Epstein's "sex slave." In August 2001 at
age 17, while living in the same apartment, plaintiff and Figueroa hosted a party with a number
of guests. During the party, according to plaintiff, someone entered plaintiff's room and stole
$500 from her shirt pocket. Plaintiff contacted the police. She met and spoke with police officers
regarding the incident and filed a report. She did not disclose to the officer that she was a "sex
slave." A second time, in June 2002, plaintiff contacted the police to report that her former
landlord had left her belongings by the roadside and had lit her mattress on fire. Again, plaintiff
met and spoke with the law enforcement officers but did not complain that she was the victim of
any sexual trafficking or abuse or that she was then being held as a "sex slave."
44. From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein and Maxwell were almost
entirely absent from Florida on documented travel unaccompanied by Plaintiff. Flight logs
maintained by Epstein's private pilot Dave Rodgers evidence the substantial number of trips
away from Florida that Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Plaintiff, between August
2001 and September 2002. Rodgers maintained a log of all flights on which Epstein and
Maxwell traveled with him. Epstein additionally traveled with another pilot who did not keep
such logs and he also occasionally traveled via commercial flights. For substantially all of
thirteen months of the twenty-two months (from November 2000 until September 2002) that
Plaintiff lived in Palm Beach and knew Epstein, Epstein was traveling outside of Florida
unaccompanied by Plaintiff. During this same period of time, Plaintiff was employed at various
jobs, enrolled in school, and living with her boyfriend.
45. Plaintiff and Figueroa shared a vehicle during 2001 and 2002. Plaintiff and
Figueroa shared a '93 white Pontiac in 2001 and 2002. Plaintiff freely traveled around the Palm
12


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page14 of 18
Beach area in that vehicle. In August 2002, Plaintiff acquired a Dodge Dakota pickup truck from
her father. Figueroa used that vehicle in a series of crimes before and after Plaintiff left for
Thailand.
46. Plaintiff held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002. During 2001 and 2002, plaintiff
was gainfully employed at several jobs. She worked as a waitress at Mannino's Restaurant, at
TGIFriday's restaurant (aka CCI of Royal Palm Inc.), and at Roadhouse Grill. She also was
employed at Courtyard Animal Hospital (aka Marc Pinkwasser DVM).
47. In September 2002, Plaintiff traveled to Thailand to receive massage training
and while there, met her future husband and eloped with him. Plaintiff traveled to Thailand
in September 2002 to receive formal training as a masseuse. Figueroa drove her to the airport.
While there, she initially contacted Figueroa frequently, incurring a phone bill of $4,000. She
met Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and decided to marry him. She thereafter ceased all contact
with Figueroa from October 2002 until two days before Mr. Figueroa's deposition in this matter
in May 2016.
48. Detective Recarey's investigation of Epstein failed to uncover any evidence that
Ms. Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or
possession of child pornography. Joseph Recarey served as the lead detective from the Palm
Beach Police Department charged with investigating Jeffrey Epstein. That investigation
commenced in 2005. Recarey worked only on the Epstein case for an entire year. He reviewed
previous officers' reports and interviews, conducted numerous interviews of witnesses and
alleged victims himself, reviewed surveillance footage of the Epstein home, participated in and
had knowledge of the search warrant executed on the Epstein home, and testified regarding the
case before the Florida state grand jury against Epstein. Detective Recarey's investigation
13


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page15 of 18
revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever mentioned Ms. Maxwell's name and she
was never considered a suspect by the government. None of Epstein's alleged victims said they
had seen Ms. Maxwell at Epstein's house, nor said they had been "recruited by her," nor paid
any money by her, nor told what to wear or how to act by her. Indeed, none of Epstein's alleged
victims ever reported to the government they had met or spoken to Ms. Maxwell. Maxwell was
not seen coming or going from the house during the law enforcement surveillance of Epstein's
home. The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell and her name was never mentioned
before the grand jury. No property belonging to Maxwell, including "sex toys" or "child
pornography," was seized from Epstein's home during execution of the search warrant. Detective
Recarey, when asked to describe "everything that you believe you know about Ghislaine
Maxwell's sexual trafficking conduct," replied, "I don't." He confirmed he has no knowledge
about Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking anybody. Detective Recarey also has no knowledge of
Plaintiff's conduct that is subject of this lawsuit.
49. No nude photograph of Plaintiff was displayed in Epstein's home. Epstein's
housekeeper, Juan Alessi, "never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. Epstein's
house." Detective Recarey entered Epstein's home in 2002 to install security cameras to catch a
thief and did not observe any "child pornography" within the home, including on Epstein's desk
in his office.
50.
Plaintiff intentionally destroyed her "journal" and "dream journal" regarding
her "memories" of this case in 2013 while represented by counsel. Plaintiff drafted a
"journal" describing individuals to whom she claims she was sexually trafficked as well as her
memories and thoughts about her experiences with Epstein. In 2013, she and her husband created
a bonfire in her backyard in Florida and burned the journal together with other documents in her
14


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page16 of 18
possession. Id. Plaintiff also kept a "dream journal" regarding her thoughts and memories that
she possessed in January 2016. To date, Plaintiff cannot locate the "dream journal."
51. Plaintiff publicly peddled her story beginning in 2011. Plaintiff granted journalist
Sharon Churcher extensive interviews that resulted in seven (7) widely distributed articles from
March 2011 through January 2015. Churcher regularly communicated with plaintiff and her
"attorneys or other agents" from "early 2011" to "the present day." Plaintiff received
approximately $160,000 for her stories and pictures that were published by many news
organizations.
52. Plaintiff drafted a 144-page purportedly autobiographical book manuscript in
2011 which she actively sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous with her Churcher
interviews, plaintiff drafted a book manuscript which purported to document plaintiff's
experiences as a teenager in Florida, including her interactions with Epstein and Maxwell.
Plaintiff communicated with literary agents, ghost writers and potential independent publishers
in an effort to get her book published. She generated marketing materials and circulated those
along with book chapters to numerous individuals associated with publishing and the media.
53. Plaintiff's publicly filed "lurid" CVRA pleadings initiated a media frenzy and
generated highly publicized litigation between her lawyers and Alan Dershowitz. On
December 30, 2014, plaintiff, through counsel, publicly filed a joinder motion that contained her
"lurid allegations" about Ms. Maxwell and many others, including Alan Dershowitz, Prince
Andrew, Jean-Luc Brunel. The joinder motion was followed by a "corrected" motion and two
further declarations in January and February 2015, which repeated many of plaintiff's claims.
These CVRA pleadings generated a media maelstrom and spawned highly publicized litigation
between plaintiff's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz. After plaintiff publicly
15


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page17 of 18
alleged Mr. Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz vigorously defended himself in
the media. He called plaintiff a liar and accused her lawyers of unethical conduct. In response,
attorneys Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz who counterclaimed. This litigation, in turn,
caused additional media attention by national and international media organizations.
54. Plaintiff formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to attract publicity and
speak out on a public controversy. In 2014, plaintiff, with the assistance of the same counsel,
formed a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to plaintiff, the purpose of
the organization is to promote plaintiff's professed cause against sex slavery. The stated goal of
her organization is to help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically
experienced by victims of sexual abuse. Plaintiff attempts to promote Victims Refuse Silence at
every opportunity. For example, plaintiff participated in an interview in New York with ABC to
promote the charity and to get her mission out to the public.

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 for
summary judgment.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
FACTS
The following facts are undisputed. Additional undisputed facts are set forth in specific
argument sections. All paragraphs containing undisputed facts will be sequentially numbered.
1. Ms. Maxwell's response to publications of plaintiff's false allegations: the
March 2011 statement. In early 2011 plaintiff in two British tabloid interviews made numerous
false and defamatory allegations against Ms. Maxwell. ExHIBITS A-B.' In the articles, plaintiff
made no direct allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in any improper conduct with Jeffrey
Epstein, who had pleaded guilty in 2007 to procuring a minor for prostitution.? Nonetheless,
plaintiff suggested that Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein and may have known about the crime
for which he was convicted. See generally EXHIBITS A-B.
2. In the articles, plaintiff alleged she had sex with Prince Andrew, "a well-known
businessman,"
'a "world-renowned scientist," a "respected liberal politician," and a "foreign head
of state." Id. at 5.
3.
In response to the allegations Ms. Maxwell's British attorney, working with
Mr. Gow, issued a statement on March 9, 2011, denying "the various allegations about
[Ms. Maxwell] that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false."
ЕХнІвІт С.
4. The statement read in full:
'The articles were attached as exhibits to the author Sharon Churcher's declaration in
support of her motion to quash an SDT issued to her. See Doc.216-2 & 216-3.
'Doc. 1 99 11, 14.

Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell
By Devonshires Solicitors, PRNE
Wednesday, March 9, 2011
London, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about
her that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely
false.
It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal representatives to
certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be
withdrawn have simply been ignored.
In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against
those newspapers.
"I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain
newspapers live by the adage, "why let the truth get in the way of a good story."
However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and
I ask that they stop," said Ghislaine Maxwell.
"A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their
reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation
or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name," she said

ExHIBIT C (emphasis supplied; capitalization altered). We refer to this as "the March 2011
statement."
5. Plaintiff's gratuitous and "lurid" accusations in an unrelated action. In 2008 two
alleged victims of Epstein brought an action under the Crime Victims' Rights Act against the
United States government purporting to challenge Epstein's plea agreement. They alleged the
government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the agreement. See EXHIBIT D, at 2.
2


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page10 of 77
6. Seven years later, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA
action, claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January 1, 2015,
Ms. Giuffre filed a "corrected" joinder motion. EXHIBIT D, at 1, 9.
7. The issue presented in her joinder motion was narrow: whether she should be
permitted to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21,
specifically, whether she was a "known victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed them
CVRA duties," EXHIBIT E, at 5. Yet, the court noted, "the bulk of the [motion] consists of
copious factual details that [plaintiff] and [her co-movant] 'would prove ... if allowed to join.""
Id. (brackets omitted). Ms. Giuffre gratuitously included provocative and "lurid details" of her
alleged sexual activities as an alleged victim of sexual trafficking. Id.
8. At the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew that the media
had been following the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately filed
the motion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre's name, claiming the need for privacy and secrecy,
they made no attempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they filed the motion
publicly. EXHIBIT D, at 1 & n.1.
9. As the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre "name[d]
several individuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they
took place." EXHIBIT E, at 5. The court ruled that "these lurid details are unnecessary": 'The
factual details regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are
immaterial and impertinent..., especially considering that these details involve non-parties who
are not related to the respondent Government." Id. Accordingly, "It]hese unnecessary details
shall be stricken." Id. The court then struck all Ms. Giuffre's factual allegations relating to her
alleged sexual activities and her allegations of misconduct by non-parties. Id. at 5-6. The court
3


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page11 of 77
said the striking of the "lurid details" was a sanction for Ms. Giuffre's improper inclusion of
them in the motion. See id. at 6-7.
10. The district court found not only that the "lurid details" were unnecessary but also
that the entire joinder motion was "entirely unnecessary," id. at 7. Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers
knew the motion with all its "lurid details" was unnecessary because, as the court pointed out,
the motion itself recognized that she would be able to participate as a fact witness to achieve the
same result she sought as a party. See id. at 7-8; see also id. at 8 (noting that in the motion, Ms.
Giuffre's lawyers said that "regardless of whether this Court grants the ... Motion, 'they will
call [her] as a witness at any trial'"). The court denied plaintiff's joinder motion. Id. at 10.
11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre "named" repeatedly in the joinder motion was
Ms. Maxwell. EXHIBIT D, at 3-6. According to the "lurid details" of Ms. Giuffre included in the
motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a "sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme"
created by Epstein:
• Ms. Maxwell "approached" plaintiff in 1999 when plaintiff was "fifteen years
old" to recruit her into the scheme. Id. at 3.
• Ms. Maxwell was "one of the main women" Epstein used to "procure under-
aged girls for sexual activities." Id.
• Ms. Maxwell was a "primary co-conspirator" with Epstein in his scheme. Id.
• She "persuaded" plaintiff to go to Epstein's mansion "in a fashion very similar
to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of
other children." Id.
• At the mansion, when plaintiff began giving Epstein a massage, he and
Ms. Maxwell "turned it into a sexual encounter." Id.
• Epstein "with the assistance of" Ms. Maxwell "converted [plaintiff] into... a
"sex slave. " Id. Plaintiff was a "sex slave" from "about 1999 through 2002." Id.
• Ms. Maxwell also was a "co-conspirator in Epstein's sexual abuse." Id. at 4.
4


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page12 of 77
• Ms. Maxwell "appreciated the immunity" she acquired under Epstein's plea
agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution "for the crimes
she committed in Florida." Id.
• Ms. Maxwell "participat[ed] in the sexual abuse of [plaintiff] and others." Id.
• Ms. Maxwell "took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls
involved in sexual activities, including [plaintiff]." Id. She shared the photos
with Epstein. Id.
• As part of her "role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring," Ms. Maxwell "connect[ed]"
Epstein with "powerful individuals" so that Epstein could traffick plaintiff to
these persons. Id.
•
Plaintiff was "forced to have sexual relations" with Prince Andrew in
"[Ms. Maxwell's] apartment" in London. Id. Ms. Maxwell "facilitated"
plaintiff's sex with Prince Andrew "by acting as a 'madame' for Epstein." Id.
Ms. Maxwell "assisted] in internationally trafficking" plaintiff and "numerous
other young girls for sexual purposes." Id.
Plaintiff was "forced" to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others "engage in
illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls." Id.
12. In the joinder motion, plaintiff also alleged she was "forced" to have sex with
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, "model scout" Jean Luc Brunel, and "many other
powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business
executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders." Id. at 4-6.
13.
Plaintiff said after serving for four years as a "sex slave," she "managed to escape to
a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years." Id. at 3.
14.
Plaintiff suggested the government was part of Epstein's "conspiracy" when it
"secretly" negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding federal prosecution
of Epstein and his "co-conspirators." Id. at 6. The government's secrecy, plaintiff alleged, was
motivated by its fear that plaintiff would raise "powerful objections" to the agreement that would
have "shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other powerful individuals. Id. at 6-7.
5


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page13 of 77
15. Notably, the other "Jane Doe" who joined plaintiff's motion who alleged she was
sexually abused "many occasions" by Epstein was unable to corroborate any of plaintiff's
allegations. See id. at 7-8.
16. Also notably, in her multiple and lengthy consensual interviews with Ms. Churcher
three years earlier, plaintiff told Ms. Churcher virtually none of the details she described in the
joinder motion. See EXHIBIT A-B.
17. Ms. Maxwell's response to plaintiff's "lurid" accusations: the January 2015
statement. As plaintiff and her lawyers expected, before District Judge Marra in the CVRA
action could strike the "lurid details" of plaintiff's allegations in the joinder motion, members of
the media obtained copies of the motion. See EXHIBIT G, at 31:2-36:4 & Depo.Exs.3-4.
18. At Mr. Barden's direction, on January 2, 2015, Mr. Gow sent to numerous
representatives of British media organizations an email containing "a quotable statement on
behalf of Ms Maxwell." ExHIBIT F; ExHIBIT G, at 33:8-23. The email was sent to more than 6
and probably less than 30 media representatives. See EXHIBIT G, at 33:8-34:3. It was not sent to
non-media representatives. See id. at 31:2-35:21.
19. Among the media representatives were Martin Robinson of the Daily Mail; P.
Peachey of The Independent; Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror; David Brown of The Times; and
Nick Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC; and David Mercer of the Press Association. See,
e.g., EXHIBIT F. These representatives were selected based on their request—after the joinder
motion was filedfor a response from Ms. Maxwell to plaintiff's allegations in the motion. See,
e.g., EXHIBIT G, at 30:23-35:21 & Depo.Ex.3.
20. The email to the media members read:
To Whom It May Concern,
Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell.

ACUITY Reputation
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts-
-so not a new individual. The allegations made by
Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about
public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that
Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he
denies.
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not
publicised as news, as they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains
the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which
have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek
redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.
ExHIBIT F (emphasis supplied). We refer to this email as "the January 2015 statement."
21. Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend it as a
traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media. So he intentionally did
engage a public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow's firm Acuity Reputation, to prepare the
statement. See EXHIBIT K 19 10,15.
22. The January 2015 statement served two purposes. First, Mr. Barden intended that it
mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's reputation from the press's republication of plaintiff's false
allegations. He believed this could be accomplished by suggesting to the media that, among other
things, they should subject plaintiff's allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. For example, he noted
in the statement that plaintiff's allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they
are "obvious lies" and therefore should not be "publicised as news." Id. T 11.
7


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page15 of 77
23. Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be "a shot across the
bow" of the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations
without conducting any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly noted
that plaintiff's allegations were "defamatory." In this sense, the statement was intended as a
cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the
seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false
allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. Id. 9 17.
24. Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow's emails prefaced the statement with
the following language: "Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell"
(emphasis supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-time-only, comprehensive
response quoted in full-to plaintiff's December 30, 2014, allegations that would give the
media Ms. Maxwell's response. Id. 9 19. The purpose of the prefatory statement was to inform
the media-recipients of this intent. Id.
25. Plaintiff's activities to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
Plaintiff has engaged in numerous activities to bring attention to herself, to the prosecution and
punishment of wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest of bringing light
to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
26. Plaintiff created an organization, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida corporation,
directly related to her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse. Doc.1 1 24-25.
27. The "goal" of Victims Refuse Silence "was, and continues to be, to help survivors
surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse."
Id. 9| 25. Toward this end, plaintiff has "dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex
trafficking." Id.
8


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page16 of 77
28. Plaintiff repeatedly has sought out media organizations to discuss her alleged
experience as a victim of sexual abuse. See This Motion at 19l 51-54.
29. As discussed above, on December 30, 2014, plaintiff publicly filed an "entirely
unnecessary" joinder motion laden with what Judge Marra described as "unnecessary,"* "lurid
details" about being "sexually abused" as a "minor victim[]" by wealthy and famous men and
being "trafficked" all around the world as a "sex slave." EXHIBIT D, at 1 n. 1, 3-6.
30. The plaintiff's alleged purpose in filing the joinder motion was to "vindicate" her
rights under the CVRA, expose the government's "secretly negotiated" "non-prosecution
agreement" with Epstein, "shed tremendous public light" on Epstein and "other powerful
individuals" that would undermine the agreement, and support the CVRA plaintiffs' request for
documents that would show how Epstein "used his powerful political and social connections to
secure a favorable plea deal" and the government's "motive" to aid Epstein and his "co-
conspirators." See EXHIBIT D, at 1, 6-7, 10 (emphasis supplied).
31. Plaintiff has written the manuscript of a book she has been trying to publish detailing
her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse and of sex trafficking in Epstein's alleged "sex
scheme." ExHIBIT KK
32. Republication alleged by plaintiff. Plaintiff was required by Interrogatory No. 6 to
identify any false statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell that were 'published globally, including

'The undisputed facts relevant to this Motion are contained in the Facts section, above,

within the Southern District of New York," as plaintiff alleged in Paragraph 9 of Count I of her
complaint. In response, plaintiff identified the January 2015 statement and nine instances in
which various news media published portions of the January 2015 statement in news articles or
broadcast stories. EXHIBIT H, at 7-8; EXHIBIT I, at 4.
33. In none of the nine instances was there any publication of the entire January 2015
statement. See EXHIBIT H, at 7-8; EXHIBIT I, at 4.
34. Ms. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or authority over any media
organization, including the media identified in plaintiff's response to Interrogatory No. 6, in
connection with the media's publication of portions of the January 2015 statement. EXHIBIT J
124; EXHIBIT K 19 2-3..
35. Plaintiff's defamation action against Ms. Maxwell. Eight years after Epstein's
guilty plea, plaintiff brought this action, repeating many of the allegations she made in her
CVRA joinder motion. See Doc. 1 99.
36. The complaint alleged that the January 2015 statement "contained the following
deliberate falsehoods":
(a) That Giuffre's sworn allegations "against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue."
(b) That the allegations have been "shown to be untrue."
(c) That Giuffre's "claims are obvious lies."
Doc. 1 9 30 (boldface and underscoring omitted).
SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
"[C]ourts should not be reluctant to grant summary judgment in appropriate cases. 'One
of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually
insupportable claims, thereby permitting courts to avoid 'protracted, expensive and harassing
trials.'" Don King Prods., Inc. v. Douglas, 742 F. Supp. 778, 780 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (quoting
10


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page18 of 77
Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986), and Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 998
(2d Cir. 1985)). Where summary judgment is sought under Article I, Section 8, of the New York
Constitution, the New York Court of Appeals has declared, "we reaffirm our regard for the
particular value of summary judgment, where appropriate, in libel cases, " Immuno AG v. Moor-
Jankowski, 567 N.E.2d 1270, 1282 (N.Y. 1991), particularly when as here a defendant is
challenging a defamation claim under the "independent State law approach" articulated in
Immuno AG that might make summary disposition more likely than under a federal approach, see
id.
Summary judgment is appropriate where "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact
and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The
relevant inquiry on application for summary judgment is "whether the evidence presents a
sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one
party must prevail as a matter of law." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52
(1986).
"[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat
an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be
no genuine issue of material fact." Id. at 247-48. The substantive law determines what facts are
material. Id. at 248. "Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the
governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are
irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted." Id. A dispute about a material fact is "genuine" if
the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party." Id.
In the face of a properly supported summary judgment motion, the plaintiff may not "rest
on [the] allegations" in her complaint. Id. at 249. The trial court's function is to determine


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page19 of 77
whether there is a genuine issue for trial, and "there is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient
evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party." Id.
"[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment... against
a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential
to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp.
v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). In such a situation, "there can be 'no genuine issue as to
any material fact,' since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the
nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is
'entitled to a judgment as a matter of law' because the nonmoving party has failed to make a
sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden
of proof." Id. at 323; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 advisory committee's notes (2010 amendments)
(restoration of "shall grant summary judgment" was intended to "express the direction to grant
summary judgment, and "avoids the unintended consequences of any other word").
ARGUMENT
I. Ms. Maxwell is not liable for republications of her January 2015 statement that she
did not authorize or request and by entities she did not control.
A. Summary judgment is warranted to the extent plaintiff seeks to impose liability
on any media's republication of all or a portion of the January 2015 statement.
Messrs. Barden and Gow, acting on behalf of Ms. Maxwell, caused the January 2015
statement to be transmitted-published—to various individuals employed by media
organizations. The question presented in this Argument I is whether Ms. Maxwell is liable for
any republication of all or a portion of the January 2015 statement by the media. Under New
York law, the answer is no.
Liability for a republication "must be based on real authority to influence the final
product." Davis v. Costa-Gavras, 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1096 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (emphasis supplied).
12


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page20 of 77
"[W]here a defendant 'had no actual part in composing or publishing,' he cannot be held liable
'without disregarding the settled rule of law that no man is bound for the tortious act of another
over whom he has not a master's power of control.'" Id. (quoting Folwell v. Miller, 145 F. 495,
497 (2d Cir. 1906)); see Geraci v. Probst, 938 N.E.2d 917, 921 (N.Y. 2010) (holding that
defendant was not liable for republication, in part because "there is no indication that Probst had
any control over whether or not Newsday published the article"). "Conclusive evidence of lack
of actual authority [is] sufficiently dispositive that the [trial court] 'ha[s] no option but to dismiss
the case ....'" Id. (quoting Rinaldi v. Viking Penguin, Inc., 420 N.E.2d 377, 382 (N.Y. 1981)).
As the New York Court of Appeals held in Geraci:
t is too well settled to be now questioned that one who... prints and publishes
ibel[] is not responsible for its voluntary and unjustifiable repetition, without hi
authority or request, by others over whom he has no control and who thereby
make themselves liable to the person injured, and that such repetition cannot be
considered in law a necessary, natural and probable consequence of the original
slander or libel.
938 N.E.2d at 921 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The rationale behind this rule is that
"each person who repeats the defamatory statement is responsible for the resulting damages." Id.
(internal quotations omitted).
With the goal of garnering maximum publicity and defaming Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Giuffre
filed an "entirely unnecessary" joinder motion with "lurid details" about sexual acts for the
purpose of attracting the attention of the public, which was "'curious, titillated or intrigued'"8
about alleged sexual acts and relationships among the rich and famous. In defense of
Ms. Maxwell's reputation, Messrs. Barden and Gow responded with the January 2015 statement.

The email transmitting the statement explained it was "a quotable statement on behalf of
Ms Maxwell" and "[n]o further communication will be provided by her on this matter."
ExHIBIT F (emphasis supplied). The media representatives were notified that if they intended to
use the statement, it was to be quoted in its entirety. See This Motion | 24, at 8. Ms. Maxwell
and Messrs. Barden and Gow had no ability to control whether or how the media-recipients
would use the statement, and they made no effort to control whether or how they would use the
statement. EXHIBIT K 19 2-3; EXHIBIT J 9 24.
Ms. Maxwell is not responsible for any republication of the January 2015 statement,
whether it was republished in whole or in part, since she had no authority or control over any
media that published any portion of it. In the words of this Court, she had no "real authority to
influence the final product," Davis, 580 F. Supp. at 1096.
The media's selective, partial republication of the statement is more problematic yet. An
original publisher of a statement cannot be charged with a republisher's "editing and excerpting
of her statement." Rand v. New York Times Co., 430 N. Y.S.2d 271, 275 (App. Div. 1980). The
rule applies with even greater force where as here a defamation claim is grounded on the
expression of opinion: An individual "cannot be liable for the republication of a derogatory but
constitutionally protected opinion when the foundation upon which that opinion is based is
omitted. The defamatory remark should be 'read against the background of its issuance.'" Id.
(quoting Mencher v. Chesley, 75 N.E.2d 257, 259 (N.Y. 1947), and citing James v. Gannett Co.,
353 N.E.2d 834, 838 (N. Y. 1976)).
'Plaintiff has not disclosed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) any republication of the
entirety of the January 2015 statement. In response to our discovery requests requiring her to
identify republications of all or a portion of the statement, plaintiff identified no republication of
the entirety of the statement.
14


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page22 of 77
The rationale for this rule is found in the New York Court of Appeals' explanation of
how an original publisher's allegedly defamatory statement should be interpreted:
The statement complained of will be read against the background of its issuance
with respect to the circumstances of its publication. It is the duty of the court, in
an action for libel, to understand the publication in the same manner that others
would naturally do. The construction which it behooves a court of justice to put
on a publication which is alleged to be libelous is to be derived as well from the
expressions used as from the whole scope and apparent object of the writer.
James, 353 N.E.2d at 838 (emphasis supplied; citations and internal quotations omitted).
The January 2015 statement was intended to be read by the media-recipients in its
entirety. One, it was intended to be a comprehensive, one-time-only response to all of plaintiff's
lurid and false allegations of sexual and other misconduct by Ms. Maxwell. See ExHIBIT J 9 13.
Two, the statement was complex in that it could not be quoted partially and out of context and
still convey the intended meaning. Among other things, the statement was intended to show why
plaintiff could not be believed— why her allegations are "obvious lies"—by pointing out how her
story changed each time she retold the story. As Mr. Barden explains:
Selective and partial quotation and use of the statement would disserve my
purposes. It was intended to address Plaintiff's behavior and allegations against
Ms. Maxwell on a broad scale, that is to say, Plaintiff's history of making false
allegations and innuendo to the media against Ms. Maxwell. This is why the
tatement references Plaintiff's "original allegations" and points out that her stor
'changes"—i.e. is embellished—over time including the allegations "now" tha
Professor Dershowitz allegedly had sexual relations with her. This is why I
distinguished in the statement between Plaintiff's "original" allegations and her
"new," joinder-motion allegations, which differed substantially from the original
allegations. And this is why I wrote, "Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes
with new salacious details about public figures and world leaders and now it is
alleged by [Plaintiff] that Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual
relations with her, which he denies." (Emphasis supplied.) Having established the
dramatic difference between Plaintiff's two sets of allegations, which suggested
she was fabricating more and more-salacious allegations as she had more time to
manufacture them, I added the third paragraph: "[Ms. Giuffre's] claims are
obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as they are
defamatory." (Emphasis supplied.) I believed then, and believe now, that it was
and remains a fair inference and conclusion that her claims were and are "obvious
15


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page23 of 77
lies." As noted, her claims not to have slept with Prince Andrew and to have slept
with Prince Andrew are a classic example of an obvious lie. One or other account
is on the face of it a lie.
EXHIBIT J 9 20. That Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell was expressing his opinion-in the
form of a legal argument—as a lawyer would be lost if words and phrases are extracted from and
used outside the context of the January 2015 statement. Yet, this is precisely what the media did
in their articles on the statement and what plaintiff did in her complaint (see Doc. 1 | 30).
Finally, the statement was intended to be a "shot across the bow" of the media-recipients so that
they understood the seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of
plaintiff's obviously false allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. See id.
1 17. Selectively excerpting from the statement would seriously undermine this purpose by
changing the force of the message to the media-recipients.
Under these circumstances, selective, partial and out-of-context republication of
Mr. Barden's deliberate and carefully crafted message to the media-representatives, as a matter
of law, cannot result in defamation liability for Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, the Court should
enter partial summary judgment.
B. Because plaintiff is a limited public figure, imposing liability upon Ms. Maxwell
for republication of the January 2015 statement would violate the First
Amendment.
As this Court recognized in Davis, New York Times v. Sullivan' and its progeny
"preclude states from imposing liability without fault in actions for defamation, especially by
public figures." 580 F. Supp. at 1097 (citing, inter alia, Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S.
323 (1974)). This principle precludes the imposition of liability for republication of an allegedly
10376 U.S. 254 (1964).
16


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page24 of 77
defamatory statement on a party who had no "actual ... responsibility for the decision to
republish" the statement. Id.
A public figure includes a person who "voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a
particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues."
Gertz, 418 U.S. at 351; see, e.g., James, 353 N.E.2d at 839 (public figure includes those who
have "thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence
the resolution of the issues involved"). The evidence that plaintiff is a public figure is
overwhelming, particularly in connection with the subject matters and issues addressed by and
underlying the January 2015 statement. See This Motion 19 51-54.
In the case at bar, Ms. Maxwell and her agents had no responsibility for any media
organization's decision to republish the January 2015 statement, and they did not participate in
any such decision. See ExHIBIts J 9| 24 & K 11 2-3. Liability for republication by media
organizations of the January 2015 statement therefore is precluded under the First Amendment.
C. Plaintiff should be barred from introducing into evidence any republication of
an excerpt from the January 2015 statement.
In Geraci, the plaintiff suggested in a letter to the Long Island fire district where
defendant was a commissioner that defendant had engaged in self-dealing in the district's
purchase of fire trucks. At trial the plaintiff sought to introduce into evidence portions of a
Newsday article that republished parts of the defendant's letter. Defense counsel objected,
arguing it was inflammatory and prejudicial. Plaintiff's counsel later argued the article "was not
being offered as a republication, but on the issue of damages to show how far the allegations had
circulated." 938 N.E.2d at 920. Additionally, plaintiff's counsel argued that the defendant
"should have reasonably anticipated" that his letter to the fire district "would be newsworthy."
Id. The trial court admitted the article, and the Appellate Division affirmed
17


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page25 of 77
The New York Court of Appeals reversed. The risk of admitting such evidence, the court
held, is the jury may "charge against defendant a separate, distinct libel (not pleaded in [the]
complaint) by someone else, contrary to the rule that [t]he original publisher of a libel is not
responsible for its subsequent publication by others." Geraci, 938 N.E.2d at 921. Accordingly,
the court held, "[A]bsent a showing that [defendant] approved or participated in some other
manner in the activities of the third-party republisher[,]' there is no basis for allowing the jury to
consider the article containing the republished statement as a measure of plaintiff's damages
attributable to defendants." Id. (emphasis supplied; quoting Karaduman v. Newsday, Inc., 416
N.E.2d 557, 560 (1980)).
Neither Ms. Maxwell nor her agents approved or participated in any activity of any media
organization in its decision to publish or not to publish any part of the January 2015 statement.
EXHIBIT J 9 2; K 99 2-3.. Accordingly, "there is no basis for allowing the jury to consider [any]
article containing the republished statement as a measure of plaintiff's damages attributable to
[Ms. Maxwell]," id. Plaintiff should be barred from introducing any evidence of any
republication of the January 2015 statement by any non-party. See, e.g., Soley v. Wasserman, No.
8 CIV. 9262 KMW FM, 2013 WL 3185555, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2013) (precluding plaintiff
from adducing evidence intended to establish claim on which court had entered partial summary
judgment).
II. Summary judgment is warranted under the New York Constitution.
A. The January 2015 statement constitutes nonactionable opinion.
«Whether particular words are defamatory presents a legal question to be resolved by
the court in the first instance."" Germain v. M & T Bank Corp., 111 F. Supp. 3d 506, 534

177 (2d Cir. 2000)); accord, e.g., Aronson v. Wiersma, 483 N.E.2d 1138, 1139 (N.Y. 1985). New
York defamation law applies. Doc.37 at 6 n.2.
"It is a settled rule that expressions of an opinion false or not, libelous or not, are
constitutionally protected and may not be the subject of private damage actions." Steinhilber v.
Alphonse, 501 N.E.2d 550, 550 (N.Y. 1986) (internal quotations omitted). Whether a challenged
statement is fact or opinion is a question of law to be decided by the Court. Enigma Software
Grp. USA, LLC v. Bleeping Computer LLC, No. 16 CIV. 57 (PAE), 2016 WL 3773394, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2016); accord, e.g., Steinhilber, 501 N.E.2d at 553.
In Immuno AG v. Moor-Jankowski," the New York Court of Appeals declared that the
New York Constitution provides greater protection to opinion than the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution. The court recognized that in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497
U.S. 1 (1990), the United States Supreme Court reversed a state court decision dismissing a
complaint on the ground that the allegedly defamatory statement was nonactionable opinion. The
Supreme Court held there is no "wholesale defamation exemption" protecting opinion. The First
Amendment analysis under Milkovich, the New York court observed, was one-dimensional: the
trial court should look first to the allegedly defamatory statement's specific words as commonly
understood and then determine whether the statements were "verifiable"; if the statements were
verifiable, then they were actionable statements of fact. See Immuno AG, 567 N.E.2d at 1274-75.
The Supreme Court's holding made it clear that it would not consider as part of the First
Amendment analysis "the full context of the article in which the challenged statements appear,
and the broader social context or setting surrounding the communication." Id. at 1274.
'567 N.E.2d 1270 (N.Y. 1991).
19


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page27 of 77
The Immuno AG Court of Appeals held that Article I, Section 8, of the New York
Constitution required a multidimensional approach to the determination whether an allegedly
defamatory statement constitutes constitutionally protected opinion. The court gave numerous
reasons. New York's "expansive" constitutional guarantee of speech was formulated and adopted
before the application of the First Amendment to the states; "Ti]t has long been our standard in
defamation actions" to consider factors beyond whether facts are "verifiable"; and the court was
concerned that if "type of speech' is to be construed narrowlyL,] ... insufficient protection may
be accorded to central values protected by the law of this State." Id. at 1277-78. The Immuno AG
court reaffirmed that where a defendant alleges that the subject statement is opinion, Steinhilber
supplies the analytical framework. Id. at 1280.
Steinhilber held that whether an allegedly defamatory statement is fact or nonactionable
opinion should be decided based on four factors: (1) an assessment of whether the specific
language in issue has a precise meaning which is readily understood or whether it is indefinite
and ambiguous; (2) a determination of whether the statement is capable of being objectively
characterized as true or false; (3) an examination of the full context of the communication in
which the statement appears; and (4) a consideration of the broader social context or setting
surrounding the communication including the existence of any applicable customs or
conventions which might signal to readers or listeners that what is being read or heard is likely to
be opinion, not fact. 501 N.E.2d at 554.
Application of these factors to the January 2015 statement compels the conclusion that
the allegedly defamatory words, phrases and clauses are nonactionable opinion.
Whether the specific language in issue has a precise meaning which is readily
understood or whether it is indefinite and ambiguous. The three sentences plaintiff alleges are
20


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page28 of 77
defamatory are indefinite and ambiguous. The first says plaintiff's "allegations" against
Ms. Maxwell are "untrue." But plaintiff has made many dozens of allegations against
Ms. Maxwell, and some are provably false. See This Motion, at 19 37-50. The statement does not
specify which of the allegations are untrue. The second statement is that the "original
allegations" have been "shown to be untrue." The "original allegations" were first revealed in the
2011 Churcher articles. Plaintiff made many dozens of allegations "originally." The statement
does not specify which of the "original" allegations were shown to be untrue. Some have been
shown to be untrue. See This Motion, at 53-65. The third statement is that plaintiff's "claims" are
"obvious lies." This too is indefinite and ambiguous. Plaintiff has made many dozens of claims.
The statement does not specify which ones are being referenced. More importantly, it does not
say how or why some of the claims are "obvious" lies. Regardless, some of plaintiff's claims are
"obvious lies." See This Motion, at 53-65.
Whether the three sentences in the January 2015 statement are capable of being
objectively characterized as true or false. Can the three sentences be characterized as true or
false? They cannot, because the statement does not specify which of the many dozens of
allegations plaintiff has made are "untrue" and "shown to be untrue," and which of plaintiff's
many dozens of "claims" are "obvious lies."
It is axiomatic that the plural form of a word, e.g., "allegations" and "claims," universally
denotes only-"more than one," People v. Kocsis, 28 N. Y.S.3d 466, 471 (App. Div. 2016)
(emphasis supplied). See, e.g., Lehman Bros. Commercial Corp. v. Minmetals Int'l Non-Ferrous
Metals Trading Co., No. 94 CIV. 8301(JFK), 1995 WL 380119, at *6 n.2 (S.D.N. Y. June 26,
1995). So for Steinhilber purposes it is dispositive of the fact versus opinion question if we can
21


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page29 of 77
identify two instances in which plaintiff's allegations or claims'? are incapable of being proved
true or false. Such examples abound. It cannot be proven true or false whether Ms. Maxwell
"appreciated the immunity granted"'3 under the Epstein plea agreement or whether she "act/ed]
as a 'madame' for Epstein'"'4 That is because these are plaintiff's counsel's arguments or
opinions. The January 2015 statement asserts that these allegations/claims are "false" or
"obvious lies." That assertion cannot be proven true or false under Steinhilber.
The full context of the communication in which the statement appears. This factor "is
often the key consideration in categorizing a statement as fact or opinion." Davis v. Boeheim, 22
N.E.3d 999, 1006 (N.Y. 2014) (internal quotations omitted).
In deciding whether a statement is defamatory, "It]he words must be construed in the
context of the entire statement or publication as a whole, tested against the understanding of the
average reader." Aronson v. Wiersma, 483 N.E.2d 1138, 1139 (1985); accord Elias v. Rolling
Stone LLC, No. 15-CV-5953 (PKC), 2016 WL 3583080, at *6 (S.D.N. Y. June 28, 2016). 'It is

1In the context of the January 2015 statement, an "allegation" is synonymous with a
"claim." See, e.g., Maule v. Philadelphia Media Holdings, LLC, No. CIV.A. 08-3357, 2010 WL
914926, at *10 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 15, 2010); see generally Black's Law Dictionary 68 (5" ed. 1979)
(defining "allegation" as "[t]he assertion, claim, declaration, or statement of a party to an action,
made in a pleading, setting out what he expects to prove"), quoted with approval in Martin v.
City of Oceanside, 205 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1147 (S.D. Cal. 2002), aff'd, 360 F.3d 1078 (" Cir.

In general the trial court should view allegedly defamatory statements from the
perspective of the average member of the public. Statements directed to a specific audience,
however, are considered from the viewpoint of that audience. Instructive is this Court's analysis
of the perspective from which it should assess an allegedly defamatory article on boxing
published to sports readers:
The issue of how the "average reader" would construe the statements is
certainly a fair one, for the question of whether statements are defamatory turns
on how the audience to whom the statements are addressed would interpret
them... As the New York State Court of Appeals has explained in [a] boxing-
defamation case[]: ....
"The words are to be construed not with the close
precision expected from lawyers and judges but as they would be read and
understood by the public to which they are addressed..."
Here, the statements in question were addressed to readers of an Internet
boxing website and the sports pages of daily newspapers. The statements must be
considered from their viewpoint. As Judge Martin... held [in Horne v. Matthews,
No. 97 Civ. 3605(JSM), 1997 WL 598452 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 1997)]: "An article
on the sports page of a newspaper should be viewed from the perspective of the
audience to whom it is addressed, i.e., the understanding of "a sophisticated and
sports-conscious reader."

The entirety of the email containing the January 2015 statement from Mr. Gow sent to

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts— so not a new individual. The allegations made by
Victoria Roberts [sic] against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original
allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about
public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that
Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he
denies.
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not
publicised as news, as they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains
the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which
have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek
redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.
EXHIBIT F (italics and underscoring supplied).
Plaintiff listed the underscored clauses/phrases in the Complaint as the "deliberate
falsehoods," Doc.1 9 30, and "false and defamatory statements," id. 9| 32, plaintiff is suing on.!
As discussed above, it is improper to remove from their context and isolate allegedly defamatory
words, phrases and clauses of sentences from an allegedly defamatory publication. Instead, the
allegedly defamatory words, phrases and clauses must be (a) "construed in the context of the
entire statement or publication as a whole"; 16 (b) considered "from the whole scope and apparent
object of the writer",! and (c) "viewed from the perspective of the audience to whom it is
addressed."18
The statement was directed at a discrete number of-some 30-
-members of the media in
reply to their request for a response from Ms. Maxwell to Ms. Giuffre's CVRA joinder motion.
15 Plaintiff also alleges that Ms. Maxwell slandered her on January 4, 2015, when
responding to a question posed to her while she was on a Manhattan street. Doc.1 9 37. This
allegedly defamatory statement is addressed in Argument IV, below.

Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend the January 2015 statement
to be a traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media. EXHIBIT K 9 15.
So he did not request that Mr. Gow or any other public relations specialist prepare the statement.
Id. Instead, Mr. Gow served only as Mr. Barden's conduit to the media representatives who had
requested a response to the joinder motion allegations and who Mr. Barden believed might
republish those allegations. Id.
Mr. Barden intended the statement to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's reputation
from the press's republication of plaintiff's false allegations. Id. 9 16. He believed this could be
accomplished by suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject plaintiff's
allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. Id. For example, he noted that plaintiff's allegations changed
dramatically over time, suggesting that they are "obvious lies" and therefore should not be
"publicised as news." Id.
Mr. Barden also intended the January 2015 statement to be "a shot across the bow" of the
media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations without
conducting any inquiry of their own. Id. I 17. So Mr. Barden stated repeatedly that plaintiff's
allegations were "defamatory." Id. In this sense, the statement was very much intended as a cease
and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the seriousness
with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false allegations and
the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. Id.
Consistent with Mr. Barden's purposes for the statement, Mr. Gow's emails prefaced
the statement with the following language: "Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf
of Ms Maxwell" (emphasis supplied). Id. 9 19. The statement was intended to be a single, one-
time-only, comprehensive response quoted in full
I to plaintiff's December 30, 2014,
25


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page33 of 77
allegations that would give the media Ms. Maxwell's response. Id. The purpose of the prefatory
statement was to inform the media-recipients of this intent. Id.
We note that plaintiff in her Complaint makes the same mistake as the Steinhilber
plaintiff extracting words and phrases from their opinion context so that she can claim the
assertion of a "defamatory" fact. See Doc. 1 9| 30. That is not permissible. See Steinhilber, 501
N.E.2d at 555 ("The sentence which plaintiff selects from the message and claims is "factually
laden"-impugning her as lacking in "talent, ambition, and initiative" —is preceded and
followed by statements which are clearly part of the attempt at humor prevailing
throughout ...").
The broader social context or setting surrounding the communication, including the
existence of any applicable customs or conventions which might signal to readers that what
is being read is likely to be opinion, not fact. This factor is concerned with "the factual
background" leading up to the preparation of the statement. It is a critical factor here. In
December 2014, plaintiff and her lawyers had timed for maximum effect during the slow news
cycle between Christmas and New Year's Day—the public filing of a superfluous motion filled
with salacious and provocative allegations of "sexual abuse" and "sexual trafficking" involving
wealthy and prominent Americans. Plaintiff deliberately placed Ms. Maxwell in the middle of
the abuse and trafficking, alleging that she recruited plaintiff into the sexual abuse/trafficking
scheme and engaged in numerous criminal acts.
Importantly, three years earlier when plaintiff was interviewed extensively by Churcher
for two lengthy articles published in March 2011, plaintiff's allegations concerning Ms. Maxwell
were very much different. In the articles discussing plaintiff's "shocking account"1° of being
1ºEXHIBIT A, at 2.
26


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page34 of 77
sexually exploited by Epstein, Prince Andrew and Epstein's "male peers,"2° plaintiff made
virtually none of what Judge Marra found were "unnecessary"?! and "lurid details"22 about how
Ms. Maxwell allegedly had subjected her to sexual abuse and trafficking.
After plaintiff filed the CVRA motion, some thirty reporters contacted Ms. Maxwell's
press representative, Mr. Gow, for Ms. Maxwell's response. As Ms. Maxwell's lawyer, Mr.
Barden undertook that task. Relying on his knowledge of the 2011 articles publishing plaintiff's
allegations and drawing on his experience and training as a lawyer, Mr. Barden crafted a
response with the goal of discrediting plaintiff and what the statement called plaintiff's "new"
allegations. To that end Mr. Barden contrasted plaintiff's "old" allegations from 2011 with the
"new" 2014 allegations. The second paragraph of the statement is indicative of this strategy:
"Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about public figures
and world leaders and now it is alleged by [Ms. Giuffre] that Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved
in having sexual relations with her, which he denies." EXHIBIT F (emphasis supplied). Having
established the dramatic difference between these sets of allegations suggesting plaintiff was
fabricating more and more-salacious allegations as she had more time to manufacture them,
Mr. Barden added the third paragraph: "[Ms. Giuffre's] claims are obvious lies and should be
treated as such and not publicised as news, as they are defamatory." Id. (emphasis supplied).
Mr. Barden's arguments constitute "pure opinion," Steinhilber, 501 N.E.2d at 552. They
take established and revealed facts—plaintiff's modest 2011 allegations to a newspaper reporter
and plaintiff's expansive, unnecessary and lurid 2014 allegations in a motion to open the door to

criminal prosecutions of (and civil lawsuits against) wealthy and prominent men around the
world-to draw an obvious inference that plaintiff was (more) truthful in the 2011 articles and
engaged in massive manufacturing of fiction in the 2014 joinder motion. There is no limit to the
subject matters on which pure opinions may be expressed with constitutional immunity,
including whether a person believes another is "lying" or is a "liar." See, e.g., Indep. Living Aids,
Inc. v. Maxi-Aids, Inc., 981 F. Supp. 124, 128 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (granting summary judgment:
"Read in the context of the entire article, Zaretsky's remarks, calling Sandler and others 'liars,'
can only be understood as a denial of their accusations.... Even the most careless reader must
have perceived that the words were no more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet used by
Zaretsky who considered himself unfairly treated and sought to bring what he alleged were the
true facts to the readers. The epithet 'liar' in this context, standing by itself, merely expressed the
opinion that anyone who persisted in accusing Zaretsky of improper business practices could not
be telling the truth. Since the basis for this opinion was fully set forth, the communication of
Zaretsky's views cannot be libelous.") (citations, ellipsis, brackets and internal quotations
omitted); see Gross v. New York Times, 623 N.E.2d 1163, 1169 (N.Y. 1993) ("[E]ven when
uttered or published in a ... serious tone, accusations of criminality could be regarded as mere
hypothesis and therefore not actionable if the facts on which they are based are fully and
accurately set forth and it is clear to the reasonable reader... that the accusation is merely a
personal surmise built upon those facts. In all cases, whether the challenged remark concerns
criminality or some other defamatory category, the courts are obliged to consider the
communication as a whole, as well as its immediate and broader social contexts, to determine
whether the reasonable listener... is likely to understand the remark as an assertion of provable
fact.").
28


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page36 of 77
Mr. Barden's inference from disclosed facts qualifies as "pure opinion," Steinhilber, 501
N.E.2d at 552. Accordingly, that Mr. Barden characterized plaintiff's 2014 allegations harshly as
"obvious lies" as opposed to "untruths" or some softer term is of no moment. "[U]nder New
York law, pure opinion... is not actionable because expressions of opinion, as opposed to
assertions of fact, are deemed privileged and, no matter how offensive, cannot be the subject of
an action for defamation." Ratajack v. Brewster Fire Dep't, Inc. of the Brewster-SE Joint Fire
Dist., 178 F. Supp. 3d 118, 158 (S.D.N. Y. 2016) (internal quotations and ellipsis omitted;
brackets altered); accord, e.g., Mann v. Abel, 885 N.E.2d 884, 885-86 (N.Y. 2008).
The drawing of such inferences would be constitutionally protected even under the
standards of the First Amendment that are less protective of opinion than is Article I, Section 8,
of the New York Constitution. See Adelson v. Harris, 973 F. Supp. 2d 467, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)
('In determining whether a statement constitutes constitutionally protected opinion, courts also
look to the specific context of the statement. When looking at a statement's specific context, of
particular importance is the principle that when an author outlines the facts available to him, thus
making it clear that the challenged statements represent his own interpretation of those facts and
leaving the reader free to draw his own conclusions, those statements are generally protected by
the First Amendment.") (internal quotations and brackets omitted).
The application of the four Steinhilber factors confirms that the three phrases and/or
clauses plaintiff alleges are defamatory are in fact part of a statement that taken as a whole
constitutes nonactionable opinion. The premise of plaintiff's Complaint is that once she is able to
identify references in the January 2015 statement to any assertion of fact that potentially is
subject to proof, e.g., the truth or falsity of her many dozens of allegations old and new, then she
has a viable defamation claim. That ignores the teaching of Steinhilber and Immuno AG. As the
29


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page37 of 77
Steinhilber court held, "even apparent statements of fact may assume the character of statements
of opinion, and thus be privileged, when made in public debate, heated labor dispute, or other
circumstances in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or
hyperbole." Id. (internal quotations and brackets omitted); see Gross, 623 N.E.2d at 1169 ("we
stress once again our commitment to avoiding the 'hypertechnical parsing' of written and spoken
words for the purpose of identifying 'possible "fact[s]"" that might form the basis of sustainable
libel action"') (quoting Immuno AG, 567 N.E.2d at 1282).
To the same effect is this Court's citation to a Louisiana Supreme Court decision for the
proposition that "[w]ords which, taken by themselves, would appear to be a positive allegation
of fact, may be shown by the context to be a mere expression of opinion or argumentative
influence."" Adelson, 973 F. Supp. 2d at 488 (emphasis supplied; quoting Mashburn v. Collin,
355 So. 2d 879, 885 (La. 1977)).
It also is important to take into account, as Steinhilber requires, that Mr. Barden was
directing the January 2015 statement to a discrete number of media representatives who were
aware of plaintiff's "original" and "new," joinder-motion allegations and who were requesting a
response from Ms. Maxwell to the "new" allegations. These newspaper reporters and other
media representatives would have the point Mr. Barden was making the opinion he was
expressing namely, that there was good reason to believe plaintiff was fabricating allegations
for her purposes. In the context of the media circus that ensued the public filing of the joinder
motion and the media's repeated and insistent requests for an immediate response from
Ms. Maxwell, it is highly unlikely any media-recipients of the January 2015 statement expected
anything other than a statement equivalent to the March 2011 statement condemning the
allegations; and it is highly likely all the media-recipients understood the statement to be a
30


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page38 of 77
forceful argument that plaintiff's shifting and inconsistent stories about what allegedly happened
rendered her inherently unbelievable and proved her increasingly provocative and lurid
allegations were "obvious lies." These are precisely the messages Mr. Barden sent to them.
The general nature of Mr. Barden's assertions ("allegations," "original allegations,"
"claims"), the distinction between plaintiff's "original" and "new" allegations, and the inferences
he drew from comparing the "original" and "new" allegations together-powerfully
demonstrate that the January 2015 statement was nothing more than opinion.
B. In this Rule 56 proceeding, this Court's Rule 12(b)(6) opinion does not control
the question of law whether the January 2015 statement constitutes
nonactionable opinion.
In its Rule 12(b)(6) opinion the Court, relying on Davis v. Boeheim, 22 N.E.3d 999
(2014), ruled that the three allegedly defamatory statements in the January 2015 statement (see
Doc. 1 | 30(a)-(c)) have a specific and readily understood factual meaning, are capable of being
proven true or false, and "clearly constitute fact to the reader." Doc.37 at 9. We respectfully
suggest the Court's Rule 12(b)(6) decision does not control in this Rule 56 proceeding.
To begin with, the standards for deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion are substantially
different from the standards for deciding a Rule 56 motion. As the Court noted, in deciding a
12(b)(6) motion the court must accept as true the factual allegations and draw all inferences in
the plaintiff's favor; a plaintiff need only state a claim that is "plausible on its face." Id. at 3
(internal quotations omitted). In contrast, in deciding a Rule 56 motion the plaintiff defending the
motion may not "rest on [the] allegations" in her complaint. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. The
difference in the standards is crucial here.
As this Court recognized, '[t]he dispositive inquiry'" for purposes of deciding whether
an allegedly defamatory statement is fact or nonactionable opinion is whether "' a reasonable
reader could have concluded that the statements were conveying facts about the plaintiff."
31


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page39 of 77
Doc.37 at 7 (quoting Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1005). To answer that inquiry, the Court applied the
three factors enumerated in Davis. See id. These three factors are the same as the four factors in
Immuno AG; the difference is that the Davis court collapsed the Immuno AG's third and fourth
factors into one. See Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1005.
As framed by the Davis court, the third factor is "whether either the full context of the
communication in which the statement appears or the broader social context and surrounding
circumstances are such as to signal ... readers or listeners that what is being read or heard is
likely to be opinion, not fact." Id. (internal quotations omitted; emphasis supplied), quoted in
Doc.37 at 7. Although this Court did not note this in its opinion, this third factor "is often the key
consideration in categorizing a statement as fact or opinion." Id. at 1006 (emphasis supplied).
As in Davis, which also was decided on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, this Court when
considering the third factor did not have the benefit of any of the evidence presented in this
motion. That is to say, the Court did not have the "full context of the" July 2015 statement or the
"broader social context and surrounding circumstances" of the statement, since none of the
evidence presented in this Motion was pleaded in the Complaint.
Nor, in the context of the 12(b)(6) motion, did the Court consider that the relevant
"readers" of the July 2015 statement were not the "average reader"24 in the general public, but a
"cynical'"25 and "sophisticated"26
group of about 30 reporters and journalists who were
knowledgeable about plaintiff's allegations of being the victim of sexual abuse and sexual

trafficking. Viewing the July 2015 statement from the perspective of these reporters and
journalists the only persons who received the July 2015 statement—presents a different
landscape in the "fact versus opinion" analysis.
Applying the third factor with the benefit of the Rule 56 records compels a conclusion
different from the one this Court reached on the barren Rule 12(b)(6) record. For example, this
Court did not consider that the media-recipients of the July 2015 statement would have
understood the statement in precisely the way Mr. Barden intended: Based on a comparison of
dramatic differences between her "original" and "new" allegations, Ms. Giuffre is a teller of
falsehoods—is a liar-and cannot be trusted, and her new CVRA joint-motion allegations, which
deviated so substantially from her originally allegations, are falsehoods-proven false by her
increasingly provocative and lurid versions of her story of "victimhood." See generally Exhibit J.
III. The pre-litigation privilege bars this action.
Statements pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation made by attorneys (or their
agents under their direction"') before the commencement of litigation are privileged and "no
cause of action for defamation can be based on those statements," Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 28
N.E.3d 15, 16 (N.Y. 2015). So long as there was "a good faith basis to anticipate litigation," a
statement concerning either "actual litigation or prelitigation matters" is subject to an "absolute
privilege." Flomenhaft v. Finkelstein, 8 N. Y.S.3d 161, 164 n.2 (App. Div. 2015) (emphasis
supplied); accord Kirk v. Heppt, 532 F. Supp. 2d 586, 593 (S.D.N. Y. 2008).
The privilege covers statements made in connection with "pending or "contemplated
litigation." Goldstein v. Cogswell, No. 85 CIV. 9256 (KMW), 1992 WL 131723, at *27 n.32
(S.D.N.Y. June 1, 1992) It covers statements made outside court, including in written
27 See Chambers v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 2016 WL 3533998, at *8 (D.N.J. June
28, 2016); see generally Hawkins v. Harris, 661 A.2d 284, 289-91 (N.J. 1995).
33


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page41 of 77
communications "between litigating parties or their attorneys." Klein v. McGauley, 29. A.D.2d
418, 420 (N.Y. App. Div. 1968), cited with approval in Petrus v. Smith, 91 A.D.2d 1190, 1191
(N.Y. App. App. Div. 1983). It covers "cease and desist letters." Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19. And it
covers "all pertinent communications among the parties, counsel, witnesses and the court,"
regardless "[w]hether a statement was made in or out of court, was on or off the record, or was
made orally or in writing." Frechtman v. Gutterrnan, 979 N. Y.S. 2d 58 (App. Div. 2014)
(quoting Sexter v. Warmflash, P.C. v. Margrabe, 828 N.Y.S. 2d 315 (App. Div. 2007)).
When the pre-litigation privilege is invoked in connection with an allegedly defamatory
statement made during pending or contemplated litigation, "any doubts are to be resolved in
favor of pertinence." Flomenhaft, 8 N. Y.S.3d at 164. "[T]he test to determine whether a
statement is pertinent to litigation is ""extremely liberal," such that the offending statement, to
be actionable, must have been 'outrageously out of context." Id. at 164-65 (emphasis supplied;
quoting Black v. Green Harbour Homeowners' Ass'n, 798 N. Y.S.2d 753 (App. Div. 2005), and
Martirano v. Frost, 255 N.E.2d 693 (1969)); Kirk, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 593.
In denying Ms. Maxwell's motion to dismiss the Complaint based on the pre-litigation
privilege, this Court limited its analysis of the privilege to whether under the Rule 12(b)(6)
standard plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded that the January 2 and 4 statements were made with
actual malice. Doc.37 at 18-19. The Court's Rule 12(b)(6) analysis does not bear on the question
presented here, for two reasons.
Under the "substantive law"28 actual malice is not relevant to the pre-litigation defense.
The New York Court of Appeals in Khalil held that to prevail on the pre-litigation privilege the
defendant need only establish one element: the allegedly defamatory statement at issue was
28 Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.
34


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page42 of 77
"pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation." 28 N.E.3d at 16. Upon establishing that element,
summary judgment for the defendant is required. See id. Additionally, this is a summary
judgment proceeding. Plaintiff cannot rely on the allegations of her Complaint. Evidence is
required.
The following evidence is not in dispute. By January 2015 Ms. Maxwell had retained
British Solicitor Philip Barden to represent and advise her in connection with plaintiff's
publication in the British press of salacious, defamatory allegations of criminal sexual abuse
during the period 1999-2002. EXHIBIT K 19 8-10. Mr. Barden in turn engaged UK press agent
Ross Gow. Id. 9 9. Mr. Barden prepared the January 2015 statement and instructed Mr. Gow to
transmit it via email to members of the UK media who had made inquiry about the allegations in
the joinder motion. Id. " 10.
Mr. Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely
to disseminate information to the media. Id. 9 15. This is why he intentionally did not request
that Mr. Gow or any other public relations specialist prepare the statement. Id. Instead, Mr. Gow
served as his conduit to the media representatives who had requested a response to the joinder
motion allegations and who Mr. Barden believed might republish those allegations. Id.
Mr. Barden had two purposes in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated
to those media representatives. First, he wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's reputation
from the press's republication of plaintiff's false allegations. Id. 9 16. He believed these ends
could be accomplished by suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject
plaintiff's allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. Id. For example, he noted in the January 2015
statement that plaintiff's allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they are
"obvious lies" and therefore should not be "publicised as news." Id.
35


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page43 of 77
Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be "a shot across the bow" of
the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations without
conducting any inquiry of their own. Id. | 17. This was the purpose of repeatedly stating that
plaintiff's allegations were "defamatory." Id. The statement was intended as a cease and desist
letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the seriousness with which
Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false allegations and the legal
indefensibility of their own conduct. Id.
At the time Mr. Barden directed the issuance of the statement, he was contemplating
litigation against the media-recipients as an additional means to mitigate and prevent harm to
Ms. Maxwell. Id. 1 28. Toward this end, he prepared the statement so that it made clear
Ms. Maxwell "strongly denie[d] the allegations of an unsavoury nature," declared the
republications of the allegations to be false, gave the press-recipients notice that the
republications of the allegations "are defamatory," and informed them that Ms. Maxwell was
"reserv[ing] her right to seek redress." Id. | 30. In any such UK defamation, or other related,
action Ms. Giuffre would be a defendant or a witness. Id. 1 29.
The question presented is whether Mr. Barden's statement, which he directed to be sent
to various media representatives, is "pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation," Khalil, 28
N.E.3d at 16.
The requirement of "good faith" anticipated litigation is intended to prevent attorneys (or
their agents) from "bully[ing], harass[ing], or intimidat[ing] their client's adversaries by
threatening baseless litigation or by asserting unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact,
in violation of counsel's ethical obligations," id. at 19. The statement Mr. Barden prepared and
caused to be issued was not intended to bully, harass or intimidate the press-recipients, i.e., the
36


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page44 of 77
potential defendants in an action by Ms. Maxwell for defamation. See EXHIBIT K 99 26-30.
Nothing about the statement on its face suggested bullying, harassing or intimidating the press-
recipients (or anyone else). At the time Mr. Barden directed the issuance of the statement, he had
sufficient factual and legal grounds to pursue in good faith a defamation action against one or
more of the press-recipients for republishing plaintiff's allegations. See generally id. 191 8-30.
That the statement was directed at the press-recipients—which had republished plaintiff's
false allegations and was not directed at plaintiff is irrelevant to the absolute privilege
protecting pre-litigation communications. In International Publishing Concepts, LLC v.
Locatelli, letters and emails detailing likely litigation and an intent to sue were extended the
same pre-litigation privilege although sent to two non-parties who were only potentially affected
by the litigation or witnesses to it. See also Kirk, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 593 ("The privilege is broad,
and embraces anything that may possibly or plausibly be relevant to the litigation.") (internal
quotations omitted).
The only issue remaining is whether the statement was pertinent to the contemplated
litigation. Applying the "extremely liberal" test of pertinence, in which "any doubts are to be
resolved in favor of pertinence,"29 the court must decide whether the allegedly defamatory
statement is "outrageously out of context" in relation to the contemplated litigation. Flomenhaft,
8 N. Y.S.3d at 164-65 (internal quotations omitted). Nothing in the statement is "outrageously out
of context." Every statement was directly related to the press-recipients' republication of
plaintiff's false allegations against Ms. Maxwell.
The January 4 statement also is absolutely privileged. According to plaintiff,
Ms. Maxwell told a reporter on that date when asked to comment on plaintiff's joinder-motion
2º Flomenhaft, 8 N. Y. S.3d at 164 (internal quotations omitted).
37

allegations: "I am referring to the statement that was made." Doc.1 1 32. Assuming arguendo the
statement is defamatory,3° it is absolutely privileged since it simply refers to an absolutely
privileged statement. See, e.g., Klein, 29 A.D.2d at 420 (privilege protects communications
"between litigating parties"); Frechtman, 979 N. Y.S.2d at 63 (privilege protects communications
"made in or out of court, ... on or off the record, ... orally or in writing") (internal quotations
omitted).
Under these circumstances the pre-litigation privilege is absolute and "no cause of action
for defamation can be based on those statements," Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 16. The Court should
enter summary judgment on plaintiff's defamation claim.
IV. Ms. Maxwell's January 4, 2015, statement is nonactionable.
Plaintiff alleges that on January 4, 2015, a reporter approached Ms. Maxwell on a public
street in Manhattan and "asked Maxwell about Giuffre's allegations against Maxwell." Doc.1
1| 37. Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Maxwell responded with a single sentence: "'I am referring to the
statement that we made."" Id. According to plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell's statement was defamatory.
See id. 9| 37 & Count I 9 5, at 8. Judgment should enter against plaintiff as to Ms. Maxwell's
statement.
Adelson controls this portion of plaintiff's defamation claim. In Adelson a non-profit
organization during the 2012 presidential campaign published a statement on its website critical
of Sheldon Adelson, a wealthy Republican donor. The statement alleged Adelson had donated
"tainted" and "dirty" money to Governor Romney. Eight days later the organization withdrew
the statement from its website. On the same day it issued a press release explaining that although
3° As discussed in Argument IV, the January 4 statement is nonactionable.
38


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page46 of 77
it took down the statement,
"we stand by everything we said, which was sourced from current,
credible news accounts." 973 F. Supp. 2d at 474.
Adelson sued. He alleged that the statement was defamatory and that the press release
constituted a republication of the defamatory statement. This court held that the statement
contained only constitutionally protected opinion and was nonactionable. The court then rejected
the defamation claim based on republication: "[A] mere reference to another writing that
contains defamatory matter does not constitute an actionable repetition or republication." Id.
(quoting Goforth v. Avemco Life Ins. Co., 368 F.2d 25, 28 n. 7 (4th Cir.1966))). This is the settled
rule. See In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC, 690 F.3d 161, 175 (3d Cir. 2012), as corrected
(Oct. 25, 2012) ("under traditional principles of republication, a mere reference to an article,
regardless how favorable it is as long as it does not restate the defamatory material, does not
republish the material"); Salyer v. S. Poverty Law Ctr., Inc., 701 F. Supp. 2d 912, 916 (W.D. Ky.
2009) ('[T]he common thread of traditional republication is that it presents the material, in its
entirety, before a new audience. A mere reference to a previously published article does not do
that.").
Ms. Maxwell's one-sentence response that merely referenced an earlier statement is
nonactionable. This Court should enter partial summary judgment on the defamation claim to the
extent it is based on Ms. Maxwell's response.
V. The defamation claim should be dismissed because the publication is substantially
true.
'[A] statement is substantially true if the statement would not "have a different effect on
the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced."" Franklin v.
Daily Holdings, Inc., 21 N. Y.S.3d 6, 12 (App. Div. 2015) (quoting Biro v. Condé Nast, 883 F.
Supp. 2d 441, 458 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Jewell v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 23 F. Supp. 2d 348,
39


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page47 of 77
366 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (quoting Fleckenstein v. Friedman, 193 N.E. 537, 538 (1934))))). Indeed, it
is well settled in New York "that an alleged libel is not actionable if the published statement
could have produced no worse an effect on the mind of a reader than the truth pertinent to the
allegation." Id. (internal quotations omitted). "When the truth is so near to the facts as published
that fine and shaded distinctions must be drawn and words pressed out of their ordinary usage to
sustain a charge of libel, no legal harm has been done." Fleckenstein, 193 N.E. at 538.
For the reasons articulated in Argument VI, the January 2015 statement is substantially
true as matter of law.
VI. Plaintiff cannot establish actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.
A. Facts.
The following numbered facts are not in dispute and are sequentially numbered following
the undisputed facts cited earlier. See This Motion at 19 1-36.

43. Plaintiff freely and voluntarily contacted the police to come to her aid in 2001
and 2002 but never reported to them that she was Epstein's "sex slave." In August 2001 at
age 17, while living in the same apartment, plaintiff and Figueroa hosted a party with a number
of guests. EXHIBIT Z. During the party, according to plaintiff, someone entered plaintiff's room
and stole $500 from her shirt pocket. Id. Plaintiff contacted the police. She met and spoke with
police officers regarding the incident and filed a report. She did not disclose to the officer that
she was a "sex slave." A second time, in June 2002, plaintiff contacted the police to report that
her former landlord had left her belongings by the roadside and had lit her mattress on fire.
EXHIBIT AA. Again, plaintiff met and spoke with the law enforcement officers but did not
complain that she was the victim of any sexual trafficking or abuse or that she was then being
held as a "sex slave." Id.
44. From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein and Maxwell were almost
entirely absent from Florida on documented travel unaccompanied by Plaintiff. Flight logs
maintained by Epstein's private pilot Dave Rodgers evidence the substantial number of trips
away from Florida that Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Plaintiff, between August
2001 and September 2002. ExHIBIT BB. Rodgers maintained a log of all flights on which Epstein

freely traveled around the Palm Beach area in that vehicle. Id. In August 2002, Plaintiff acquired
a Dodge Dakota pickup truck from her father. EXHIBIT P at 67-68. Figueroa used that vehicle in
a series of crimes before and after Plaintiff left for Thailand. Id.; ExHIBIT FF.
46. Plaintiff held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002. During 2001 and 2002, plaintiff
was gainfully employed at several jobs. She worked as a waitress at Mannino's Restaurant, at
TGIFriday's restaurant (aka CCI of Royal Palm Inc.), and at Roadhouse Grill. EXHIBIT R. She
also was employed at Courtyard Animal Hospital (aka Marc Pinkwasser DVM). Id.; EXHIBIT W.
47. In September 2002, Plaintiff traveled to Thailand to receive massage training
and while there, met her future husband and eloped with him. Plaintiff traveled to Thailand
in September 2002 to receive formal training as a masseuse. Figueroa drove her to the airport.
While there, she initially contacted Figueroa frequently, incurring a phone bill of $4,000.
EXHIBIT P at 35. She met Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and decided to marry him. She
thereafter ceased all contact with Figueroa from October 2002 until two days before Mr.
Figueroa's deposition in this matter in May 2016. Id. at 29, 37.
48. Detective Recarey's investigation of Epstein failed to uncover any evidence that
Ms. Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or
possession of child pornography. Joseph Recarey served as the lead detective from the Palm
Beach Police Department charged with investigating Jeffrey Epstein. EXHIBIT GG at 10. That
investigation commenced in 2005. Id. Recarey worked only on the Epstein case for an entire
year. Id. at 274. He reviewed previous officers' reports and interviews, conducted numerous
interviews of witnesses and alleged victims himself, reviewed surveillance footage of the Epstein

home, participated in and had knowledge of the search warrant executed on the Epstein home,
and testified regarding the case before the Florida state grand jury against Epstein. Id. at 212-15.
Detective Recarey's investigation revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever
mentioned Ms. Maxwell's name and she was never considered a suspect by the government. Id.
at 10-11, 177, 180-82, 187-96, 241-42, 278. None of Epstein's alleged victims said they had
seen Ms. Maxwell at Epstein's house, nor said they had been "recruited by her," nor paid any
money by her, nor told what to wear or how to act by her. Id. Indeed, none of Epstein's alleged
victims ever reported to the government they had met or spoken to Ms. Maxwell. Id. Maxwell
was not seen coming or going from the house during the law enforcement surveillance of
Epstein's home. Id. at 214-215. The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell and her name
was never mentioned before the grand jury. Id. at 203, 211. No property belonging to Maxwell,
including "sex toys" or "child pornography," was seized from Epstein's home during execution
of the search warrant. Id. at 257. Detective Recarey, when asked to describe "everything that you
believe you know about Ghislaine Maxwell's sexual trafficking conduct," replied, "I don't." Id.
at 278. He confirmed he has no knowledge about Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking anybody. Id.
at 278-79. Detective Recarey also has no knowledge of Plaintiff's conduct that is subject of this
lawsuit. Id. at 259-60.
49. No nude photograph of Plaintiff was displayed in Epstein's home. Epstein's
housekeeper, Juan Alessi, "never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. Epstein's
house." EXHIBIT HH at 9 17. Detective Recarey entered Epstein's home in 2002 to install
security cameras to catch a thief and did not observe any "child pornography" within the home,
including on Epstein's desk in his office. EXHIBIT GG at 289-90.
45


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page53 of 77
50. Plaintiff intentionally destroyed her "journal" and "dream journal" regarding
her "memories" of this case in 2013 while represented by counsel. Plaintiff drafted a
"journal" describing individuals to whom she claims she was sexually trafficked as well as her
memories and thoughts about her experiences with Epstein. EXHIBIT II at 64-65, 194; EXHIBIT N
at 205-08. In 2013, she and her husband created a bonfire in her backyard in Florida and burned
the journal together with other documents in her possession. Id. Plaintiff also kept a "dream
journal" regarding her thoughts and memories that she possessed in January 2016. ExIBIt II at
194-96. To date, Plaintiff cannot locate the "dream journal." Id.31
51. Plaintiff publicly peddled her story beginning in 2011. Plaintiff granted journalist
Sharon Churcher extensive interviews that resulted in seven (7) widely distributed articles from
March 2011 through January 2015. Churcher regularly communicated with plaintiff and her
"attorneys or other agents" from "early 2011" to "the present day." See Doc.216 11 2-11 and
referenced exhibits; Doc.261-1 to 216-8, incorporated by reference. Plaintiff received
approximately $160,000 for her stories and pictures that were published by many news
organizations. Ехнівіт N at 247-48.
52. Plaintiff drafted a 144-page purportedly autobiographical book manuscript in
2011 which she actively sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous with her Churcher
interviews, plaintiff drafted a book manuscript which purported to document plaintiff's
experiences as a teenager in Florida, including her interactions with Epstein and Maxwell.
EXHIBIT KK. Plaintiff communicated with literary agents, ghost writers and potential
independent publishers in an effort to get her book published. She generated marketing materials
31 Defendant has moved for sanctions against plaintiff premised on her admitted
destruction of this evidence. Doc.509-510.
46


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page54 of 77
and circulated those along with book chapters to numerous individuals associated with
publishing and the media.
53. Plaintiff's publicly filed "lurid" CVRA pleadings initiated a media frenzy and
generated highly publicized litigation between her lawyers and Alan Dershowitz. On
December 30, 2014, plaintiff, through counsel, publicly filed a joinder motion that contained her
"lurid allegations" about Ms. Maxwell and many others, including Alan Dershowitz, Prince
Andrew, Jean-Luc Brunel. The joinder motion was followed by a "corrected" motion (EXHIBIT
D) and two further declarations in January and February 2015, which repeated many of
plaintiff's claims. These CVRA pleadings generated a media maelstrom and spawned highly
publicized litigation between plaintiff's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz.
After plaintiff publicly alleged Mr. Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz vigorously
defended himself in the media. He called plaintiff a liar and accused her lawyers of unethical
conduct. In response, attorneys Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz who counterclaimed.
This litigation, in turn, caused additional media attention by national and international media
organizations. See Doc.363 at 363-1 through 363-14.
54. Plaintiff formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to attract publicity and
speak out on a public controversy. In 2014, plaintiff, with the assistance of the same counsel,
formed a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to plaintiff, the purpose of
the organization is to promote plaintiff's professed cause against sex slavery. The stated goal of
her organization is to help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically
experienced by victims of sexual abuse. EXHIBIT LL. Plaintiff attempts to promote Victims
Refuse Silence at every opportunity. EXHIBIT MM at 17-18. For example, plaintiff participated
47


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page55 of 77
in an interview in New York with ABC to promote the charity and to get her mission out to the
public. Id. at 28.
B. Plaintiff carries the burden of proving actual malice by clear and convincing
evidence.
In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964), the Supreme Court
recognized that our country has made a "profound national commitment to the principle that
debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." The overriding
importance of that commitment led to the Court's holding that "neither factual error nor
defamatory content, nor a combination of the two, sufficed to remove the First Amendment
shield," Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 535 (2001), from speech relating to public officials
and public figures. See, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 345 (1974). Under the
First Amendment of the Constitution and Article I, Section 8, of the New York Constitution, in
defamation actions by public officials and public figures and in defamation actions concerning
matters of public concern, the plaintiff must prove that the allegedly defamatory statement was
made with "actual malice." See, e.g., id.; Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767,
776-77 (1986); Huggins v. Moore, 726 N.E.2d 456, 460 (N.Y. 1999); McGill v. Parker, 582
N.Y.S.2d 91, 97 (App. Div. 1992).
As the Supreme Court has noted, the term "actual malice" can be confusing because in
the First Amendment context "it has nothing to do with bad motive or ill will." Harte-Hanks
Communic'ns, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 666 n.7 (1989). Instead proof of actual malice
requires evidence that the publication contains a "material"32 false statement of fact that was
made "with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or
32 Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp. v. Hoeper, 134 S. Ct. 852, 861 (2014) ("minor
inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as 'the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous
charge be justified") (internal quotations and brackets omitted).
48


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page56 of 77
not it was true." Id. at 667 (internal quotations omitted). Reckless disregard means the defendant
made the false publication "with a high degree of awareness of probable falsity" or "entertained
serious doubts as to the truth of [the] publication." Id. (internal quotations omitted).
In a defamation action, a plaintiff will be required to prove actual malice in two different
and independent contexts: a defamation action in which the plaintiff is a public figure, and a
defamation action in which the defendant asserts the privilege of reply.
The defamation plaintiff at trial and in summary judgment proceedings must prove her
case by clear and convincing evidence.
C. Plaintiff is a public figure who must prove actual malice.
Public figures include those who have "thrust themselves to the forefront of particular
public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved... [T]hey invite
attention and comment." Gertz, 418 U.S. at 345. The essential element for a finding that a person
is a public figure is that she has "taken an affirmative step to attract public attention," has
"strived to achieve a measure of public acclaim." James v. Gannett Co., 353 N.E.2d 834, 876
(N.Y. 1976).
In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), the United States Supreme
Court held that, in cases involving public officials, the interests of an individual are trumped by
society's interest in promoting free press discussion of matters of general concern. Biro v. Condé
Naste, 963 F. Supp. 2d 255, 269 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). Thus, the Court held that a public official
alleging defamation must establish that a falsehood has been published with "actual malice."
Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 279-80; accord, Lerman v. Flynt Dist. Co., Inc., 745 F.3d 123, 136 (2d Cir.
1984); Biro, 963 F. Supp. 2d at 269. Subsequently, the Supreme Court extended this standard to
all public figures, Curtis Publ'g Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967), and decided in Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974), that individuals that "are not public figures for all purposes
49


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page57 of 77
may still be public figures with respect to a particular controversy." Contemporary Mission, Inc.
v. N.Y. Times Co., 842 F.2d 612, 617 (2d Cir. 1988).
As the Second Circuit has observed, the reason for distinguishing between private and
public figures in defamation claims flows from the recognition of two things: First, "that private
figure are more vulnerable to injury from defamation, because public figures have greater access
to the media and thus are in a better position to contradict a lie or correct an error."
Contemporary Mission, Inc., 842 F.2d at 619-20. Second, "and more important, public figures
generally 'have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory
falsehood concerning them."" Id. at 620 (quoting N.Y. Times, 418 U.S. at 344-45) (emphasis
added).
In the Second Circuit, to establish that a plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure, a
defendant must prove that she:
1. successfully invited public attention to [her] views in an effort to influence others
prior to the incident that is the subject of litigation;
2. voluntarily injected [her]self into a public controversy related to the subject of the
litigation;
3. assumed a position of prominence in the public controversy; and
4. maintained regular and continuing access to the media.
Lerman, 745 F.2d at 136-37; accord, Contemporary Mission, Inc., 842 F.2d at 617; Biro, 963 F.
Supp. 2d at 270. Statements regarding a limited purpose public figure are subject to enhanced
protection only if relevant to the public figure's involvement in a given controversy. Biro, 963 F.
Supp.2d at 270-71 (citing Faigin v. Kelly, 978 F. Supp. 420, 426 (D. N.H. 1997)). "Yet, once a
plaintiff is deemed a limited purpose public figure, courts allow the heightened protections to
sweep broadly, covering all statements by defendants that are not 'wholly unrelated to the
controversy.'" Biro, 963 F. Supp. 2d at 271 (quoting Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publ'ns, Inc., 626
50


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page58 of 77
F.2d 1287, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). The law requires only that "the statement need be no more
than generally related to a dispute in issue to qualify for protection." Robert D. Sack, Sack on
Defamation: Libel, Slander, and Related Problems ("SACK ON DEFAMATION") § 5:3.3 (4th ed.
2015).
The question whether a plaintiff is a public figure is a question of law for the court to
decide. Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enters. Inc., 209 F.3d 163, 176-77 (2d Cir. 2000); accord Biro,
963 F. Supp. 2d at 270.
1. Plaintiff successfully invited public attention to influence others.
The record amply demonstrates that plaintiff invited public attention to herself and her
views regarding the Plaintiff's alleged desire to draw attention to the issue of her purported sex
slavery.
Beginning in at least 2011, the Plaintiff met with Sharon Churcher to promote her cause
and economic interests. According to Ms. Churcher, the Plaintiff granted Ms. Churcher extensive
interviews that resulted in 7 widely distributed articles from March 2011 through January 2015.
According to Ms. Churcher, she regularly communicated with the Plaintiff and her "attorneys or
other agents" from "early 2011" to "the present day." See Doc.216 19 2-11 and referenced
exhibits; Docs.261-1 to 216-8, incorporated by reference. Plaintiff was amply compensated for
this "public attention" and received approximately $160,000 for her stories. and pictures that
were published by many news organizations. EXHIBIT N at 247-248. Plaintiff had a contract with
the news organizations, The Mail on Sunday.
Plaintiff, in addition to selling this story to the media, again thrust herself into the
public's attention when she sought to join the ongoing CVRA litigation against Jeffrey Epstein in
the United States District Court in Florida. The Plaintiff, through the same lawyers in this matter,
publicly filed a joinder motion that was the equivalent of a press release. The unnecessary and
51


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page59 of 77
lurid allegations were ultimately stricken by the Court but accomplished the desired result for the
Plaintiff, more public attention. The CVRA pleading created a media frenzy and spawned highly
publicized litigation between Plaintiff's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz.
After the Plaintiff publicly alleged Mr. Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz
vigorously defended himself in the media. He called the Plaintiff a liar and accused her lawyers
of unethical conduct. In response, the lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, sued Dershowitz who
counterclaimed. This litigation, in turn, caused additional media attention by national and
international media organizations. See Doc.363 at 363-1 thorough 363-14 and accompanying
exhibits.
In addition, plaintiff claims to have established a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse
Silence, the purpose of which was to promote plaintiff's professed cause against sex slavery.
In paragraphs 23 through 26 of her complaint in this matter she makes the following
admissions on this issue:
• Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein's many victims, Giuffre believed that she
should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who
had also suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse. Id. 23
• On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims Refuse
Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation. Id. 24
• Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues
to be, to help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically
experienced by victims of sexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional
life to helping victims of sex trafficking. Id. 25
• On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously
filed by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein's non-
prosecution agreement by filing her own joinder motion. Id. 26
52


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page60 of 77
In sum, the record includes ample evidence of plaintiff's efforts to garner public attention
in order to influence others and the success of those efforts.
2. Plaintiff voluntarily injected herself into public controversies related to the
subject of this litigation.
The second prong of the Lerman test requires an examination of whether plaintiff
voluntarily injected herself into a public controversy related to the subject of the litigation. The
Second Circuit has held that the term should be defined broadly to mean "any topic upon which
sizeable segments of society have different, strongly held views." Lerman, 745 F.2d at 138; see
also Biro, 963 F. Supp. 2d at 272 ("A public controversy is simply 'any topic upon which
sizeable segments of society have different, strongly held views, even if the topic does 'not
involve political debate or criticism of public officials.'") (quoting Lerman, 745 F.2d at 138)
(alteration omitted). The public controversy requirement, however, is not necessarily limited to
what would be considered "a classic debate." SACK ON DEFAMATION § 5:3.11[B]. "An
investigation into alleged corruption or drug dealing, for example, could meet the test." Id.
As demonstrated by the Declaration of Ms. Churcher, the articles attached to the
declaration, and the joinder motion filed by plaintiff in the CVRA litigation and the litigation
initiated by her lawyers there can be no doubt that the plaintiff's actions were voluntary and that
she injected herself into this "public controversy." Indeed, it is clear that plaintiff created this
"public controversy."
3. Plaintiff assumed a position of prominence in the public controversies.
The third relevant factor focuses on whether plaintiff has voluntarily assumed a sufficient
degree of prominence in the controversies at issue. Plaintiff sold and published her story. She
publicly sought to join the CVRA litigation. She established a non-profit organization, the
53


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page61 of 77
mission of which is purportedly to "spread the word for victims of human trafficking". EXHIBIT
MM at 17; see also EXHIBIT LL.
According to Brittany Henderson, the Rule 30(b)(6) designee of VRS, plaintiff has
"continued to try to promote Victims Refuse Silence at every possible chance she gets ..."
EXHIBIT MM at 17-18. Plaintiff participated in an interview in New York with ABC in "the
beginning of 2015," id. at 27, so that she could "promote the charity, so that she could start
getting her mission out to the public." Id. at 28. Having affirmatively injected herself into the
public spotlight in connection with these issues, plaintiff cannot now be heard to argue that this
Lerman factor has not been satisfied. Cf. Contemporary Mission, 842 F.2d at 618-19 (finding the
plaintiffs' assertion that they have assumed a private life was "belied by the fact that they
continued to thrust themselves into the public eye" through their conduct on behalf of a non-for-
profit organization).
4. Plaintiff has maintained regular and continuing access to the media.
Plaintiff has had substantial access to the media. Ms. Churcher has answered every call or
email sent by plaintiff. Plaintiff's lawyers have regularly communicated with the media. Plaintiff
and her lawyers have been interviewed by numerous major media organizations.
Accordingly, the First Amendment requires that public figures like plaintiff claiming
defamation must establish actual malice—actual and material falsity or a high degree of
awareness of probable falsity by clear and convincing evidence. E.g., Masson v. New Yorker
Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 510 (1991).
D. Plaintiff must also prove actual malice to overcome the defenses of reply and
pre-litigation privilege.
The qualified privilege of reply to a defamatory attack is a complete defense to a claim of
defamation. Shenkman v. O'Malley, 157 N. Y.S.2d 290, 294, 297 (App. Div. 1956). The defense
54


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page62 of 77
is available to a person "who has been defamed in the first instance," here, Ms. Maxwell, and
"who, in response to the attack, responds in kind." Id. The privilege of the initially-attacked
person (Ms. Maxwell) includes in rebuttal of the initial attack the right to speak the truth, but the
right to rebut is not confined to the truth or to mere denial:
This defense of reply is material, of course, only where the response in kind is
defamatory. The injury, if any, to plaintiff is excused, because it is the plaintiff
who started the altercation.
It is a contradiction in terms to say that the one attacked is a privileged only to
speak the truth, and not to make a counter attack, or that legitimate self-defense
consists only in a denial of the charge or a statement of what is claimed to be the
truth respecting its subject-matter.
Id. (emphasis supplied; quoting Collier v. Postum Cereal Co., 134 N. Y.S. 847, 853 (1" Dep't
1912)); see generally Restatement of the Law of Torts (Second) § 594 cmt. k (1977) (noting that
to protect her reputation from attack by another person, she is conditionally privileged to publish
defamatory matter about her attacker reasonably believed necessary to defend her reputation,
"including the statement that [her] accuser is an unmitigated liar").
A defendant asserting the defense of reply need only establish she has been attacked with
a defamatory statement. See id. at 297. Beginning no later than 2009 plaintiff attacked
Ms. Maxwell with defamatory statements. In 2014, plaintiff knew the press was giving extensive
coverage to, and scrutinizing all filings in, the Crime Victim's Rights Act case pending in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and in plaintiff's 2009 civil
action against Mr. Epstein. Knowing this, plaintiff repeatedly filed papers in court alleging that
Ms. Maxwell participated as a "recruiter" in a "sex trafficking" scheme operated by Mr. Epstein.
E.g., Exhibit D. In 2011, plaintiff granted "exclusive" interviews to the British tabloid press
during which she repeated her false allegations against Ms. Maxwell and also alleged that as part
of the "sex trafficking" scheme she had sex with numerous prominent public figures, including
55


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page63 of 77
Prince Andrew and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. EXHIBIT A. The false allegations
against Ms. Maxwell constituted defamation per se.
A plaintiff may defeat a qualified privilege only by proving actual malice. See, e.g., Kane
v. Orange Cnty. Publ'ns, 649 N.Y.S.2d 23, 26 (App. Div. 1996) (qualified privilege of reply);
see generally Gertz, 418 U.S. at 323; Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, § 594 cmt. b.
E. The January 2015 statement was substantially true, and plaintiff cannot
produce clear and convincing evidence of its falsity.
The January 2015 statement accurately and properly denies the factual assertions
regarding Ms. Maxwell contained within plaintiff's joinder motion that had been issued two days
prior to which it responded. With respect to each claim in the joinder motion that concerns Ms.
Maxwell, the evidence elicited through discovery undercuts any evidence - clear and convincing
or otherwise - that plaintiff may proffer to buttress her false allegations.
1. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that Ms. Maxwell met
Plaintiff when Plaintiff was 15 years old in 1999.
Plaintiff's relative youth at the time of her initial contact with Epstein and Maxwell forms
the core of Plaintiff's story, in her joinder motion and in the press, that she was an underage
victim of sexual slavery. Plaintiff has made a point of mentioning her age of 15, in the year 1999,
as the starting point for her "four years" of "sex slavery" at every opportunity. The young age no
doubt heightens the offensiveness of the claimed abusive conduct and also supplies enough time
to allow for the "thousands" of times she was purportedly abused and the numerous opportunities
for her to be trafficked to countless famous individuals. Reiterating this point in the joinder
motion, plaintiff asserted again that she met Ms. Maxwell in the year 1999 when she was a mere
15 years old. EXHIBIT D at 3.
As she now admits and her employment records confirm, plaintiff did not actually meet
Ms. Maxwell or Epstein until the year 2000. Plaintiff acknowledges that she did not meet Ms.
56


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page64 of 77
Maxwell until she worked at the Mar-A-Lago as a spa attendant, and she confirms that she
obtained that job with the assistance of her father who already was employed as a maintenance
worker at the club. Records subpoenaed from Mar-A-Lago reflect that plaintiff's father
commenced employment on April 11, 2000. EXHIBIT S. Additionally, they show that plaintiff
terminated in the year 2000. Id. Finally, plaintiff's social security report confirms plaintiff's
Mar-a-lago employment was confined to calendar year 2000. EXHIBIT R. Faced with
overwhelming proof that her claims of meeting Ms. Maxwell at the age of 15 in the year 1999
were false, plaintiff finally conceded as much at her deposition on May 3, 2016. EXHIBIT N at 25-
28. She also confessed that she did not spend her "sweet 16'h" birthday with Ms. Maxwell, as
detailed in her book manuscript and in the press. Compare EXHIBIT N at 101-02 with EXHIBIT
KK at Giuffre04173 ("I spent my sweet 16" birthday on his island in the Caribbean next to 'St.
James Isle' he liked to call it 'Little St. Jeff's', his ego was as enormous as his appetite for
fornicating. I was given a birthday cake and a new collection of designer make-up from London.
Ghislaine made a joke after I blew out my array of candles and said, 'I'd be soon getting too old
for Jeffrey's taste, and soon they'd have to trade me in.""); Paul Lewis, "Jeffrey Epstein: Inside
the Decade of Scandal Entangling Prince Andrew," The Guardian (Jan. 10, 2015)33.
Yet, even after conceding she was off by a year, plaintiff persists in suggesting that she
must have been a mere "16 year old" when she worked at Mar-a-Lago and met Ms. Maxwell. It
was, she testified, a "summer job" for which she had taken a break from school, and she did not
turn 17 until later that summer on August 9, 2000. EXHIBIT N at 25-28, 57,104, 113. But the
Mar-a-Lago documents conclusively disprove this claim: the spa where plaintiff worked closes
every year from Mother's Day until November 1. ExHIBIT U at Mar-a-Lago0212 ("The club
33 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/jeffrey-epstein-decade-scandal-
prince-andrew (last visited Jan. 6, 2017).
57


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page65 of 77
never shuts down from November 1 to Mother's Day."). Spa attendants such as plaintiff are
"seasonal" employees. Id. Indeed, the spa advertises for its new employees in local newspapers
in the fall of every year. ExHIBIT V. Even plaintiff's father - a long time employee of Mar-a-
Lago -- described the seasonal nature of the club during his deposition: "[Plaintiff's
employment] was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there
year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it's like snowbirds, you know,
summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida....[The season is] probably
from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess." EXHIBIT T at 72. With the spa
closed from Mother's Day to November 1, plaintiff could not have had a "summer job" and
could not have worked at Mar-a-Lago until November 2000, at the earliest, when she was over
17 years old.
In sum, Plaintiff's claim in the Joinder Motion that she met Ghislaine Maxwell in 1999
when she was 15 years old is a false statement. Therefore, the January 2015 statement calls the
allegations against her "untrue" was factually accurate.
2. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that Ms. Maxwell "regularly
participate[d] in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors" and that "the
Government knows" such fact.
The January 2015 statement also accurately denied plaintiff's joinder motion allegation
that "it became known to the government that Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein's
sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane Doe #3." EXHIBIT D at 3. Ms. Maxwell did not
"regularly participate in in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors" as confirmed by the lead
Palm Beach Detective, Joseph Recarey. Det. Recarey confirmed that none of the alleged Epstein
victims ever mentioned Ms. Maxwell's name, either in reports he reviewed or in interviews he
conducted. None of the alleged victims said they had been "recruited," paid or exploited by Ms.
Maxwell. EXHIBIT GG at 10-11, 177, 180-82, 187-96, 241-42, 278. He verified that the twenty-
58


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page66 of 77
two page Palm Beach Police Department affidavit does not mention Ms. Maxwell's name once
(id. at 177), and she was never considered a suspect and she was never mentioned in the grand
jury testimony. Id. at 203. Ms. Maxwell was not seen coming or going from the house during
any of the Palm Beach Police Department's surveillance of Epstein's home. Id. at 214-15. None
of her property was seized from Epstein's home. Id. at 257. In sum, Det. Recarey denied that
knowing anything "about Ghislaine Maxwell's sexual trafficking conduct." Id. at 278. He
confirmed he has no knowledge that Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking "anybody." Id. at 278-79.
Likewise, he has no knowledge of Plaintiff's conduct that is subject of this lawsuit. Id. at 259-60.
Plaintiff thus has uncovered no evidence that the "government" came to "know" that Maxwell
participated in sexual exploitation of Jane Doe #3, i.e., Plaintiff. Plaintiff has not and cannot
present clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate the falsity of Ms. Maxwell's denial.
3. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that "with [Ms. Maxwell's]
assistance, [Epstein] converted [Plaintif] into what is commonly referred to
as a 'sex slave.'"
Plaintiff claimed in the joinder motion that Ms. Maxwell helped Epstein transform her
into a "sex slave" as that term is "commonly" used, yet the incontrovertible evidence establishes
the opposite. A "slave" as defined by Merriam-Webster is a "person held in servitude as the
chattel of another." Oxford Dictionary defines "slave" as a "person who is the legal property of
another and is forced to obey them." Common definitions of "sex slave" include a person who is
confined and is raped, sexually abused or prostituted. See "Sex Slave," Free Dictionary, located
at http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sex+slave(last visited Jan. 5, 2017) (underlining supplied).
Plaintiff, however, was far from confined or the legal property of another.
Throughout 2000, 2001 and 2002, Plaintiff enjoyed complete freedom of movement and
choice. She had a car and then a pickup truck she shared with Figueroa. ExHIBIT P at 67.. She
traveled freely to and from multiple jobs working as a waitress, bird aviaries, veterinarian
59


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page67 of 77
hospital, Neiman Marcus, Oasis Outsourcing and Southeast Employee Management Company.
ExHIBIT R. Plaintiff enrolled in school in June 2000 before she met Maxwell or Epstein and
continued her enrollment throughout 2000, 2001 and until March 2002. EXHIBIT O. She worked
at multiple restaurants and the animal hospital in 2002. EXHIBIT R. She came and went from her
apartment, moved to a new apartment and then moved in with Figueroa's family. She held
parties at her apartment with Figueroa and other friends. EXHIBIT Z. When something did not go
well, she called the police and filed police reports, without mentioning anything about captivity,
confinement or forced sexual exploitation or trafficking, much less "sex slavery." Id. and
EXHIBIT AA. She had her own money, paid her rent, and bought a vehicle. To Figueroa, she
seemed "excited" about meeting famous people and discussed it so much that he tuned it out.
EXHIBIT P at 125-26. By any commonly understood definition of sex slavery, Plaintiff did not
match the description.
Witness testimony and documentary evidence demonstrate the absence of substantial
truth to Plaintiff's claim that Maxwell assisted Epstein in converting her into what is commonly
referred to as a "sex slave." The January 2015 statement's denial of that claim cannot therefore
be defamatory.
4. The January 2015 statement accurately reported that Plaintiff alleged
"sexual relations" with Professor Dershowitz which he denied.
The January 2015 statement accurately reports that "now it is alleged that Alan
Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with [Plaintiff], which he denies." The
joinder motion made such a claim and Professor Dershowitz publicly and vehemently denied any
such sexual contact. See, e.g., Dershowitz Denies Sex Charge, JTA (Jan. 2, 2015) ("Dershowitz
60


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page68 of 77
declared 'totally, unequivocally and completely false' allegations that he had sex with the former
staffer for investor Jeffrey Epstein."). 34
Professor Dershowitz has gone beyond a simple denial: he has sworn, repeatedly and in
almost every conceivable forum, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and
Good Morning America, that he never had any sexual contact with Plaintiff and never met her.
As he set forth in this case in his Declaration in Support of Motion to Intervene, Plaintiff never
mentioned his name during her weeklong 2011 interview with journalist Sharon Churcher.
Doc. 363. It was only after Churcher suggested to Plaintiff that she "must have" met Dershowitz
because "we all know he's a pedo, though we have no proof of that" that Plaintiff then included
Dershowitz in her book manuscript, not as a perpetrator of hers, but as someone she had "met"
while with Epstein. Id. The CVRA joinder motion more than three years later was the first time
plaintiff publicized her remarkable claim that she had been sexually trafficked to Dershowitz on
"numerous occasions" "while she was a minor," in Florida, private planes, in New York, New
Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. ExHIBIT D.
Dershowitz, in his own subsequent defamation action against plaintiff's attorneys
Edwards and Cassell, produced approximately 10,000 pages of documents capturing his travels
during the 1999-2002 time frame, none of which coincided with Plaintiff's story. For example,
Dershowitz demonstrated that the only time he visited Epstein's home in the U.S. Virgin Islands
he was accompanied by his wife and his 12 year old daughter. Plaintiff, on the other hand,
produced no records demonstrating that any portion of her allegation against him is true. For
example, she claimed one sexual encounter occurred on a private plane on which she traveled

Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page69 of 77
with Professor Dershowitz. ExHIBIT Il at 85. None of the flight logs reveal a flight with the two
of them as passengers. EXHIBIT BB. Another time, plaintiff claims, she and Epstein flew together
to Boston and she engaged in sexual relations with Professor Dershowitz in the backseat of a
limousine between the airport and his home with another female and Epstein next to them.
ExHIBIT II at 110-15. No flight logs document any trip with Epstein and plaintiff to Boston and
plaintiff cannot recall the other female in the car. EXHIBIT Il at 113.
Professor Dershowitz has signed affidavits, provided sworn deposition testimony and
sworn pleadings, offered to take a lie detector test, offered to waive the statute of limitations as
to himself, and given countless broadcast and news interviews disclaiming any sexual contact
with Plaintiff and calling her an outright "liar. "35 The January 2015 statement recounting the
allegation against him and his denial is substantially true.
5. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that Ms. Maxwell created
and distributed child pornography and that the Government knows of and
possesses such child pornography.
Plaintiff's next assertion regarding Maxwell in the joinder motion was that "Maxwell also
took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including
Jane Doe #3," and that Maxwell "shared these photographs (which constituted child pornography
under applicable federal laws) with Epstein." EXHIBIT D at 4-5. Plaintiff continued: the
"Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these
photographs." Id. Yet again, the evidence demonstrates the falsity of Plaintiff's claim.
Detective Recarey testified that none of Epstein's alleged victims even mentioned Ms.
Maxwell, much less claimed that she had taken naked photographs of them. ExHIBIT GG at 180-
82, 187-96, 241-42, 278. Recarey also denied that any evidence belonging to Ms. Maxwell was
35 Perhaps most telling, Plaintiff and her phalanx of attorneys have never sued
Mr. Dershowitz for his many vociferous attacks on her credibility.
62


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page70 of 77
seized from Epstein's home during the execution of the search warrant, which would include any
"child pornography" reportedly created by her. Id. at 257. Detective Recarey who had entered
Epstein's home in 2002 to install security cameras to catch a thief did not observe any "child
pornography" within the home, including on Epstein's desk where Plaintiff alleges he kept such
a nude photograph of herself. Id. at 289-90. And Epstein's housekeeper, Juan Alessi, swore that
he "never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. Epstein's house," EXHIBIT HH at 9 17,
contradicting Plaintiff's claims that nude photographs of her were prominently displayed
throughout all of Epstein's homes.
No sexually explicit photographs of Plaintiff were ever produced in discovery in this case
or subpoenaed by Plaintiff from any governmental agency. Plaintiff has presented no evidence
the government "possesses" any such photographs or indeed ever became "aware of" them.
6. January 2015 statement accurately denied Maxwell acted as "madame" for
Epstein to traffic Plaintiff to the rich and famous.
Finally, in the joinder motion, Plaintiff asserted that Ms. Maxwell had "facilitated" sexual
abuse "by acting as a 'madame' for Epstein, thereby assisting in internationally trafficking Jane
Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual purposes." Plaintiff has utterly failed to
substantiate her allegation.
Not a single "other young girl" made a claim that Maxwell, or even Epstein for that
matter, trafficked them to a third-person for commercial sexual acts. Detective Recarey
confirmed that he had no knowledge of Ghislaine Maxwell sexually trafficking anyone. EXHIBIT
GG at 278-79. He also confirmed that not a single one of the alleged victims of Epstein ever
claimed to have any sexual contact with any man other than Epstein, or that they were sent to
another location to have sex with another man or to give a massage to another man. Id. at 300-
02. None of the other alleged victims of Epstein ever claimed to have gone on his plane with him


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page71 of 77
or to have had sexual acts with him on his plane. Id. at 302-04. None claimed they had gone to
New York with him and stayed in his residence. Id. at 304-05. Plaintiff, it appears, is the only
alleged victim of Epstein who claims she was the subject of such trafficking, yet even she has
retracted, amended, and withdrawn many of her allegations, thus rendering (by her own
admission) such claim substantially untrue.
Foreign Presidents. Upon questioning under oath, Plaintiff admitted that she had never
even met a "foreign president," much less ever been sexually trafficked to one or to the multiple
"foreign presidents" referenced in the joinder motion.
Q: The reference there to foreign presidents, do you see that?
A: Yes.
Q: You were sexually trafficked to foreign presidents?
A: No.
Q: So that's not true, you were not sexually trafficked to foreign presidents?
A: I don't know what foreign presidents you're talking about.
Q: Have you ever been sexually trafficked to any foreign president?
[Objection interposed by Ms. McCawley; Special Master overruled]
A: I understand well-known prime ministers and other world leaders; as far as
foreign presidents, I'm not too sure, I don't know.
Q: Have you ever met any foreign presidents?
A: Foreign presidents as in overseas?
Q: Sure, okay, overseas.
A: No.
Q: Have you ever met any foreign presidents from countries not overseas such as
Canada or Mexico?
A: No.
Q: So you were not sexually trafficked to any foreign presidents, is that correct?
A: As far as I know right now, yes.
64


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page72 of 77
Q: It's correct that you were not sexually trafficked to them, right?
A: You've asked me this three times and I'm telling you.
EXHIBIT II at 10-12. Indeed, Plaintiff became frustrated by what she perceived as the third time
she was asked the question, each time denying that she had met a foreign president or been
sexually trafficked to one, clearly indicating that she understood the question, had answered it in
the negative and did not want to be re-asked the question again.36 Notably, not a single "foreign
president" is listed as a witness with knowledge of Plaintiff's claims in her Rule 26 disclosures.
"Well-known prime minister." Plaintiff also has failed to establish any evidence to
support her fantastical claim that she was sexually trafficked to a "well-known prime minister."
When questioned, she refused to disclose the identity of the prime minister, even with the
protection of a protective order. ExHIBIT Il at 12. She has not produced photographs of her with
any well-known prime minister, nor any flight log showing a well-known prime minister on
Epstein's airplane. She has not identified herself as being in any location with a well-known
prime minister, nor the date of any such encounter. The only evidence that Plaintiff has ever been
even in the company of a well-known prime minister is her uncorroborated word.
"World leaders." Likewise, when asked about "world leaders" to whom she was
trafficked, Plaintiff referred vaguely to someone she was introduced to as a "prince."
Q: Other world leaders, what other world leaders were you sexually trafficked to?
[Objection interposed and overruled by Special Master]
A: Okay. Prince Andrew for one.
Q: Other than Prince Andrew?
36 Plaintiff and her counsel later devised a plan to just outright change these three answers
through the errata sheet, claiming that Plaintiff had "misunderstood the question" and she had in
fact been trafficked to such a president. ExHIBIT JJ. As her clear answers and frustration at the
repeated nature of the questioning demonstrates, however, she had no trouble whatsoever
understanding the question at the time.

A: There is another individual that I honestly do not know his name.
Q: What country is he from?
A: I'm not too sure, he spoke in a foreign he did speak foreign tongue, he spoke
English as well, but I'm not too sure where he was from?
Q: How do you know he is a world leader?
A: I was introduced to him as a prince.
Q: Did you - where were you when you met him?
A: On this occasion the South of France.
•••
Q: Where in the South of France were you?
A: I don't know.
Q: Were you on a boat, were you in a house?
A: We were at a like a cabana, not cabana, like a resort, but it was a big party.
Q: Who was throwing the party?
A: I don't know. I was just brought there.
ExIBIT II at 15-17. Indeed, this is almost the identical answer that Plaintiff later gave when
questioned about what which "powerful businessmen" she had been sent to have sex with:
Q: Where were you sent to have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain by
Ghislaine Maxwell?
A: I believe that was one time in France.
Q: I believe it was around the same time that Naomi Campbell had a birthday
party.
A: Where did you have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain in France around
the time of Naomi Campbell's birthday party?
A: In his own cabana townhouse thing. It was part of a hotel, but I wouldn't call it

EXHIBIT N at 203. In fact, Naomi Campbell's birthday is May 22, 1970. [WIKIPEDIA]. The
flight logs do not show plaintiff traveling to France in May 2001 or May 2002. EXHIBIT BB at
DR_0046, DR_0056. On May 22, 2002, for example, Epstein was in Russia.
In her joinder motion, Plaintiff made the additional claim that Epstein (not Maxwell)
sexually trafficked her to "model scout" Jean Luc Brunel on numerous occasions and in
numerous places, including "the South of France." EXHIBIT D at 5-6. The flight logs, however,
demonstrate that Plaintiff was never in the "south of France," much less on multiple occasions.
The one and only trip reflecting travel by Plaintiff to France was a trip on March 6, 2001 from a
fueling stop in Canada to Paris, followed by a departure from Paris on March 8, 2001 to
Granada. EXHIBIT BB at DR_
_ 000043; EXHIBIT CC at 107. Although there are other flights in
which Epstein went to Nice in the south of France, Plaintiff is not on any of them and none are
near Naomi Campbell's birthday on May 22.
Plaintiff's claim in her joinder motion about having been trafficked to other "prominent
American politicians" and other world leaders have gone unsubstantiated and are patently
incredible. Because these men are publicized to have been in the company of Epstein on at least
one occasion, such was apparently sufficient for Plaintiff to claim she had been trafficked to
them. For example, Plaintiff claimed at her deposition that these powerful men to whom she was
trafficked included Marvin Minsky. EXHIBIT N at 204. Dr. Minsky, a world-renowned scholar
and long-time professor at MIT, passed away in January 2016 at the age of 88. 3 At the time of
his passing, he had been married to his wife, pediatrician Dr. Gloria Rudisch, since 1952 and had
three children and four grandchildren. His name appears on one of Epstein's flight logs as having
traveled with a large group of individuals, including plaintiff, from New Jersey to Santa Fe on

March 29 and returning on March 31, 2001.38 The other passengers included world-renowned
philanthropist Dr. Henry Jarecki, now aged 83, also a long-time husband, famed academic and
scholar, and famous philanthropist.39
Plaintiff produced no evidence substantiating any of her fantastical claims that she had
been trafficked by Epstein, or by Maxwell, to any of these men or any others. No witnesses
vouched for seeing plaintiff in the company of politicians George Mitchell or Bill Richardson to
whom plaintiff claims she was sent. She produced no photographs of herself with them. She had
a journal where she claims she documented their names, but she claims she burned that journal in
2013. In May 2011, plaintiff inquired by email to journalist Sharon Churcher to "remind" her of
the famous people to whom she was trafficked. Plaintiff has not supported her claims with clear
and convincing evidence and thus, Ms. Maxwell's denials and characterizations of these claims
as "obvious lies" is not defamatory as a matter of law.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of
Ms. Maxwell.
38 Plaintiff claims, however, that she was trafficked to Dr. Minsky in the U.S. Virgin
Islands.

Prince Andrew and the 17-year-old girl his
sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet

• Virginia Roberts reveals she is 'Jane Doe 102' in Jeffrey Epstein case
• Mother-of-three spent four years as millionaire's personal masseuse
• She describes being flown across world to meet Prince Andrew
• Epstein trained her 'as a prostitute for him and his friends'
As the UK's special representative for international trade, the Duke of York holds an important
position, requiring sound judgement and widespread respect.
ut those qualities have been thrown into question since photographs of Prince Andrew with r
ilionaire financier friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child-sex offender who was jailed for '
months for soliciting underage prostitutes, appeared last weekend.
Today, however, even more serious doubts are cast on his suitability after a woman at the centre of
the Epstein case revealed to The Mail on Sunday that she had, as a 17-year-old employed by
Epstein, been flown across the world to be introduced to the Prince.

eyewitness, photographs and flight details of Epstein's private jets.

Manhattan.
The photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with
58-year-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in
December, when he was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.
It is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein's guest.
A lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was
a guest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models.
Some guests were horrified,' said the article's author, Vicky Ward.
It should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his
sentence for offences relating to child prostitution.
However, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one
reading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can
be in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges.
Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his
friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year
old girl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an 'erotic massage'.
The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him.
Eventually, Epstein struck a 'plea bargain' with prosecutors - a practice not permitted under British
law - under which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.
Police claim that his donations to politicians and his 'dream team' of influential lawyers deterred
prosecutors from bringing more serious charges of sex-trafficking. The deal certainly kept the names
of a lot of Epstein's famous friends out of an embarrassing court case.
However, an unusual part of the agreement was that Epstein's alleged victims were allowed to bring
civil proceedings against him.
He has so far made 17 out-of-court settlements, and some cases are ongoing. One of these girls
was to have been a key witness for the prosecution had the case gone to trial. She was just 15
years old when she was drawn into Epstein's exploitative world in 1998.
in her civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102' she alleged that her duties
included being 'sexually exploited by Epstein's adult male peers including royalty.
Now, horrified by the evidence of Epstein and Andrew enjoying each other's company in New York,
Jane Doe 102 has agreed to waive her anonymity and tell for the first time her deeply disturbing
Her real name is Virginia Roberts and she now lives in Australia, where she is a happily married
mother of three.
Over the course of a week during which she spoke at length to The Mail on Sunday, she appeared
sometimes vulnerable, and sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute and consistent.
Revisiting events from a past that she had hoped she had left behind, Virginia occasionally buried
her face in her hands.
Some recollections - and, for reasons of taste, not all the details can be included here - caused her
to flush with shame. 'I'm telling you things that even my husband didn't know, she said.
Virginia, who has undergone counselling to try to come to terms with her past, is honest about her
initiation into Epstein's depraved world.
She was a troubled teenager, whose slender figure, delicate complexion, hesitant voice and soulful
blue eyes made her look young for her years.
Born in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch on
the West Coast of America.
This seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a man close to her
family.
The fallout from that led to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blaming herself, Virginia began to
get into trouble Aged 11, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.
Living on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. I
was a paedophile's dream,' she says.
Three years later, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had
moved to Palm Beach,
Florida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump's country club, Mar-a-Lago.
Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her 15th
birthday, she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse
"I was wearing my uniform - a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was
approached by Ghislaine, ' Virginia says.
"I told her I wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman
who was looking for a travelling masseuse.
To get training and be paid well. Virginia's father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being
handed the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer.
He drove her to Epstein's pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront - he also owns a nine-storey
home in New York, the city's biggest private residence; a 7,500-acre ranch called 'Zorro' in New

A new life: Virgina, now a mother-of-three, in
Australia
Virginia says: 'Ghislaine said I was to start immediately and that someone would drive me home.
My father left and I was told to go upstairs!' She was led by another woman through Epstein's
bedroom into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table.
He started to interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions.
Presumably, she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.
Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.
Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had
shown her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.
Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. 'My face was red with
embarrassment, she says. 'But I felt under immense pressure to please them.
The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his
private jet and have a well-paid profession. Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to
return the next day.
That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.
For three of those years, she was under Florida's age of consent, which is 18.

Troubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorro ranch in New Mexico in 2001
Virginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a
teacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political,
financial and academic establishment.
As a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.
He guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an 'erotic massage.'
Virginia said: 'I would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad
he carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me.
'And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash,
Virginia felt even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more
disturbing role.
and is triends trainihared his prorest in form Epstein had trained me
and his friends who shared his interest in young
girls she says: 'After about two years, he started to do whatever men
to ask me to "entertain" his friends.'
It started when Epstein called Virginia at the Palm Wanted. I told myself I
Beach apartment he had rented for her.
She recalls: 'He said, "'ve got a good friend and | was special
need you to fly to the island to
entertain him, massage him and make him feel how you make me feel."
He didn't spell out what I had to do. He didn't have to. 'He'd trained me to do whatever a man
wanted. I was shocked but I told myself he was sharing me around because he trusted me and I was
special.
I was worried, but i would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep my place as his number
one girl.
He would keep telling me how lucky I was with the life I was leading and the money I was making. It
was easy to fall into his grasp.
'The way it usually worked was l'd be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the
Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.' She was 'given' to men ranging
in age from their 40s to their 60s.
They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a
world-renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state.
None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in
Epstein's circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them
"They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,' she
says. 'But I was one of the very few he trusted as "special" and chosen to "entertain" his friends.'
Virginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. 'It was an escape drug,' she
says. 'It made me calm and helped me forget about what I had to do. I was up to eight pills a day.'
Epstein had no objection to Virginia's use of prescription drugs, no doubt recognising that they made
her even more malleable. 'I didn't want to go back to the life I'd had before' she says.
That made me totally obedient.' Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this life now
seemed normal to Virginia. 'I felt that he and Ghislaine really cared for me,' she said
'We'd do family things, like watch Sex And The City and eat popcorn. 'A lot of it was very glamorous.
I met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell. He introduced me
as his "travelling masseuse."
Some people mistook me for his daughter. 'When we were in New York or Palm Beach, Ghislaine

Jeffrey bought me jewellery - diamonds were
his favourite - and wonderful furniture. He was
paying me very well because I'd give him sex
whenever he wanted it"
She was, she says, delighted when Epstein
invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip
in 2001.
'He said we'd be going to Europe and North
Africa to meet architects and interior decorators
because he wanted to redo his New Mexico
house.
I threw my arms around him and gave him a
peck on the cheek.! They flew to Paris, then
Spain, then Tangier.
Finally, they went to London. 'After we landed,
we drove straight to Ghislaine's house,' says
Virginia. 'I was given a small upstairs bedroom.
The following morning, Ghislaine came in.
She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying,
"Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day.
We've got to go shopping. You need a dress as
you're going to dance with a Prince tonight."
'She said I needed to be "smiley" and bubbly

We got back to Ghislaine's house at around 4pm and I ran straight upstairs to shower and dress.
When I went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door.
Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. 'Ghislaine served tea from a
porcelain pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's
daughters.
Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17 and they all laughed.
Ghislaine made a joke that I was getting too old for Jeffrey.
She said, "He'll soon have to trade her in." It was widely known that he liked young girls.! The four of
them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her.
'After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine's.
All of us went upstairs and I asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. I wanted
something to show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left.
'In the morning, Ghislaine said, "You did well. He had fun". We flew straight back to the States.' The
Mail on Sunday has confirmed that the tycoon's jet flew to Paris on March 6, 2001, continuing to
Granada, Tangier and London, before returning to New York.
On the last leg of the trip, Virginia was paid about $15,000 (£9,400) by Epstein. 'It was amazing
money, more than I'd ever made on a trip with him before.
He didn't say there was any special reason, but I felt like I'd done everything he wanted. He was very
pleased.'

Virginia says she met Andrew for a second time around Easter 2001 at Epstein's Manhattan
mansion.
When I got to the mansion, I was told, "Get ready. You are meeting someone in the office" - which
is what they called the library. Andrew was sitting there in a big leather armchair.

Organiser: Ghislaine Maxwell looks on as Andrew put his arm around Virginia. Robert Maxwell's daughter
invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse soon after her 15th birthday
We kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.' Johanna spoke to The Mail on
Sunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.
She said: 'Ghislaine put the puppet's hand on Virginia's breast, then Andrew put his hand on my
breast. It was a great joke. Everybody laughed.' After this, Virginia was paid, by Epstein, around
$400 (£250):
She met Andrew for the third and final time on Epstein's Caribbean island, Little Saint James.
Virginia was never under the British legal age of consent when she met Andrew. She was 17 during
the first two encounters and 18 at the third.
By now, however, Epstein, had started to hint that she was getting too old' for him.
But during one trip to the island, Epstein and Ghislaine made their most astonishing proposition, and
one which repulsed her. They said Jeffrey wanted me to have his child,' she says.
They said I was part of their family and I was beautiful, young, loyal and nurturing and would be a
great mother.
They said I would have to sign a contract relinquishing rights to the child and consenting to Jeffrey
having as many relationships as he liked. In return I would have my own mansion in Palm Beach
and a large monthly payment, a percentage of his income!
This, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and she began to see the way in which she had been
groomed.
'It was a smack in the face,' she says. 'I finally realised this wasn't ever going to be a real
relationship but I knew if I refused, I'd be thrown back on the streets. So I said, 'I'm too young. I
want to get my massage credentials, then maybe we'll do it":
The tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand
where he enrolled her in a massage course.
Shortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love
and, just ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony.
'I called Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,' Virginia says. 'I was hoping he'd be delighted.
But he said, "Have a nice life," and hung up on me! The couple now have two sons, aged five and
four, and a daughter who recently turned one.
The first few months after I married Robert were the worst,' she says. 'I couldn't bring myself to tell
him much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out.
'I felt very alone. I was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants.
' Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned
by the FBI.

Conviction: Jeffrey Epstein
'He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question,
it could be incriminating, a source told The Mail on Sunday.
Epstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a 'slap on the wrist' for him,
and ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme
Lawyer Brad Edwards, who represented several of Epstein's victims, said: 'Rather than punish him
the way they would an average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power
and influence, the system can be bought.
Virginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings
bottled up until last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.
Virginia says: 'I am appalled. To me, it's saying, "We are above the law." But Jeffrey is a monster.'
Last night, neither Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell nor Prince Andrew would comment on Virginia's story.

Epstein reveals how she twice met Bill

As a New Yorker from humble beginnings, Jeffrey Epstein played on his blue-collar credentials and
enormous wealth to extend tentacles of influence throughout America's liberal political elite.
During the outcry over the Epstein case, it emerged that another man with a notorious appetite for
young women, Bill Clinton, travelled with Epstein to a number of destinations, including three times
on the billionaire's private aircraft.
on one occasion, Epstein few the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch Democrat Kevir
spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton's, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to 'discuss AIDS policy'
Claims: Virginia Roberts says she twice met ex-president Bill Clinton, pictured last month, but was never 'tent
out"
Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic
Party, also flew with Mr Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong
Kong, Shanghai and Beijing.
Yet Virginia Roberts stresses that she was never 'lent out' to Mr Clinton.
On one occasion, she adds, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his
Caribbean island for Mr Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President
did not take the bait.
'I'd have been about 17 at the time,' she says. 'I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then
Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bouaht her.

'She'd always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take lessons, and 1 remember she was very
excited because she got her licence around the first year we met.
'I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember him
talking about what a good job she did.
'I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that they were good friends.
'I asked, "How come?" and he laughed and said, "He owes me some favours." Maybe he was just
joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as Bill and [Prince] Andrew
weren't more careful.
Bill must have known about Jeffrey's girls. There were three desks in the living area of the villa on
the island.
Speaking out: Virginia, now aged 26, in her new home in Australia
They were covered with pictures of Jeffrey shaking hands with famous people and photos of naked
girls, including one of me that Jeffrey had at all his houses, lying in a hammock.
We all dined together that night. Jeffrey was at the head of the table. Bill was at his left. I sat across
from him. Emmy Tayler, Ghislaine's blonde British assistant, sat at my right.
Ghislaine was at Bill's left and at the left of Ghislaine there were two olive-skinned brunettes who'd
flown in with us from New York.
"I'd never met them before. I'd say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking.
They weren't there for me. They weren't there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have
sex with Jeffrey on the trip.
Maybe Jefirey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in
them. He and Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny.

According to prison records, when Epstein was
serving his jail term, his visitors included a long-
time - and highly controversial - Clinton acquaintance, Arnold Prosperi.
"In the final hours of the Clinton presidency, in January 2001, Prosperi was facing three years in
prison after being convicted of tax fraud. Mr Clinton commuted his sentence to house arrest.
'Clinton, Prosperi and Epstein make an odd threesome on the face of it, says a law enforcement
source.
Was Prosperi visiting Epstein as some kind of intermediary for Bill?
'Maybe Bill wanted to know if Epstein knew anything that could embarrass him. Or did Bill commute
Prosperi's sentence as some kind of favour
for Epstein?'
Virginia disclosed that Mr Clinton's vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also guests of
Epstein on his island.

Guests: Virginia says she also met former Vice President Al Gore, pictured right with Mr Clinton
Last summer, the Gores abruptly announced that they were ending their supposedly fairytale
marriage and, just weeks later, it emerged that Mr Gore - the famously sanctimonious global-
warming disciple - had been accused of trying to force sex on a woman with whom he had booked a
therapeutic massage at an Oregon hotel.
'I had no clue that anything was up, Virginia says. 'The Gores seemed like a beautiful couple when I
met them. All I knew was that Mr Gore was a friend of Jeffrey's and Ghislaine's. Jeffrey didn't ask me
to give him a massage.
There might have been a couple of other girls there on that trip but I could never have imagined this
guy would do anything wrong. I was planning to vote for him when I turned 18. I thought he was
awesome.'
Virginia said that yet another American liberal icon, President Obama's Middle East peace envoy
Senator George Mitchell, frequently visited Epstein's New York residence.
Mr Mitchell, aged 77 - who previously led America's Northern Ireland peace initiative - 'was very
close to Jeffrey, Virginia recalled. 'He is very clean-cut. You wouldn't think of him being part of
Jeffrey's crew.'

But he also took his defence very seriously indeed. Epstein engaged his friend, the Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz - whose celebrity clients have included Mike Tyson, Patty Hearst, Claus
von Bulow and O.J. Simpson - to run his legal defence
He also employed a firm of private investigators to investigate the backgrounds of the girls.
Detectives painstakingly built a case which they believed showed that Epstein systematically paid
teenage girls to recruit other teenage girls to his sex ring.
However, as the investigation continued, they found that Epstein's team had already spoken to key
witnesses, suggesting that the financier would reward those who helped him.
In addition, Epstein's defence team agreed to the unusual move of suggesting that the alleged
victims sue Epstein in the civil courts. The result was a plea bargain in which Epstein admitted a
single charge of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution - a deal which infuriated many police
officers who worked on the case.
More than 20 of Epstein's girls are said to have sued him for damages. At least 17 have settled out

Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine
Maxwell
BY DEVONSTURES SOLICITORS, PRNE
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 0, 2011
LONDON, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the
various allegations about her
that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations
are all entirely
false.
It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal
representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth
and asking for
the allegations to be withdrawn have simply been ignored.
In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take
legal action against those newspapers.
"I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is
well known that certain newspapers live by the adage, "why
let the truth get
in the way of a good storv" However, the allegations made
against me are
abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask that they stop," said
Ghislaine
Maxwell.
"A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of
ассигасу
in their reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the
most
elementary investigation or any real due diligence. I am now
taking action to
clear my name," she said.

JANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2
UNITED STATES
JANE DOE #3 AND JANE DOE #4's CORRECTED MOTION PURSUANT TO RULE 21
FOR JOINDER IN ACTION
COME NOW Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 (also referred to as "the new victims"), by and
through undersigned counsel, to file this motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21
to join this action, on the condition that they not re-litigate any issues already litigated by Jane
Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 (also referred to as "the current victims"). The new victims have
suffered the same violations of their rights under the Crime Victims" Rights Act (CVRA) as the
current victims. Accordingly, they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.
Because the new victims will not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by the current victims
(and because they are represented by the same legal counsel as the current victims), the
Government will not be prejudiced if the Court grants the motion. The Court may "at any time"
add new parties to the action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Accordingly, the Court should grant the
motion.'
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
'As minor victims of sexual offenses, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 desire to proceed by
way of pseudonym for the same reasons that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 proceeded in this
fashion. Counsel for the new victims have made their true identities known to the Government.

Case 9:08-CV-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 2 of 14
As the Court is aware, more than six years ago, Jane Doe #1 filed the present action
against the Government, alleging a violation of her rights under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771.
DE1. She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had
entered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her
rights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court allowed Jane Doe #2 to also join the
action. Both Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to
protect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with
fairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #1
and Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.
The Court has firmly rejected the United States' position. In a detailed ruling, the Court
concluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 even though federal
charges were never filed. DE 189. The Court explained that because the NPA barred
prosecution of crimes committed against them by Epstein, they had "standing" to assert
violations of the CVRA rights. Id. The Court deferred ruling on whether the two victims would
be entitled to relief, pending development of a fuller evidentiary record. Id.
Two other victims, who are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims,
now wish to join this action. The new victims joining at this stage will not cause any delay and
their joinder in this case is the most expeditious manner in which to pursue their rights. Because
the background regarding their abuse is relevant to the Court's assessment of whether to allow
them to join, their circumstances are recounted here briefly.

As with Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, Jane Doe #3 was repeatedly sexually abused by
Epstein. The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from Jane
Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA. If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe #3
would prove the following:
In 1999, Jane Doe #3 was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main women
whom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator
in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. In fact, it became known to the government that
Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane
Doe #3. Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein's
mansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators
coerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2). When Jane Doe #3
began giving Epstein a "massage," Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as
they had done with many other victims. Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and
with the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a "sex slave."
Epstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about 1999 through 2002, when she managed to
escape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From
1999 through 2002, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm
Beach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in international airspace on
his Epstein's private planes, and elsewhere.
Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to
politically-connected and financially-powerful people. Epstein's purposes in "lending" Jane Doe
(along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for

business, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail
information.
One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual
relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's
and well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual
relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but
also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to
being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshowitz was an eye-witness
to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's co-conspirators.
Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein's behalf.
Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal
prosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to any potential co-
conspirators of Epstein." NPA at 5. Thus, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for
sexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if
disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's defense team) and the
Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein's victims and the
general public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act.
Ghislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein's inner circle and a co-conspirator in
Epstein's sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity
granted by the NPA for the crimes she committed in Florida. In addition to participating in the
sexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures

of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3. She shared these
photographs (which constituted child pornography under applicable federal laws) with Epstein.
The Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these
photographs.
Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had
direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For
instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with
was a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3
was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate
geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New York, and on
Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged
girls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and
required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell
facilitated Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a "madame" for Epstein, thereby
assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual
purposes.
Another person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost
no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc
Brunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein's closest friends and a regular traveling
companion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a
model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S.
passports for young girls to "work" as models. He would bring young girls (ranging to ages as

young as twelve to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends,
especially Epstein. Brunel would offer the girls "modeling" jobs. Many of the girls came from
poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making
good money. Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to observe him, Brunel and Maxwell engage in illegal
sexual acts with dozens of underage girls. Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with
Brunel on numerous occasions, at places including Epstein's mansion in West Palm Beach, Little
St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other
underage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south of France, and California.
Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men,
including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign
presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3
to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.
The Government was well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it
listed her as a victim in the attachment to the NPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary investigation
of Jane Doe #3's relationship to Epstein would have revealed the fact that she had been
trafficked throughout the United States and internationally for sexual purposes. Nonetheless, the
Government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any
Federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As
with Jane Doe #1, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement
from Jane Doe #3 - all in violation of her rights under the CVRA - to avoid Jane Doe #3 from
raising powerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein

and other powerful individuals and that would likely have been prevented it from being
concluded in the secretive manner in which it was.
Jane Doe #4's Circumstances
If permitted to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could prove at trial, that
she has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, based on the
following:
As with the other Jane Does, Jane Doe #4 was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein. In
or around the summer of 2002, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-
old child, was told by another one of Epstein's underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could
make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe
#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4
to go to Epstein's house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the
phone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to
his mansion in Palm Beach.
Jane Doe #4 then went to Epstein's mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein's large
bathroom by one of Epstein's assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and lay face
down on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her
age and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed illegal
sexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.
Epstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these
sexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.e., on his personal
jet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doe #4.

Case 9:08-cV-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 8 of 14
The acts Epstein committed against Jane Doe #4, constituted numerous federal sex
offenses, some of which do not carry a statute of limitations and thus are not time-barred. See 18
U.S.C. § 3283. And these offenses were the kinds of offenses that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida were pursuing
in 2007. So far as Jane Doe #4 is aware, the U.S. Attorney's Office made no serious effort to
locate her. Instead, after identifying approximately forty separate underage sexually abused
victims, and apparently preparing a 53-page federal indictment and with full awareness of the
existence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 - unidentified and not interviewed - it entered into a
non-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein's federal crimes against these victims.
This is contrary to the Government's normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It
also violated Jane Doe #4's rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a
"reasonable" right to confer with the U.S. Attorney's Office before they entered into an
agreement with a sex offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he committed against
her. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5).
MOTION FOR JOINDER
Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 now both move to join this action filed by Jane Doe #1 and
Jane Doe #2, pursuant to Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 21 provides that
"Io]n motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add... a party." Rule 21
"grants the court broad discretion to permit a change in the parties at any stage of a litigation."
Ford v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l, 268 F. Supp. 2d 271, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (internal quotation
omitted). The new victims should be allowed to join the current victims in this action under Rule
21.

The new victims will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in
the same way as it violated the rights of the other victims. The new victims' participation in this
case is important because it appears that the Government intends to raise a factual defense that
somehow it did keep Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 properly informed of what was happening in
the criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not
properly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for
a CVRA violation.
In addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation is relevant to a defense the
Court has allowed the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims'
request for rescission of the NPA "implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be
considered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant
prosecutorial
authorities and the federal offense victims- including an assessment of the
allegation of a deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims
in the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well
after the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli" DE
189 at 12 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3's and Jane Doe #4's participation in this case will
help to show what the "entire interface" was between the Government and the victims and thus
to respond to the Government's estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be
preparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the Government to the victim's
summary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments against the
victim's position).

Jane Doe #3's and Jane Doe #4's participation is also directly relevant to the discovery
disputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections
to the documents that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 are attempting to obtain. The current
victims have responded by explaining how these documents are relevant, including explaining
how these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his powerful political and
social connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government's
motive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims' claims in an effort to
maintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims' knowledge. See, e.g.,
DE 266 at 6-10. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation will help prove the relevancy of
these requests, as well as the need for those requests.
One clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding
Epstein's lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea
arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince
Andrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2
have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the
non-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and
political connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See,
e.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at 16-18). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knowledge of
Epstein's connection with some of these powerful people and thus how Epstein might have used
them to secure favorable treatment.
Adding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings. They will
simply join in motions that the current victims were going to file in any event. For example, the

new victims will simply join in a single summary judgment motion that the current victims
anticipate filing after discovery has been completed.
Nor will adding the new victims prejudice the United States. As the court is aware, this
Court is still in its initial discovery stage. The Court is currently considering whether to reject
the Government's assertion of privilege over documents regarding the case. See DE 265
(victims' reassertion of objections to the Government privilege claims). The new victims do not
seek any additional discovery beyond that previously sought by the current victims.?
Accordingly, the United States will not be prejudiced or burdened by adding them to this case.
The CVRA does not contain any statute of limitations for filing an action to enforce
rights under the statute. Accordingly, were the Court to deny this motion, the result might be
that the new victims would then be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims, which would
then possibly proceed on a separate litigation track. Rather than require duplicative litigation,
the Court should simply grant their motion to join.
Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 support the joinder motion. Counsel for the victims have
discussed this motion with the Government at length in an effort to avoid any need to file a
substantive pleading on the issue. Counsel for the victims asked the Government during the
summer for its position on joinder.
The Government, however, took the matter under
advisement for months.
Ultimately, after
several inquiries from victims counsel, the
Government indicated without explanation that it opposes this motion. Counsel for the victims
has requested a meeting with the Government on this issue, which will hopefully occur in
2 Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have asked the Government to provide them with the
record of their statements that they provided to the FBI. These FBI 302's should be only a few
pages long.

January. In the meantime, however, counsel for the victims believe that it is no longer
appropriate to delay filing this motion and accordingly file it at this time. Because the
Government is apparently opposing this motion, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have described
the circumstances surrounding their claims so that the Court has appropriate information to rule
on the motion.

CONCLUSION
Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 should be allowed to join this action, pursuant to Rule 21
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Their joinder should be conditioned on the requirement
that they not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. A
proposed order to that effect is attached to this pleading.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
CASE NO.:08-CV-80736-KAM
JANE DOE 1 and JANE DOE 2,
Petitioners,
VS.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Respondent.
ORDER DENYING PETITIONERS' MOTION TO JOIN UNDER RULE 21 AND
MOTION TO AMEND UNDER RULE 15
This cause is before the Court on Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4's Corrected Motion
Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action ("Rule 21 Motion") (DE 280), and Jane Doe 1 and Jane
Doe 2's Protective Motion Pursuant to Rule 15 to Amend Their Pleadings to Conform to
Existing Evidence and to Add Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 as Petitioners ("Rule 15 Motion") (DE
311). Both motions are ripe for review. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that they
should be denied
I. Background
This is an action by two unnamed petitioners, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, seeking to
prosecute a claim under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771. (DE 1).
Generally, they allege that the respondent Government violated their rights under the CVRA by
failing to consult with them before negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein,
who subjected them to various sexual crimes while they were minors. (Id.). Petitioners initiated
this action in July 2008. (Id.).


Case 9:08-c&80736-RAMB, Document 328, 0312reAl 26392300R@90 3409120185 Page 2 of 10
On December 30, 2014, two other unnamed victims, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4, moved
to join as petitioners in this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. (DE 280).
Petitioners (Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2) support the Rule 21 Motion. (Id. at 11). Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 argue that they "have suffered the same violations of their rights under the [CVRA]
as the Petitioners, and they "desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well." (Id. at
1). The Government vehemently opposes joinder under Rule 21. (DE 290). The Government
argues that Rule 15 is the proper procedural device for adding parties to an action, not Rule 21.
(Id. at 1).
"[O]ut of an abundance of caution," Petitioners filed a motion to amend their petition
under Rule 15, conforming the petition to the evidence and adding Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 as
petitioners. (DE 311 at 2). The Government opposes the Rule 15 Motion as well. (DE 314).
Among other things, the Government argues that amending the petition to include Jane Doe 3
and Jane Doe 4 should be denied because of their undue delay in seeking to join the proceedings,
and the undue prejudice that amendment will cause. (Id.).
After considering the parties' submissions and the proposed amended petition, the Court
finds that justice does not require amendment in this instance and exercises its discretion to deny
the amendment.
II. Discussion
"The decision whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is within the sole discretion of
the district court." Laurie v. Ala. Ct. Crim. Apps., 256 F.3d 1266, 1274 (11th Cir. 2001). "The
court should freely give leave when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Justice does
not require amendment in several instances,
"includ[ing] undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive
2


Case 9:08-c&88736-RAMP, Document 329, 08Mera n F£302300k₴9035091295 Page 3 of 10
on the part of the movant, ... undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the
amendment, [and] futility of amendment." Laurie, 256 F.3d at 1274 (quoting Foman v. Davis,
371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). In addition to considering the effect of amendment on the parties, the
court must consider "the importance of the amendment on the proper determination of the merits
of a dispute." 6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 1488, p. 814 (3d ed. 2010). Justice does
not require amendment where the addition of parties with duplicative claims will not materially
advance the resolution of the litigation on the merits. See Herring v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 894
F.2d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 1989).
Rule 21 Motion
Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4's first attempt to join in this proceeding was brought under
Rule 21. (DE 280). "If parties seck to add a party under Rule 21, courts generally use the
standard of Rule 15, governing amendments to pleadings, to determine whether to allow the
addition." 12 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P., p. 432 (3d ed. 2013); see also Galustian v.
Peter, 591 F.3d 724, 729-30 (4th Cir. 2010) (collecting cases and noting that Rule 15(a) applies
to amendments seeking to add parties); Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1365 (10th Cir.
1993) ("A motion to add a party is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) ....").
Rule 21, "Misjoinder and Non-joinder of Parties," provides the court with a tool for
correcting the "misjoinder" of parties that would otherwise result in dismissal. Fed. R. Civ. P.
21. Insofar as Rule 21 "relates to the addition of parties, it is intended to permit the bringing in
of a person, who through inadvertence, mistake or for some other reason, had not been made a
party and whose presence as a party is later found necessary or desirable." United States v. Com.
Bank of N. Am., 31 F.R.D. 133, 135 (S.D.N. Y. 1962) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Case 9:08-c788736-RAPP, Document 32a, 03M2realn F6302300ke903609120495 Page 4 of 10
In their Rule 21 Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omitted
from this proceeding due to any "inadvertence" or "mistake" by Petitioners; rather, they seek to
join this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition
under Rule 20 ("Permissive Joinder of Parties"). As courts generally use the standards of Rule
15 to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the
Rule 15 Motion.' The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 21 Motion as if
they are set forth in the Rule 15 Motion as well. Because the arguments are presented in the Rule
15 Motion (and because the Court is denying the Rule 15 Motion on its merits, as discussed
below), the Rule 21 Motion will be denied.
The Court also concludes that portions of the Rule 21 Motion and related
filings should be stricken from the record. Pending for this Court's consideration is a Motion
for Limited Intervention filed by Alan M. Dershowitz, who seeks to intervene to "strike the
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and [to] request] a show cause order to
the attorneys that have made them." (DE 282 at 1). The Court has considered Mr. Dershowitz's
arguments, but it finds that his intervention is unnecessary as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(f) empowers the Court "on its own" to "strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).
Petitioners' Rule 21 Motion consists of relatively little argumentation regarding why the
Court should permit them to join in this action: they argue that (1) they were sexually abused by
1 The Court notes that, regardless of which motion it considers, the same standard
governs the addition of parties under Rule 21 and Rule 15. See Goston v. Potter, No. 08-cv-478
FJS ATB, 2010 WL 4774238, at *5 (N.D.N. Y. 2010) (citing Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Universal
Music Grp., Inc., 248 F.R.D. 408, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)).
4


Case 9:08-c788736-RAPP, Document 32a, 03M2realn F6302300ke90370912095 Page 5 of 10
Jeffrey Epstein, and (2) the Government violated their CVRA rights by concealing the non-
prosecution agreement with them. (DE 280 at 3; see id. at 7-8). However, the bulk of the Rule
21 Motion consists of copious factual details that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 "would prove" "lilf
allowed to join this action." (Id. at 3, 7). Specifically, Jane Doe 3 proffers that she could prove
the circumstances under which a non-party introduced her to Mr. Epstein, and how Mr. Epstein
sexually trafficked her to several high-profile non-party individuals, "including numerous
prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known
Prime Minister, and other world leaders." (Id. at 3-6). She names several individuals, and she
offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took place. (See id. at 5)?
At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the
determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted to join Petitioners'
claim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding
with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent
to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed
them CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not
related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.
The original Rule 21 Motion (DE 279) shall be stricken in its entirety, as it is wholly
superseded by the "corrected" version of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 280). From the corrected Rule
21 Motion, the Court shall strike all factual details regarding Jane Doe 3 between the following
sentences: "The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from
" Jane Doe 4's proffer is limited to sexual acts between Mr. Epstein and herself. (See DE
280 at 7-8).
5


Case 9:08-c788736-RAPP, Document 32a, 03M2realn F6302300ke903009120495 Page 6 of 10
Jane Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA" (id. at 3); and "The Government was
well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the
attachment to the NPA" (id. at 6). As none of Jane Doe 4's factual details relate to non-parties,
the Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 21 Motion related to her
circumstances. Regarding the Declaration in support of Petitioners' response to Mr.
Dershowitz's motion to intervene (DE 291-1), the Court shall strike paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 11, 13,
15, 19 through 53, and 59, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-parties. Regarding
the Declaration of Jane Doe 3 in support of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 310-1), the Court shall strike
paragraphs 7 through 12, 16, 39, and 49, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-
parties. Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof,
should Petitioners demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a
matter presented for the Court's consideration.
As mentioned, Mr. Dershowitz moves to intervene "for the limited purposes of moving to
strike the outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause
order to the attorneys that have made them." (DE 282 at 1). As the Court has taken it upon itself
to strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 21 Motion and related filings, the Court
concludes that Mr. Derschowitz's intervention in this case is unnecessary. Accordingly, his
motion to intervene will be denied as moot.? Regarding whether a show cause order should
3 This also moots Mr. Dershowitz's Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in
Support of Motion for Limited Intervention. (DE 317). Denying Mr. Dershowitz's motion to
intervene also renders moot Petitioners' motion (DE 292) to file a sealed document supporting its
response to Mr. Dershowitz's motion. It will accordingly be denied as moot, and DE 293 (the
sealed response) will be stricken from the record.

issue, the Court finds that its action of striking the lurid details from Petitioners' submissions is
sanction enough. However, the Court cautions that all counsel are subject to Rule 11's mandate
that all submissions be presented for a proper purpose and factual contentions have evidentiary
support, Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1) and (3), and that the Court may, on its own, strike from any
pleading "any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter," Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).
B.
Rule 15 Motion
Between their two motions (the Rule 21 Motion and Rule 15 Motion), Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 assert that "they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights [under the
CVRA] as well." (DE 280 at 1). Although Petitioners already seek the invalidation of Mr.
Epstein's non-prosecution agreement on behalf of all "other similarly-situated victims" (DE 189
at 1; DE 311 at 2, 12, 15, 18-19), Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 argue that they should be fellow
travelers in this pursuit, lest they "be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims" resulting
in "duplicative litigation" (DE 280 at 11). The Court finds that justice does not require adding
new parties this late in the proceedings who will raise claims that are admittedly "duplicative" of
the claims already presented by Petitioners.
The Does' submissions demonstrate that it is entirely unnecessary for Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 to proceed as parties in this action, rather than as fact witnesses available to offer
relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative testimony. (See, e.g., DE 280 at 2 (Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 "are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims"), 9 ("The new victims
will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in the same way as it
violated the rights of the other victims."), 10 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 "will simply join in
motions that the current victims were going to file in any event."), 11 (litigating Jane Doe 3 and
7


Case 9:08-c788736-RAPP, Document 32a, 03M2realon F6302300ke90490912095 Page 8 of 10
Jane Doe 4's claims would be "duplicative"); DE 298 at 1 n.1 ("As promised ... Jane Doe No. 3
and Jane Doe No. 4 do not seek to expand the number of pleadings filed in this case. If allowed
to join this action, they would simply support the pleadings already being filed by Jane Doe No. 1
and Jane Doe No. 2."); DE 311 at 5 n.3 ("[A]ll four victims (represented by the same legal
counsel) intend to coordinate efforts and avoid duplicative pleadings."), 15 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane
Doe 4 "challenge the same secret agreement i.e., the NPA that the Government executed with
Epstein and then concealed from the victims. This is made clear by the proposed amendment
itself, in which all four victims simply allege the same general facts.")). As the Does argue at
length in their Rule 15 Motion, Jane Doe I's original petition "specifically allege[s] that the
Government was violating not only her rights but the rights of other similarly-situated victims."
(DE 311 at 2). The Court fails to see why the addition of "other similarly-situated victims" is
now necessary to "vindicate their rights as well." (DE 280 at 1).
Of course, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 can participate in this litigated effort to vindicate
the rights of similarly situated victims there is no requirement that the evidentiary proof
submitted in this case come only from the named parties. Petitioners point out as much, noting
that, regardless of whether this Court grants the Rule 15 Motion, "they will call Jane Doe No. 3
as a witness at any trial." (DE 311 at 17 n.7). The necessary "participation" of Jane Doe 3 and
Jane Doe 4 in this case can be satisfied by offering their properly supported and relevant,
admissible, and non-cumulative testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial
(see DE 280 at 9) or affidavits submitted to support the relevancy of discovery requests* (see
310-1).
* The non-party Jane Does clearly understand how to submit affidavits. (See DEs 291-1,


Case 9:08-c788736-RAPP, Document 32a, 03M2realn F6302300ke90410912095 Page 9 of 10
id. at 10). Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4's "participation in this
case" can only be achieved by listing them as parties.
As it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a
determination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all
"other similarly situated victims" under the CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer
relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their
participation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard. See Herring, 894 F.2d at 1024
(District court did not abuse its discretion by denying amendment where "addition of more
plaintiffs ….. would not have affected the issues underlying the grant of summary judgment."); cf.
Arthur v. Stern, 2008 WL 2620116, at *7 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (Under Rule 15, "courts have held
that leave to amend to assert a claim already at issue in [another lawsuit] should not be granted if
the same parties are involved, the same substantive claim is raised, and the same relief is
sought.")! And, as to Jane Doe 4 at least, adding her as a party raises unnecessary questions
about whether she is a proper party to this action.
Petitioners also admit that amending the petition to conform to the evidence by
including references to the non-prosecution agreement itself is "unnecessary" as the "existing
petition is broad enough to cover the developing evidence in this case." (DE 311). The Court
5 The Court expresses no opinion at this time whether any of the attestations made by
Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 in support of their motion will be relevant, admissible, and non-
cumulative.
• The Government contends that Jane Doe 4 is not a true "victim" in this case because
she was not known at the time the Government negotiated the non-prosecution agreement, and
accordingly she was not entitled to notification rights under the CVRA. (See DE 290 at 10).
Any "duplicative" litigation filed by Jane Doe 4 would necessarily raise the issue of whether she
has standing under the CVRA under these circumstances.

agrees, and it concludes that justice does not require amending the petition this late in the
proceedings.

ACUITY Reputation
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having
sexual relations with her, which he denies.
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as
they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old
defamatory claims.

worse objection, or worse grounds for me.
MR. DYER: I think questions of payment do not
fall within the scope.
BY MS. SCHULTZ:
okay. Are you currently retained by Ms.
Maxwell for professional services.
A. If I could go back to my previous answer, Ms.
Maxwell is a project client, and it's on a day rate. If
-- so, for the sake of argument between 2nd of
January 2015 and the Ist of February 2016 we were quite
busy answering these incoming calls.
so there was quite a
lot of work at that point in time.
Recently there's been
no work. There's been no need because the press activity
has died down, our function is somewhat redundant.
&. Can you estimate the last time that you worked
on this account at
Your day rate?
A.
It would have been in 2015. Probably April,
May, something like that. No invoices, no -- no payment
in 2016 from my recollection.
BY MS. SCHULTZ:
l.
Mr. Gow, I'm going to hand you another
document.

MS. SCHULTZ: Point of procedure: I have only
three copies of these documents for each of the

A.
Q.
I did.
Can you tell me what you -- what response you
made?
A.
Well, the response to Mr. Ball was part of a
series of responses having spoken to my client within 24
hours or so, we got back to Mr. Ball with an agreed
statement
which went out to a number of media.
When you say "agreed statement" can you tell me
more about what you mean? Who agreed to the statement?
A.
I need to give you some context, if I may,
about that statement.
So, this is on New Year's Day. I was

time was 22:46, and I was getting up early the next

morning to drive my family back from the south of
2
France to England, which is a 14-hour journey, door to
3
door. So on the morning of the 2nd of January,
4
bearing in mind that Ms. Maxwell, I think was in New
5
York then, she was five hours behind, so there was
6
quite a lot of, sort of time difference between the
7 various countries here, I sent her an email, I
8
believe, saying -- parsing this -- forwarding this
9
10
email to her saying "How do you wish to proceed?" And
then I was on the telephone -- I had two
telephones in
11
the car, I received in excess of
30 phone calls from
12
various media outlets on the 2nd of January, all
13
asking for information about how Ms. Maxwell was
14
looking to respond
• to the latest court filings, which
15
were filed on the 30th of December as I understand.
16
And by close -- towards close of play
17
on the 2nd,
I received an email forwarded by
18
Ms. Maxwell,
containing a draft statement which my
19
20
21
22
understanding was the majority of which had been
drafted by Mr. Barden with a header along the lines of
"This is the agreed statement." At close of play on
the 2nd.

So I -- I was -- I had gone under the
Channel Tunnel and I was sitting on the other side and
that email, which my understanding was that it had

sent out to a number of media, including Mr. Ball and
various other UK newspapers.
l.
Mr. Gow, when you say "end of play" and "close
of play, " are you referring to sending the email that's
Exhibit 2?
A. Yes, I am.

people other than those listed?

so my eldest son in the back had my BlackBerry and was
trying to capture
It was a pretty chaotic day.
Most people in
the UK were on holiday. In fact,
it was a holiday weekend, our office was closed, my PA was
on holiday, so my son was basically doing an internship in
the back of the car, downloading the names of the callers
from various media outlets and -- so we had a list of
those so when I got to the car park, at the end of the
Eurotunnel thing in the UK, I had numerous names, so the
email went out to a wide range of people.
But the 30 or so calls I had is an aggregate
number, so there might have been five calls from the BBC

from different people so they -- the BBC would only write
one story, there wouldn't be five versions of it, so 30 is
an aggregate number.
BY MS. SCHULTZ:
l. Okay. Looking again at Exhibit 2, could you
please review the individuals or email addresses of
the -- listed in the "To" and "bcc" portion?
A.
Yep.
Did you send this written statement to any
other individuals or entities who are not listed in that
portion?
A.
Within -- within 24 hours of this, yes, a wider
range of people, definitely.
This was the initial -- these are the
most pressing ones,
who
said they were going to write
a story whether they had -- if I could just explain a
bit more context again in the world of PR. When you
are in the field you're engaged and you've just --
you've got to prioritize who you spoke to and whoever
shouts the loudest usually gets responded to first.
So the reason there are two BBC people
there for instance, is there's BBC broadcast radio,
and BBC TV, and they were coming at -- from different
angles for different stories, but there was a certain
sense of urgency and immediacy. So the half a dozen

or so here were the ones that we prioritized to deal
with that night because they were publishing the next
day or -- or thereabouts, but for instance we also
spoke to the Daily Express. I can't remember the name
of the gentleman there, or the lady, but I remember
that was early the next morning when we got on to
other channels.

Q.
So you sent this statement to additional
9 individuals on January 3rd?
10
A.
Not just on January 3rd.
I mean,
as we had an
11
agreed statement there, and I do recall there is a typo
12
in this which is "Virginia" and "Victoria" -- there was a
13
14
transposition there. So the original email went out with
the typo because that
was taken from the -- the statement
15
16
that I believe Mr./
Barden was broadly the architect of,
but forwarded by Ms. Maxwell. So I just -- I took that
17
as a verbatim statement and sent it out. I re-read it in
18
19
20
21
the calm light of day the next morning. There was at
least one typo in it so I changed that and reached out,
again, to these people, updating the typo and sent it out
to additional people.

United States District Court
Southern District of New York
Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff,
Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
V.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
PLAINTIFF'S RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT'S SECOND
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION AND DEFENDANT'S INTERROGATORIES,
PLAINTIFF'S ANSWERS TO DEFENDANT'S REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26, 33, 34, Plaintiff hereby serves her
responses and objections to Defendant's Second Set of Discovery Requests and serves her
Answers to Defendant's Requests for Admission.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS
Defendant's Discovery Requests violate Rule 33, Fed. R. Civ. P., which provides "a party
may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts" -
in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in
violation of Rule 33.
Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant's Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they
seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to,
attorney client privilege, work product privilege, joint defense privilege, public interest privilege,
and any other applicable privilege.

This document is CONFIDENTIAL under the Court's Protective Order (DE 62)
on hundreds (if not thousands) of matters, and collectively have well over 100 years of combined
practice experience. Accordingly, a request that each of these attorneys list all communications
with the media is facially overbroad.
Additionally, Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause
Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of
communications that she has already produced in this case.
Moreover, Ms. Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of
documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence. Communications with the media regarding cases that bear no relation to
the subject matter of this case, from decades in the past, are facially invalid and not calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Ms. Giuffre additionally objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the
communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer,
commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter,
stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant as such
interrogatory is overly broad and unduly burdensome. Furthermore, Ms. Giuffre is not obligated
to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.
Notwithstanding such objections, Ms. Giuffre has already produced her responsive
communications, which are found in documents Bates labelled GIUFFRE000001 to
GIUFFRE007566.
Identify any "false statements" attributed to Ghislaine Maxwell which were
"published globally, including within the Southern District of New York" as You contend in
paragraph 9 of Count I of Your Complaint, including:

a. the exact false statement;
b. the date of its publication;
c. the publishing entity and title of any publication containing the purportedly false
statement;
d. the URL or internet address for any internet version of such publication; and the
nature of the publication, whether in print, internet, broadcast or some other form of
media.
Response to Interrogatory No. 6:
Ms. Giuffre objects because the information interrogatory above is in the possession of
Defendant who has failed to comply with her production obligations in this matter, and has failed
to comply with her production obligations with this very subject matter. See Document Request
No. 17 from Ms. Giuffre's Second Request for Production of Documents to Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell.' Maxwell has not produced all "URL or Internet addresses for any internet version of
such publication" that she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to send.
' Request No. 17 stated: Produce all documents concerning any statement made by You or on
Your behalf to the press or any other group or individual, including draft statements, concerning
Ms. Giuffre, by You, Ross Gow, or any other individual, from 2005 to the present, including the
dates of any publications, and if published online, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URL)
address. In response, Defendant stated: "Ms. Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that
it is cumulative and duplicative. Ms. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it calls
for information that exists within the public domain, the internet or in public court records and
which are equally available to both parties and can be obtained from some other source that is
more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive. Ms. Maxwell further objects to this
Request to the extent it seeks documents or information protected by the attorney/client
privilege, the work-product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege. Ms. Maxwell is not
producing documents that are available in the public domain. Ms. Maxwell has been unable to
locate any additional documents responsive to this Request."

This document is CONFIDENTIAL under the Court's Protective Order (DE 62)
Ms. Giuffre further objects because the information requested above is in the possession
of Defendant's agent, who caused the false statements to be issued to various media outlets. Ms.
Giuffre has not had the opportunity to depose Maxwell's agent Ross Gow; therefore, this answer
remains incomplete. Consequently, Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or supplement
her responses, as information is largely in the possession of the Defendant and her agent.
Ms. Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in that it violates Rule 33 as its subparts, in
combination with the other interrogatories, exceed the allowable twenty-five interrogatories. Ms.
Giuffre objects to this request because it is in the public domain. Ms. Giuffre also objects in that
it seeks information protected by the attorney-client/work product privilege, and any other
applicable privilege stated in the General Objections.
Notwithstanding such objections, Ms. Giuffre has already produced documents
responsive to this request; Bates labelled GIUFFRE000001 to GIUFFRE007566, and
supplements such responsive documents with the following list of publications. While the
identification of an exhaustive responsive list would be unduly burdensome, in an effort to make
a good faith effort towards compliance, Ms. Giuffre provides the following examples, which are
incomplete based on the aforementioned reasons:

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by
Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are
not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms. Roberts that Alan
Dershowitz is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies.
Ms. Roberts's claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not
publicized as news, as they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the
same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have

Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff,
Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
PLAINTIFF'S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO
DEFENDANT'S INTERROGATORIES 6, 12 and 13
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26, 33, 34, Plaintiff hereby serves her
supplemental responses to Defendant's Interrogatories 6, 12 and 13.
OBJECTIONS
Plaintiff maintains and hereby incorporates by reference all applicable objections,
including both general objections and specific objections to individual interrogatories, in her
prior responses and objections served on Defendant in these supplemental responses.
Defendant's Discovery Requests violate Rule 33, Fed. R. Civ. P., which provides "a party
may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts" -
in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in
violation of Rule 33.
Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant's Discovery Requests to the extent they seek
information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to, attorney
client privilege, work product privilege, and any other applicable privilege.

Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656-CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of
Florida). Accordingly, due to the undue burden of individually logging responsive, privileged
documents related to Defendant's overly-broad requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging
of such privileged responsive documents pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c).
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole purpose
of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a minor victim of sexual trafficking.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent they are overly broad and unduly
burdensome.
Ms. Giuffre's responses to Defendant's Second Set of Discovery Requests are being
made after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information
and documentation that is presently known to her. Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify
and/or supplement her responses. Ms. Giuffre has produced documents and information in
response to these Requests.
Ms. Giuffre incorporates her above-listed general objections in the responses herein.
SUPPLEMENTAL INTEROGATORY RESPONSES

"published globally, including within the Southern District of New York" as You contend in
paragraph 9 of Court 1 of Your Complaint, including:

the date of its publication;
C.
the publishing entity and title of any publication containing the purportedly false
statement;
d.

VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,

----^
Declaration of Philip Barden
I, Philip Barden, declare as follows:
1. I am a Solicitor of the Senior Courts of England & Wales based in London, England.
2. I am submitting this Declaration in support of Ghislaine Maxwell's motion for
summary judgment in this action.
3.
I am not authorised to and do not waive Ms. Maxwell's attorney-client privilege.
4. I have represented Ms. Maxwell since 2011 regarding the allegations made by
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre and as published in the United Kingdom. I continue to be retained in
this regard. I am familiar generally with the subject matter of this action.
5.
I first represented Ms. Maxwell in this matter over the weekend of 5t* and 6h March
2011, about the time when various UK national newspapers, in hard copy and on line, published
numerous and provocative allegations made by the Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre against
Ms. Maxwell. The articles by Sharon Churcher were among those published in this time frame.
6.
I instructed British press agent Ross Gow to assist me in representing Ms. Maxwell.
1


Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page86 of 648
7. I caused to be prepared a statement to respond to the articles that appeared in the
British Press over the weekend-March 5 and 6, 2011, and thereafter. I directed Mr. Gow to
distribute the statements to various media outlets that had published articles.
8. On December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre made numerous salacious and improper
allegations against Ms. Maxwell in a joinder motion publicly filed in a civil case involving
Jeffrey Epstein. Shortly afterward, the British media gained access to the motion and began
inquiring about Ms. Maxwell's response.
9. I continued to represent Ms. Maxwell at that time and I coordinated the response to
the media. I again instructed Mr. Gow to assist me.
10. In liaison with Mr. Gow and my client, on January 2, 2015, I prepared a further
statement denying the allegations, and I instructed Mr. Gow to transmit it via email to members
of the British media who had made inquiry about plaintiff's allegations about Ms. Maxwell.
Attached as Exhibit Al is an email containing a true and correct copy of this statement. The
statement was issued on my authority. Although it is possible others suggested or contributed
content, I prepared the vast majority of the statement and ultimately approved and adopted all of
the statement as my work.
11. As is evident from the timing and the typographical errors in the statement,
I prepared the statement in haste. I was not in the office on 2"d January 2015 as it was the Friday
immediately after New Years day which is a public holiday. Most people took 2"d January off
and many business closed that day. I don't now recall where I was that day but I was hard to
reach and that indicates I was out with my family. I therefore would have prepared the statement
in a hurry. I recall that I wanted to get a statement out as a matter of urgency.
12.
I recall that immediately after Ms. Giuffre's motion was filed, media representatives
began contacting Mr. Gow and requesting Ms. Maxwell's response to Ms. Giuffre's allegations


Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page87 of 648
of criminal and other misconduct by Ms. Maxwell. I believed an immediate response was
imperative, even though this was happening in the midst of the holidays in the United Kingdom.
My communications with Mr. Gow and with Ms. Maxwell were sporadic, delayed and hurried
because of my and their own holiday schedules. I worked while on vacation and on Friday,
January 2, 2015, to ensure that the statement was issued as soon as possible after receiving the
media inquiries.
13. I did not ask Ms. Maxwell to respond point by point to Ms. Giuffre's factual
allegations in the CVRA joinder motion. What we needed to do was issue an immediate denial
and that necessarily had to be short and to the point. It should have been obvious to the media
that Ms. Giuffre's new and significantly more salacious allegations had no credibility because
they differed so substantially from her previous allegations, when she had the opportunity and
incentive to disclose all relevant facts about being a victim of alleged sexual abuse and sex
trafficking at the hands of the rich and powerful. I prepared the January 2015 statement based on
my knowledge of Ms. Giuffre's past statements and her most recent statements in the joinder
motion, and made the point to the media-recipients that she and her new statements, which
differed so substantially from her former ones, were not credible-specifically, that the new
allegations were patently false—i.e., "obvious lies."
14. By way of example I recall that prior to the December 2014 filing of the joinder
motion and the subsequent press reports that Ms. Guiffre clearly stated she had not had sex with
Prince Andrew. Yet in her joinder motion she claimed she did have sex with Prince Andrew and
that the sex occurred in what can only be described as a very small bathtub, too small for a man
of Prince Andrew's size to enjoy a bath in let alone sex. So as of December 2014 it was clear
Ms. Guiffre had made polar opposite statements. She was either lying when she said they did not
have sex or when she said they did. I made the inescapable inference that she is a liar, as clearly
3


Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page88 of 648
she is, since both statements cannot as a matter of fact be true. When someone says she did not
have sex and then says she did, in other words, there is an obvious lie.
15. I did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely to
disseminate information to the media. This is why I intentionally did not request that Mr. Gow or
any other public relations specialist prepare or participate in preparing the statement. Instead,
Mr. Gow served as my conduit to the media representatives who had requested a response to the
joinder motion allegations and who I believed might republish those allegations.
16. My purpose in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated to those
media representatives was twofold. First, I wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's
reputation from the press's republication of plaintiff's false allegations. I believed these ends
could be accomplished by suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject
plaintiff's allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. For example, I noted that plaintiff's allegations
changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they are "obvious lies" and therefore should not
be "publicised as news."
17. Second, I intended the January 2015 statement to be "a shot across the bow" of the
media, which I believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations without
conducting any inquiry of their own. This was the purpose of repeatedly stating that plaintiff's
allegations were "defamatory." In this sense, the statement was very much intended as a cease
and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the seriousness
with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false allegations and
the legal indefensibility of their own conduct.
18.
It is important to understand that any story involving a member of the Royal Family,
especially a senior member such as Prince Andrew, gains huge media attention in the UK and a
story alleging he had a sex with the Plaintiff caused a feeding frenzy for the press. I wanted the
4


Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page89 of 648
press to stop and think before publishing, to cease and desist, and that if they continued then they
faced higher damages for ignoring my clear warning.
19. Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow's emails prefaced the statement with
the following language: "Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell"
(italics supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-time-only, comprehensive
response quoted in full, if it was to be used to plaintiff's December 30, 2014, allegations that
would give the media Ms. Maxwell's response. The purpose of the prefatory statement was to
inform the media-recipients of this intent.
20. Selective and partial quotation and use of the statement would disserve my purposes.
It was intended to address Plaintiff's behavior and allegations against Ms. Maxwell on a broad
scale, that is to say, Plaintiff's history of making false allegations and innuendo to the media
against Ms. Maxwell. This is why the statement references Plaintiff's "original allegations" and
points out that her story "changes"—i.e. is embellished over time including the allegations
"now" that Professor Dershowitz allegedly had sexual relations with her. This is why I
distinguished in the statement between Plaintiff's "original" allegations and her "new," joinder-
motion allegations, which differed substantially from the original allegations. And this is why I
wrote, "Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about public
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by [Plaintiff] that Alan Derschowitz [sic] is
involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies." (Emphasis supplied.) Having
established the dramatic difference between Plaintiff's two sets of allegations, which suggested
she was fabricating more and more-salacious allegations as she had more time to manufacture
them, I added the third paragraph: "[Ms. Giuffre's] claims are obvious lies and should be treated
as such and not publicised as news, as they are defamatory." (Emphasis supplied.) I believed
then, and believe now, that it was and remains a fair inference and conclusion that her claims
5


Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page90 of 648
were and are "obvious lies." As noted, her claims not to have slept with Prince Andrew and to
have slept with Prince Andrew are a classic example of an obvious lie. One or other account is
on the face of it a lie.
21. As an example of her lack of credibility, the Plaintiff made allegations against
Professor Dershowitz, which I understand she has now withdrawn. Professor Dershowitz has
credibility because his story, insofar as I am familiar with it, has been consistent; Ms. Giuffre has
no credibility because her story has shifted and changed.
22. Further the Plaintiff's account has become more salacious, for example, regarding
Prince Andrew. The Plaintiff clearly has been seeking publicity for her story and it is clear to me
that she understands retelling the same story doesn't feed the media and generate publicity and
so each time she appears to create new allegations to generate media interest.
23. I understand the Plaintiff alleged in her Complaint in this action that the following
statements are defamatory. She alleges it was defamatory in the first paragraph of the January
2015 statement to state that "the allegations made by [the Plaintiff] against [Ms.] Maxwell are
untrue." For the reasons stated above, it was and is my considered and firm opinion that, in fact,
her allegations are untrue. She alleges it was defamatory to state in the same paragraph that the
"original allegations" have been "shown to be untrue." For the reasons stated above, it was and is
my considered and firm opinion that, in fact, her allegations are untrue. Finally, she alleges that it
was defamatory in the third paragraph to state that her claims are "obvious lies." For the reasons
stated above, it was and is my considered and firm opinion that, in fact, her claims are obvious
lies.
24. Both Mr. Gow and I understood that once the January 2015 statement was sent to the
media-representatives, we had no ability to control whether or how they would use the statement
and we made no effort to control whether or how they would use the statement.
6


Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page91 of 648
25. It is my understanding that some of the media-recipients of the January 2015
statement did not publish any part of the statement. I am unaware of any media-recipient
publishing the statement in full.
26. The issuance of the statement fully complied with my ethical obligations as a lawyer.
Indeed it was duty in representing my client's interests to ensure that a denial was immediately
issued. I would have been remiss if I had sat back and not issued a denial, and the press had
published that Ms. Maxwell had not responded to enquiries and had not denied the new
allegations; the public might have taken the silence as an admission there was some truth in the
allegations.
27. The content of the statement was entirely based on information I acquired in
connection with my role as counsel for Ms. Maxwell.
28. At the time I directed the issuance of the statement, I was contemplating litigation
against the press-recipients as an additional means to mitigate and prevent harm to Ms. Maxwell.
Whilst the limitation period for a pure defamation claim has now expired, claims are still being
considered for example for publishing a deliberate falsehood, conspiracy to inure and other
tortious acts.
29. In any such UK defamation, or other related, action Ms. Giuffre would be a
defendant or a witness.
30.
I directed that the statement indicate Ms. Maxwell "strongly denie[d] the allegations
of an unsavoury nature," declare the allegations to be false, give the press-recipients notice that
the publications of the allegations "are defamatory," and inform them that Ms. Maxwell was
"reserv[ing] her right to seek redress."

Q
Okay.
Where is Ms.
now?
A
I believe Broward County.
How is it that she came to introduce you to
Ms. Roberts?.
A
She brought her to the house.
And do you know
how they were friends?
A
They met each other in rehab.
What kind of rehab?
A
I'm not sure. I was living in Miami at the
time, and I only came up once in a while to visit her. At
the very end, when
I moved back to Broward with my dad,
that's when
home.
Do you know the name of the rehab program?
A
NO.
& And you do you know what the rehab program was
for, drugs, alcohol?
A
I don't know. I guess, everything probably.
• Do you recall
approximately what year you met
Ms. Roberts?
A
I believe around '98.
How old were you at that time?
A
18.
Do you know how old Ms. Roberts was?

working at the Taco Bell in Sunrise. Did I get that
right?
A
Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Did Ms. Roberts come to work at the Taco
Bell where you worked?
A
Not at that one in Sunrise. When we moved to
Broward, she worked with me. I think it was another one
in Sunrise.
Okay. So you're saying sometime later you and
Ms. Roberts moved to Broward. Is that right?
A
Yes, we lived in an apartment.
Where was that apartment?
A
Oakland Park, I believe.
And when you moved to that apartment in Oakland
Park, that's when she came to work with you at Taco Bell?
A
Yes.
Do you know about how old you were when that
happened?
A
It had to be around -- it wasn't long after
meeting her.
Why don't you take a step back and tell me what
you recall about meeting Ms. Roberts.
A
It was a long time ago.
I understand.
All I remember is my sister bringing her over

one day, we got to talking, we liked each other, and we
just got to know each other.
Was she in school at the time?
A
NO.
Why not?
A
I'm not entirely sure.
Was she done with this rehab program?
A
Yes, at the time.
Did she go back into it later?
Not that I know of.
So your understanding is, she was not in school
and not in the rehab program at the time that you met
Ms. Roberts. Correct?
A
Not that I know of, no.
Where was she living when you met Ms. Roberts?
A
She was staying with us - or she came over, and
then I guess she was staying with us for a little while, I
believe.
And who do you mean by "us"?
A
At my dad's house.
Who else was living there besides yourself, your
dad and your sister?
A
My step-mom, my other step-sister, my
step-brother and their grandmother. It was a big house.

that house with the family?
A
No idea. Not long.
Weeks, months, years?
A
Weeks.
Okay. You said that you spent some time getting
to know Ms. Roberts when you first talked to her?
A
Uh-hmm.
Did she tell you anything about her childhood?
A
If she did, I don't remember, it was so long
ago.
A
A
Do you recall meeting her parents?
Yes.
Was that some time later?
Yes.
Tell me about when you remember meeting her
parents.
A
I think that was -- all I remember - really,
all I remember is going to the house and meeting her
parents. I don't remember much from that time.
Okay. I appreciate that this is all a long time
ago
A
Yeah.
Did you and Ms. Roberts become a couple soon
after you met her?
Yes.

Was she dating anyone else at that time?
A
No.
Tell me where you -- did you both move out of
that home, your dad's home, together?
A
Yes.
And where did you go directly after that home?
To the Oakland Park apartment.
At the time you got the Oakland Park apartment,
do you recall how old you were?
A
I had to be 18 to get an apartment.
Okay. And do you know how old Ms. Roberts was?
A
16.
A
Is that a guess, or do you remember?
That's a guess.
Do you think you are about two years older than
she is?
A
About. Maybe a little more.
Okay. How long did you two live together at the
Oakland Park apartment?
A
Less - I know it wasn't a full year. I don't
know exactly how long it was. I don't know how many
months it was.
Did anyone else live there with you?
A
Yes, a roommate.
Who was that?

A
Mario. Last name, I can't remember. I haven't
seen him since that apartment.
Was he a friend of yours or hers, or just
someone else?
A He was a friend of mine. He worked with me at
Taco Bell.
And after you moved to this Oakland Park
apartment, Ms. Roberts came to work at the Taco Bell as
well?
A
A
A
A
A
A
A
Yeah, with him and me.
Do you recall where that Taco Bell was?
By the Sawgrass Mall.
How long did Ms. Roberts work at that Taco Bell?
I don't remember.
You were a manager at the time?
Yes, me and my roommate.
You were both managers?
Yeah.
Was she an official employee?
Yes.
She was on the payroll?
Yes.
And you were the manager?
Um-hmm?
And she paid -- she was paid for by Taco Bell?

A
Yes.
l
Was it is a franchise, if you know?
A
I know when I first started there, they were
corporate, but then they were a franchise. They were
bought out. But I'm not sure if when I got there they
were a franchise or not.
Got it.
Do you know if Ms. Roberts had any previous
employment before she worked at Taco Bell?
A
I think by the apartment, she worked for KFC for
a little while.
MS. MENNINGER: Are you looking at Ms.
Roberts?
THE WITNESS: I'm thinking. I can't
remember. I remember something with KFC. They
had one really close to us. I think she worked
there for a tiny, tiny bit. I'm not sure.
MS. MENNINGER: Okay.
BY MS. MENNINGER:
Before the Taco Bell?
A
Or she could've applied there. It's just in my
head. She might have just applied there, and didn't get
it, and that's why I brought her to Taco Bell.
Okay.
Because we were both the night managers.

Okay. Got it.
So for not a full year, the two of you worked
together at a Taco bell near the Sawgrass Mills (as
heard) and lived in an apartment in Oakland Park?
A
Yes.
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
BY MS. MENNINGER:
With Mario?
A
Yeah.
Did Mario live there the whole time?
A
Yes.
What caused you to stop living at the Oakland
Park apartment?
A I don't remember exactly. But I know we moved
out before, and Mario stayed in the apartment.
Where did you move to?
A
Her parent's house.
Did you move into the house or to someplace near
the house?
A
I don't remember if we originally moved into the
house. But I know they had a trailer in the back that we
lived in.
How long did you live in the trailer in the
back?
No idea.

A
A
No.
Do you know about what years this was?
Not really.
Do you know about how old you were?
When, what?
I'm just focused on the period of time in which
you were living at her parent's house in the trailer.
A
I was probably 18 when we moved in there.
And you said you were only there for a couple of
months?
A
Not that I remember. Like, it might have been a
little longer. I'm not sure.
Were you engaged to Ms. Roberts?
A
Yes.
When did you become engaged to her?
A
When we were living in Oakland Park.
Tell me about the engagement. How did it come
about?
A
Well, we fell in love, and -- I believe it was
Valentine's Day when I proposed.
A
A
Did you have a ring?
Yes.
Did she accept?
Yes.
How long were you engaged?

A
I'm not entirely sure.
Do you remember an event where the engagement
was broken off?
A
When I left.
Left where?
A
When I left - Royal Palm Beach, I guess, was
our apartment.
When you left that apartment, that's when the
engagement was over in your mind?
A
Yes.
A
Were your families happy about the engagement?
Yes. My mother was. My dad wasn't too happy.
Have you ever been married since then?
A
No.
Have you ever been engaged since then?
A
No.
Do you know what happened to the ring?
Yes.
Where is it?
A
I have it.
Still?
A
Yeah. It was my grandmother's.
Did you get down on one knee?
A
Yes, at the beach, I believe.

So from about the ages you were 18 to 20 is when
you were living together with Virginia?
A
Yeah.
And between the time you met her at your dad's
house and the time that you broke up, did you guys break
up and get back together, or was it one consistent
relationship, and then it had an end date?
A
Yeah, one consistent relationship.
Okay. You mentioned that you moved into an
apartment in Royal Palm Beach?
A
Yeah, I believe that's where it was, Royal Palm
Beach.
A
A
A
A
Do you remember anything about the apartment?
All I remember, it was on the third floor.
And who got that apartment?
I did.
Again, you were over 18 at that time?
Yes.
So you got the lease?
Yes.
Do you remember looking for the apartment?
I believe so.
And it wasn't the first apartment you rented,
right?
No. No, the one in Oakland Park was the first

MS. MENNINGER: I'm going to show you some
photographs. If I could have you mark this. I
guess we'll start again with, I guess we'll start
again with Defendant's Exhibit -- I got one for
you. Defendant's Exhibit 1 or A, whatever you put
on it.

MS. MENNINGER: Exhibit 1.

BY MS. MENNINGER:
• Please take a look at this. There are two
photographs stapled together.
Does that look like the apartment that you
lived in on the third floor?
It could be. I don't really remember it.
The address on this is 368 Bent Oak.
Does that
sound about right?
A
Bent Oak sounds familiar.
You don't recognize the -- it may have been
painted, for example?
A
Yeah. I mean, all I remember is being on the
third floor.

there's emergency contact information that says "James
Austrich".

A
A
Do you see that?
Yes.
Is that you?
Yes.
And it says 368 Bent Oak Drive below that?
Yes.
Does that refresh your memory as to the address,
the apartment that you lived in in Royal Palm Beach?
A
Like I said, Bent Oak sounds very familiar, and
I know it was Royal Palm Beach. So possibly it was that
one.
Okay. And how long do you think that you lived
in this apartment?
A
I'm not entirely sure. Less than a year, that's

in touch.

there, I didn't really talk to anybody from up
there. I remember somewhat of that. Yeah, I
remember the cops telling me even though it was
under my name, I couldn't go in. And I think
later on then they got out so I could go back and
get me stuff. I think I was going to see my
animals.

• Yeah. I didn't know if reading this might cause
you to remember some things.
A
I somewhat remember that. I remember the cops
coming and telling me I wasn't allowed to go in my own
apartment that was under my name.
Okay. So this
is dated June 10th, of 2001. And
it places you at 368 Bent Oak Drive, correct?
A
Yes.
Okay. Do you understand that to likely be where
you were living with Ms. Roberts?
A
Yeah. But at the time I was already back in
Broward.
Okay. Do you know how long you had been back in
Broward?
Not a clue.
And in this, it refers to Ms. Roberts as your
ex-fiancé, correct?
A
Yes.
So presumably the event you described where you
had a fight and left had already occurred?
A
Yes.

THE WITNESS: I know I was already out of
there. And that's why when I went back, that's

apartment.
BY MS. MENNINGER:
So your recollection today is that you were
returning to that apartment to either get things or check
on pets?
A
Yes.
What pets do you recall having?
A
A dog and six cats and, I believe, ferrets and
rabbits. One reason we got along so well is because we
liked animals.
And do you remember going back to the apartment
to check on the pets and encountering Ms. Roberts and
Tony?
A
Yeah.
Were you inside the apartment when you
encountered them?
No, outside.
Did you understand them to be living in the
apartment at that time?
A
Yes.
In the police report it says "Austrich stated
his ex-fiance, Virginia Roberts, who also resides at the
above-listed address, brought her friend to the
apartment."

A
I believe that was Tony.
l
Okay. And at this time, the police are
indicating that you both lived there. But that's not what
you remember?
A
No. They wouldn't even let me -- all I
remember -- I remember being outside the door and the cops
wouldn't let me go in there because - even though it was
my apartment and my address was on the thing, I wasn't
allowed in there. Because I'm pretty sure I wasn't living
there. I just came back to get something.
Do you know how long after you left you were
coming back to get something?
A
I don't remember.
• If you left your pets
there, I guess, I'm just
wondering whether you intended to go back and get your
pets?
A
I couldn't because my dad didn't -- my dad
didn't really take -- like, he didn't want all those
animals. Because he already had three dogs and he wasn't
a fan of cats.
MR. EDWARDS: Or ferrets.
A
(cont'd) Or ferrets or rabbits. I think we had
a gerbil, mice, rats, all kinds of stuff. I know we had
pet store cages that we bought to keep them all in.
Because when we lived in West Palm Beach it was like a

little animal rescue for a while.
Did you get that stuff from the pet store where
you both had worked?
A
Yes.
A discount, I hope?
A
I feel like every time I went to the pet store,
I got a new animal. Still do the same thing.
Do you have pets today?
A
Oh, yeah. I have dogs.
have six cats and three birds.
I have two dogs.
We
No reptiles?
A
No. No, I don't really like ---
Is that a different kind of pet owner?
A
Well, I had reptiles in West Palm Beach.
They
are too hard to take care of.
Spiders?
A No, I don't want to be -- I have enough spiders
where I live. I don't need pet spiders.
Okay. All right.
Do you remember Tony punching you in the
face?
A
I don't remember.
You see that's what the police report says?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He might have. I don't

And the police observed you to have minor
swelling and a large red mark. Does that sound accurate?
A
From according to what it says, yeah. I don't
really remember that. I remember being at the door and
the cops coming and telling me I can't go in there. Once
I read that, that's really all I remember.
Do you believe that whatever altercation you had
took place within the apartment or outside the apartment?
In the doorway at the most. I never went inside
that apartment when that was happening, not I remember.
Do you ever get to see those pets again?
A
Yes. I think later on, they both left for the
day and let me go in and see my pets.
Now, this indicates
that the police were there
at about 9:20 in the evening, and you were there with
Mr. Perkins. But you don't remember Mr. Perkins?
A
No. If it would have said "Josh" I think that
might be a name I remember. But John -- I know we had two
friends up there. John could have been one of them, but I
don't really remember. John Perkins. That's so weird.
The police report also indicates that
Mr. Figueroa observed Perkins on the telephone and fled
the scene prior to arrival. Do you remember that?
A
No. I don't remember "Perkins". As soon as I
saw that name, I'm like "Who the hell is John Perkins?"

All right. If you can turn to the next page.
The police report continues that they made numerous
attempts
to contact you and Mr. Perkins, whoever he is --
A
Yeah.
-- and Ms. Roberts at the residence or on the
phone, but had not been able to do that?
A
If they called the residence, I wasn't living
there. And I don't remember them ever trying to call me
in Broward.
• Do you know if you had a cell phone? This was
back in '01. I don't even know if I had a cellphone in
'01?
A
Yeah, I really couldn't tell ya'.
Okay. So your best recollection, after
reviewing this report, is that you had left on a previous
date and came back on this date to see your pets?
A
Yeah, yeah.
And that you were ultimately able to get in and
see the pets?
A
Later on, yes.
Okay. Like, the same day or --
A
Later on. I don't really remember how much
longer --- how many days later, or something. Not too
long.
And when you came back at that later time, you

No, nobody was in the house but my animals.
• And since that time you have not had any contact
with Ms. Roberts?
A
No.

MR. EDWARDS: Form.
THE WITNESS: An idiot. That's all I really

Did you believe him to be using drugs?

Actions.

Sorry.

You're still under oath, do you remember?
A
Yes.
Okay. So you were referring a little bit to the
time that Ms. Roberts worked for Jeff?
A
Yes.
You knew him as Jeff or Jeffrey?
A
I remember Jeff. It could have been Jeffrey.
Okay. Tell me what you recall about Ms. Roberts
going to work for Jeff.
A
I don't remember much of it, really. All I
remember is that she went to work for him. I know they
went to some island. I know they traveled around. And he
had a house in Palm Beach I think it was.
Did she tell you what she was doing for Jeff?
At the beginning, it was massage. That's what I

was told.

A
A

By her?
Yes.
Okay. Did she seem excited about that job?
Yes.
Was she getting paid more money?
Yes.

So she hadn't come to you before that and said,
"Hey, I'm having to do something other than massages"?
A
I don't remember.
A
She may have; she may not have?
Yeah. I don't remember.
well, why would you be fighting about it at the
end?
A
the idiot.
Well, that's because she was messing with Tony,
So the fight --
A
I mean, that's what he - the fight's what
brought everything out.
Okay. So she was messing with Tony, the idiot,
and you guys got in a fight about her messing with Tony?
A
I think that's what it originally it was.
Because she was supposed to come home, and I think she
went over there instead. That's when I found out --
that's when I found out about that, with the idiot. Then,
I believe the other stuff came to light. I don't really
remember.
As you sit here, you think that's when you were
finding out about all of this at the same time?
A
I believe so, but I don't really remember.
Do you know where Tony lived?
A
Somewhere around there, where our other

You had trouble figuring out what was the truth?
A
Yeah. But I know for sure she was with the
idiot,
so that's the main reason.
well, you saw her with him, right?
A
Well, I found out that she was in town, but not
here, and that's when I found out.
Okay. Not at home - not at your home?
A
Yeah.
When you believed yourself to be engaged?

Yes.
Okay. She was not truthful with you about her
whereabouts?

about being forced to do things --
A
No. She might have told me some stuff, but
what, I don't remember really. Who knows if it was the
truth at the time anyway.
• And you weren't doing drugs at that time?
A
I wouldn't say no. I know at the end, I was
smoking a lot. And I might have been doing some other
stuff. I'm not sure.
Okay. Regardless, you would not have been
comfortable believing your fiancé was having sex with
other people?

No.
Did she, Ms. Roberts ever tell you that she was
posing naked for photographs?
No.
Would you have been okay with her posing naked
for photographs?
No.
Did Ms. Roberts ever mention Ghislaine Maxwell,
my client?
If she did, I don't remember the name. Like I
said, I only remember Jeff. That name is all I really
remember.
Because you don't remember Ms. Maxwell's name, I
assume you don't remember Ms. Roberts telling you that

January 19th, 2015?
A
At the very top of the page it says
January 21st, 2015.
The date it was filed. Is there a date
just above the signature block?
A
Oh, yes, sorry. Yes, there is.
And what date -- what date was that?
The 19th day of January, 2015.
Okay. And this document is something that
you believe contains the truth, correct?
A
To the best of my knowledge at the time,
yes.
All right. Did something change between
the time then and today that makes you believe that
it's not all accurate?
well, as you can see, in line 4 on page 1,
I wasn't aware of my dates. I was just doing the
best to guesstimate when I actually met them.
Since then I've been able to find out that
through my Mar-a-Lago records that it was actually
the summer of 2000, not the summer of 1999.
oh, I'm sorry. Are you back on page 1?
A
On the first page.
Okay.
A
Yes.

You can answer.
A
In approximately 1999 when I was 15 years
old I met Ghislaine Maxwell.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay.
A
I now know that it was 2000, that I was 16
years old when I met Ghislaine Maxwell.
So when you signed this document under
penalty of perjury stating that it was true, you no
longer believe that to be true, correct?
A
It was an honest mistake. We had no idea
how to pinpoint without any kind of records or dates
or anything like that. I was just going back
chronologically through time. And that's the best
time that I thought it was. And now I know the
facts, so it's good to know.
So you now believe that a document you

filed under oath is no longer true, correct?
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
I wouldn't say that it wasn't true. I was
just unaware of the times and the dates.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Again, is there more
than one truth, Ms. Roberts?
A
No, there's no more than one truth.
All right. So a document in which you
swore that you were 15 years old when you met
Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell is an untrue statement,
correct?
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
A
It's not that it's an untrue statement.
It was a mistake. So it wasn't intentionally trying
to say something that wasn't true. It was to my best
knowledge that I thought it was 1999. And when I got
my records from Mar-a-Lago I was able to find out
that it was 2000. And this was entered before I
found out the actual dates that I did work at
Mar-a-Lago.
(BY MS. MENNINGER)
Okay. So a document
that you filed under oath --
A
Um-hum.
-- is now, you believe to be untrue,
correct?

MR. EDWARDS: Objection. Asked and

(BY MS. MENNINGER) You may answer.
MR. EDWARDS: Answer again.
A
Again, I wouldn't say it's untrue. Untrue
would mean that I would have lied. And I didn't lie.
This was my best knowledge at the time. And I did my
very best to try to pinpoint time periods going back
such a long time ago.
It wasn't until I found the facts that I
worked at Mar-a-Lago in 2000 that I was able to
figure that out.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) And approximately when
did you learn those facts about the dates you worked
at Mar-a-Lago?
A
I would say it was mid-2015.
Mid-2015 is the first time you became
aware of the dates --
A
I don't know the exact --
A
If you could just let me finish.
I'm sorry.
That's all right. Approximately mid-2015
when you learned the true dates that you had worked
at Mar-a-Lago?
A
That's correct.
Sorry.

a lot of the circumstances that I had been subjected
to, I decided I wanted to get my GED.
Okay. So you were going to an actual
school to get your GED, that's what you're saying?
A
Yes.
And that school, whatever it was, where
you were getting your GED was not Palm Beach High
School, right?
A
No.
And it -- whatever the school was where
you were getting your GED took a summer break?
A
I believe so, yes.
And that was in 2000?

Now that we know the right dates, yes.
And that's when your dad helped you get a
quote-unquote summer job?
Yes.

Mar-a-Lago?

Yes.
Okay. Now tell me how you sort of came
into Mar-a-Lago for the first time? He asked you to
come? They called you? What happened?

My dad was very liked there. So I think
he talked to the people who were in HR. And then

first full paragraph on that page?
A
I do.
The first line begins: I spent my sweet
16th birthday on his island in the Caribbean next to
Little (sic) St. James Isle. He liked to call it
Little St. Jeff's. His ego was enormous as his
appetite for fornicating.
Do you see that sentence?
A
I do.
That is not true, correct? You were not
spending your sweet 16th birthday on Little St. James
Isle, correct?
A
Based on my knowledge at the time that I
wrote this manuscript, I thought I did spend my 16th
birthday there. And so I put it down in there as
that. Now I know that it wasn't my 16th birthday.
Or your sweet 16th birthday?

did you spend your sweet 16th birthday?

Again, I don't know.
Do you recall any present you actually got
on your sweet 16th birthday?
A
No, I don't. I don't know where I spent
it, who I spent it with or what I got. I'm sorry.
How long did you work at Mar-a-Lago?
A
Best of my recollection, it was a summer
job. I believe I started in June. And I think I
only worked there approximately two weeks, two, three
weeks.
How many hours a week did you work?
A
I want to say it was a -- I want to say
it's a full-time job.
Do you recall it being a full-time job?
A
It was a summer job, but just thinking
back, my dad used to bring me in and bring me home.
So he worked full time, all day. So -- and I didn't
lounge around Mar-a-Lago so, yes, I think it would
have been a full-time job.
And how much did you make per hour?
Approximately, I think I remember making
A
$9 an hour.
The bracelet and earrings you got for your
birthday, some birthday, on Little -- or where was
that birthday party, at Little St. James?

Which brother?
A
Sky.
What about your other brother?
A
I think he had moved out by then.
What forms of communication did you have?
Just a home phone number, or what?
A
Yeah, there was a home phone.
When do you recall ever getting a cell
phone?
A
The first cell phone I ever got was the
one that Ghislaine gave to me.
So you never had - your parents, did they
have ones when you were working at Mar-a-Lago?
A
No, my dad used to -- like, we had phones
in the spa and maintenance area and so on, so forth.
And you could, so to speak, page people from around
the courts.
Okay. So tell me what you recall of the
first conversation that you had with Ghislaine
Maxwell.
I'm sitting there reading my book about
massage therapy, as I'm working in the spa. And I'm

I believe Michael might have been living
with me at that time.
So he might have been there.
Do you recall if he was there when you got

I don't really remember. I remember what
I did when I got home, that I basically made a
beeline for the bathroom.

it.
He was somebody that helped me off the
streets so I felt compelled to say yes to him.
Okay. So when he proposed to you and you
said yes, did that take place before you started
working at Mar-a-Lago or after you started working at
Mar-a-Lago?
A
Before.
And so if he were living with your parents
at that time, you were living in the same room; is
that correct?
A
I believe so.
And your parents understood him to be your
fiance?
A
I don't think they agreed with it, but I
think they understood it as that. I mean --
I mean, you communicated to them that he
had proposed and you had accepted?
A
Yeah, in not such a pretty way. I mean,
they obviously weren't very happy about it. And it
wasn't my true intentions to ever marry him.
Okay.

But I did it to make him feel okay. I
didn't want to be mean.

sent to have sex with the owner of a large hotel
chain by Ghislaine Maxwell?

A
I believe that was one time in France.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Which time in France?
A
I believe it was around the same time that
Naomi Campbell had a birthday party.
Where did you have sex with the owner of a
large hotel chain in France around the time of Naomi
Campbell's birthday party?
In his own cabana townhouse thing. It was
part of a hotel, but I wouldn't call it a hotel.

I was instructed by Ghislaine to go and
give him an erotic massage.
She used the words erotic massage?
A
No, that's my word. The word massage is
what they would use. That's their code word.
Was she in the room when you gave this
erotic massage to the owner of a large hotel chain?

another prince, the large hotel chain owner and
Marvin Minsky, is there anyone else that Ghislaine
Maxwell directed you to go have sex with?
A
I am definitely sure there is. But can I
remember everybody's name?
No.
Okay. Can you remember anything else
about them?
A
Look, I've given you what I know right
now. I'm sorry. This is very hard for me and very
frustrating to have to go over this. I don't -- I
don't recall all of the people. There was a large
amount of people that I was sent to.
Do you have any notes of all these people
that you were sent to?

No, I don't.
Where are your notes?
I burned them.
when did you burn them?
In a bonfire when I lived at Titusville
because I was sick of going through this shit.
Q
Did you have lawyers who were representing
you at the time you built a bonfire and burned these
notes?
I've been represented for a long time, but
it was not under the instruction of my lawyers to do

this. My husband and I were pretty spiritual people
and we believed that these memories were worth
burning.
So you burned notes of the men with whom
you had sex while you were represented by counsel in
litigation, correct?
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
A
This wasn't anything that was a public
document. This was my own private journal, and I
didn't want it anymore. So we burned it.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) When did you write
that journal?

Just over time. I started writing it

Correct.
What did that journal look like?

It was green.
And what else?

It was just a spiral notebook.
Okay. And what did you put into that

Bad memories. Things that I've gone

A
So that's a different piece of paper?
Yeah, that's just random paper.
So you had a green spiral notebook that
you began sometime in 2011 or 2012 in which you wrote
down your recollections about what had happened to
you, and you burned that in a bonfire in 2013.
Did I get that right?
A
You got that right.
And do you have no other names of people
to whom you claim Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to
have sex, correct?

At this time, no.
Is there any document that would refresh
your recollection that you could look at?

me, I would be glad to look at it and tell you the
names I recognize off of that.

with Prince Andrew?

A
No. He went to everything that he was
supposed to go to.
Has he paid his fines?
A
yes, as far as I know.
Describe for me the contract that you had

Have you had more than one contract with
the Mail On Sunday?
A
well, there was one contract for the
picture. And that was to pay me 140,000 for the
picture. And then two stories were printed after
that for the amount of 10,000 each.
Is that the only money that you received
from the Mail On Sunday?
A
Correct.
Did you receive any money for syndication
of the photograph?
A
Isn't that what the 140 was for?
I'm asking you.
well, I don't really know what syndication
A
means.

Mail on Sunday?
A
Yes.
Where is that contract right now?
A
I don't know. I've moved that many times.
I -- I lose paperwork wherever I go.
Is it possible it's in the boxes in
Sydney?
A
I don't think I kept it, to be honest.
Did you ever refer back to it after you
signed it?
A
I know I kept it for a short while, but I
mean, like I said, I've moved countries twice in the
last two years and three different houses. So the
paper trail is lost. I don't know where it would be.
Did you receive it via e-mail?
No. I received it -- Sharon Churcher
handed it to me by paper.
And you signed it?
A
I signed it.
And then did you make a copy of it?
A
No.
A
You never had a copy of it?
Well, I had my own copy. I'm sure she has
hers.

BY MS. MENNINGER:
And where did you go after Royal Palm

Beach?
A
I believe it was South Area. I'm pretty
sure it was South Area.
Did you go to another school after that?
A
Yeah. I went to Gold Coast after that.
Is that also in Royal Palm Beach?
No. That's -- South Area was in Lake
Worth. Gold Coast is in West Palm. They were both
alternative schools.
Did you ever go to a Survivors Charter

School?
A
Yes. I went there, too.
When did you go there?
A
I'm not exactly sure of the date. But it
was somewhere after either -- I'm pretty sure it
was -- maybe -- I can't remember if it was Gold
Coast first or Survivor. But one of the -- I'm
trying to remember. I honestly don't remember which
one came first.
That's all right.
Can you describe for me Survivors Charter
School?
What is it like, or was it like?
A
I mean, like I said, it was an alternative

school. It was just pretty much a bunch of bad
kids, you know, who have gotten kicked out. And it
was pretty much like a last chance kind of school,
you know what I mean?
Does it look like a school?
A
Kind of. I mean, it had, like, a
cafeteria, and then it had a whole bunch of, like,
portables and stuff around there. And it was
under -- it was, like, right near the Lake Worth. I
remember there was, like, a bridge that went over
the interstate right by it. But, I mean, it was
just a little, you know, little crappy school.
Was it during the day or at night?
A
It was during the day.
So regular school hours?
A
Yeah. Well, it was actually a little bit
shorter hours. I can't remember exactly. But I
know it was not like the full days. Because, I
mean, at the alternative schools, it's obviously not
up to regular high school standards. I mean, they
just do pretty much stuff to get people to get out
of school, you know, so...
Get the credits that you need?
A
Yeah. So that way they can finish high
school and not drop out and whatnot, so...

You actually go there in the morning,
though, and take classes?
A
Yeah.
And get checked in at attendance?
A
Yeah.
And then you may leave a little earlier
than a regular school day?
Uh-huh (affirmative).
All right. It's not a online program?
No, it was not online.
When you were at Survivors Charter School,
did you ever see Ms. Roberts there?
A
Was it Survivors? I don't remember if it
was Survivors. Or was it -- because I'm pretty sure
we were both -- was
it -- I know we both went to one
of the schools. I'm pretty sure it was Survivors,
maybe.

those alternative schools that we went to, though.
Okay. Did you -- was Wellington an
alternative school?
No. Wellington is a -- is a real high

school, like a regular high school.
Do you know if Wellington has an adult
26
program?
A
They might. I mean, I really don't know.
I'm not sure.
Did you ever take night classes there?
A
No.
So you believe when you reunited with
Ms. Roberts in or around 2001, she had also gone to
one of those alternative schools?
A
When I reunited with her, no. We ended
up, like, trying to go finish school.
Tell me about that.
A
I mean, we just ended up going to one of
those alternative schools and didn't even finish
that.

Get better jobs?
A
Uh-huh (affirmative).
Things like -- that was the plan?
A
Yeah.
But it did not work out?
Yeah.
Do you know how long the two of you went
to Survivors Charter School?
A
I honestly don't remember.
Okay. You do have a recollection of going
with her, though?
A
Yeah.
Seeing her there?
A
Uh-huh (affirmative).
I'm trying to get a little bit of a time
frame on the time that you reunited with
Ms. Roberts. I know you said you lived - - you
remember being in an apartment with her in September
of 2000 -- 9/11/2001; right?
A
Yeah.
Do you think you had been together with
her for a while at that point?
A
It was probably, I'd say, like a month or

so. Like, I'm pretty sure. Because it was not too
long after I had moved in, so...
• And just to be clear, she already lived in
the apartment?
A
Yeah. She lived in the apartment with her
ex-boyfriend Michael and JJ. And I think there was
somebody else. I don't remember who, though.
All right. That's where she was living
when you reunited with her?
A
Yeah.
And then you moved in?
A
Yeah.
Did the other people move out?
A
Yeah. I kicked them out.
How long did you live there with
Ms. Roberts?
A
I think it was just till, like, the end of
the lease, so it was probably maybe, like, five or
six months. I'm pretty sure. I don't know. I'm
not exactly [sic] on the whole time frame.
That's okay. I understand it was a while
28
ago.
A
A
Yeah.
Where did you two move from there?
I believe we either -- we went to her --

it was either her family's house or mine. It was
either one of the two. And then we ended up getting
another -- we were renting a house out in
Loxahatchee also, eventually. But we also stayed in
a little trailer behind her parents' house.
When did your relationship with
Ms. Roberts end the second time?
A
When she went to Thailand and --
(Brief interruption.)
A
-- never heard from her again.
THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry. Can you
re-answer?
A
Yeah. When Jeffry sent her to Thailand.
And then I never heard from her again until
freaking, like, two days ago.
BY MS. MENNINGER:
You heard from her two days ago?
A
Yeah.
She had called me to apologize
about, obviously, everything about me getting
dragged into this mess. And we talked just pretty
much about, you know, the way shit ended, and pretty
much tried just -- her apologizing mainly about
dragging me all into this and having to make me
get -- you know, knowing how I have my family and
stuff now. And that was pretty much it, so...

Another instant connection.
A
Uh-huh (affirmative).
From the time Ms. Roberts left to go to
Thailand until today, have you seen her?
A
Nope.
And to be honest, it still does not even
feel real that she's sitting right there across from

But, like I said, it's just -- it
still does not seem like this is actually happening.
Like, she's -- I don't know. It's like talking to a
ghost or seeing one.
Does she look different now?
A
Yeah.
HOW?
A
Just more mature, more older.
When you were with Ms. Roberts the first
time in '98 --
A
Uh-huh (affirmative).
-- you believe that relationship lasted
just a couple of weeks?
A
Yeah. I'm not exactly sure, but it was
pretty brief.

What did she tell you about that?

I -- I think that maybe he -- I mean, I
don't know exactly. I don't really remember. I
remember hearing about him, but I don't remember
what she said about him.

it started becoming, like, an almost everyday thing
about -- just hearing about famous people with
Jeffrey and stuff like that, it's, like, I kind of
didn't, like, tone it out, but I just -- it became
normal, so I just stopped, like, listening to all

A
Well, that's what I'm saying. It was not
like I was drowning it out. It's just I knew that
she was with Jeffrey, and he was, obviously,
well-connected with everybody. So it was not like,
you know, a special occasion, per se. You know, it
was, but it's not like it was -- it was not very not
rare so...
Did she show you any photographs of
herself with famous people?
A
No.
Did you see a photograph of her with
Prince Andrew --
A
Yes.
-- in her possession?

BY MS. MENNINGER:
Mr. Figueroa, you mentioned that you and
Ms. Roberts attempted to go to back to school while
you were together --
A
Yes.
-- to get your GED?
Yeah. Yes.
And you believe that you went to the
Survivors Charter School?
A
Yes.
MS. MENNINGER: Okay. I'm going to mark
Defendant's Exhibit 6.
(Defendant's Exhibit 6 was marked for
identification.)
BY MS. MENNINGER:
This is a school record for Ms. Roberts
that lists the names of various schools. And --
A
So it was Survivors, obviously. That's
the only one on that list that isn't -- or that's
there that's on mine, as well.
Okay.
A
Other than the other ones, but...
All right. So you recognize Survivors
Charter School on Ms. Roberts' school records?
A
Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Since that

Okay. There is an entry date for
Ms. Roberts at Survivors Charter School of
10/12/2001, and a withdrawal on 3/7 of '02. Do you

So I'm just wanting to know if that's
consistent with your recollection, that you guys
went to school in the fall of 2001 until the --
A
Yeah, that sounds about right.
-- March of 2002. It sounds right?
A
Yeah.

Yes.
And you believe the Neiman Marcus was
located in which city?
A
Well, it's around Fort Lauderdale. I
can't tell you exactly. Fort Lauderdale is so big,
like Broward County? Is that the word for it?
And what did you do at Neiman Marcus?
A
I worked in the changing rooms.
And what did you do in the changing room?
A
I think I just like -- if I remember
right, I just put clothes away that people left in
there. Probably went out to get sizes, different
sizes for women who wanted different sizes of the
same product.
And where did you work after Neiman
Marcus?
A
Taco Bell.
Did you work at Southeast Employee
Management Company?
A
I don't recognize that. I don't know if
that's a payroll company or what it is. I don't know
what Southeast -- what is it called?
Southeast Employee Management Company.
A
No, I don't remember that.
Did you ever work as a temp?

that doesn't ring a bell.

Yes, I did.
What did you indicate?
A
I indicated that I attended Survivors
Charter School for four years and had a high school
diploma.
And you graduated?
A
well, I didn't. I just wanted to get a
job, and I wanted it to look good, so I fluffed it
up.
So you wrote that down in your handwriting
on this application, correct?
A
I did.
And it was not true, correct?
A
Again, I'm not proud of it. I just didn't
have any other way of getting a job and I just
thought if I put that down there, I might be
considered.
You indicated when you were younger you
volunteered for six years at a riding clinic. What's
the name of the riding clinic?

Vince Ramos. And I'm not too sure if it
was six years, but I started off there quite young,

EARNINGS RECORD INFORMATION
Date: 10/25/2016
Our records show the amount of earnings reported, not the amount of
Social Security taxes that were paid.
Wages were first covered under Social Security in 1937.
Therefore,
1937 is the first year for which earnings may be shown on our records.
Employers were required to report earnings semi-annually in 1937,
and on a quarterly basis for the years from 1938 through 1977
Beginning with 1978, employers are required to report earnings annually.
our records do not show the exact date of employment (month and day)
because we do not need this information to figure Social Security
benefits. Employers do not give us this information.
Each year, there is a maximum amount of earnings that is subject to
Social Security taxes and is used to compute benefits.
If a person
earns more than this maximum amount, the earnings statement will
usually show the maximum rather than the total earnings. Maximum
benefits can be found on the SSA website.
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html
Beginning in 1951, self-employed persons could also receive
Social Security credit for their work.
self-employment earnings that are subject to Social Security taxes
and are used to compute benefits can also be found on the SSA website.
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html
If you have any questions, you should call, write,
or visit any
Social Security office.
If you visit or call, please bring this letter.
It will help us answer questions.
The toll free number to call is

To Whom It May Concern,
Skye Roberts has been a most valuable employee at The Mar-a-Lago Club since
April of 2000. While employed as a maintenance crew team member, he has been
responsible for maintaining the five championship red-clay tennis courts as well as
keeping all of the individual air conditioning units working and in tip-top shape.
It is my understanding that Skye is relocating to Colorado. Should he ever return to
Florida, he would be eligible for re-hire.

Do you remember there being a job posting that
you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just
go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your
own?
A
I just talked to Angela.
Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended
to be a full-time job?
A
I don't remember if it was full time or just
summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably
for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal.
I mean, I was there year round but a lot of
people are seasonal, you know, because it's like
snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to
be down in south Florida.
What would you call the season, the seasonal
aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season?
A
Probably from September or October to, you know,
maybe May, I guess.
Is that the coolest time?
A
Times of the year, yes.
And it's more guests that come during that
period of time?
A
Yes.
And is there more staff brought on during that
period of time?

A
Yes.
You saw that happen every year that you were
there?
A
Every year.
And in the summer, it's relatively dead because
it's so hot?
A
Basically, it closed during the summer. That's
when we would kind of work on everything and then make
sure everything is up to snuff for the next year, you
know.
Do you remember what capacity Virginia was hired
to work in, what her job title was, for example?
A
I don't know. I would have lunch with Virginia.
That's about as much as I know about what she did. I was
busy all the time.
I understand.
A
I didn't have time to go see what she was doing.
I didn't really talk to Angela about what she had to do.
I think that was her name, Angela. But it's kind of the
name that sticks out.
We'll just use Angela.
A
we'll use that as the name.
But we know it may not be Angela.
A
It may not be.
Just because we have to call her something,

A
Where did I learn that?
Uh-huh.
A
I think Virginia had told me that there was a
lady in the spa area named Ms. Maxwell. I don't know her.
I couldn't tell you what she looked like.
But just she said Ms. Maxwell said she can get
me a job with Jeffrey Epstein who is a friend of Donald
Trump, so I figured, well, he was a good guy or whatever,
you know, and that she was going to learn massage therapy.
When did Virginia tell you this?
Oh, I can't tell you what date and time but I
don't remember.
I understand.
Did she tell you this while she was working at
Mar-a-Lago?
A
Yes. I mean, after she had been there for a
little bit, you know, and then she told me, yes, that she
could possibly get this other job.
Okay.
A
You know.
So she worked at Mar-a-Lago for a few months?
MR. EDWARDS: Form.
THE WITNESS: I have no idea.
I don't know
how long she worked there. I don't remember.

A
Uh-huh. Yes. It's not to me. It's up to her.
I think that's the way I told her, you know.
Did you ever meet Jeffrey Epstein?
A
Once.
When was that?
A
I dropped Virginia off at the house once and he
came out and I met him and seemed just fine to me. I
mean, you can't tell people by looking at them.
I mean, I know now from, you know, what I've
read that he's not a good guy. But you can't tell. You
know, you don't even know your neighbors sometimes, you
know.
Do you remember about when you dropped Virginia
off at his house that you met him?
A
What do you mean?
Was it about the same time Virginia started
working with him?
Yeah.
Was it later?
A
I think it was about the time she started.
Because I wanted to see where she was at, you know. And
it was just a mansion down the street from, you know,
Mar-a-Lago. So I didn't think twice about it.
I didn't
think nothing of it. He came out. He was very cordial,
very nice.

Do you remember any part of your conversation
with him?
A
No. It was just that, you know how a parent has
to meet - you know, if my daughter is going to work
somewhere, I just want to meet the guy and see what was
going on, you know. But I don't remember any
conversation, you know.
I just remember meeting him and that was it and
she walked into the house and --
All right. So you recall Mr. Epstein coming
outside of his home and greeting you?
Yes.
Were you invited into his home?
No.
Did you ever go inside of his home?
A
No.
Other than that one time you dropped her off
there, do you ever remember going to that home?
A
No. I couldn't tell you where it was at.
Okay. Did you meet anyone else while you were
there at the home?
A
No.
Did you have a conversation with anyone else?
A
No.
Did you every call Virginia at that home?

All right. When she came home at night from
working with Mr. Epstein, did she look distressed to you
in any way?
A
Not that I remember.
Okay. Did she report any complaints about her
job with Mr. Epstein?
A
Not to me.
Okay. Did she report them to anyone else who
then reported them to you?
No.
Your wife, for example?
A
I have no idea. Like I said, if she did tell my
wife, I never heard about it.
Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell?

Not that I remember ever meeting her.

No.

EMPLOYEE ATTENDANCE AND TARDINESS
Your schedule is developed after considering the Club's
needs and flow of business.
Your adherence to the schedule and
flexibility concerning any necessary changes will help ensure our
Club's success.
Each employee is required to work the hours normally
scheduled for his or her
assigned position.
Employee's work schedules will be those hours authorized by
their Supervisor to meet operaional requirements.
If you are unable to report to work for any reason, you must
notify your supervisor no later than Three (3) hours prior to
your scheduled reporting time, stating your reason for lateness
or absence,
and when you expect to arrive at work. Check with
your supervisor to see if additional notice time is required.
In the event your supervisor is not available, you are to contact
SECURITY Ext.212 or the Human Resources Manager. |
You must call
Upon the third consecutive day of
absence, a Health Care Provider's note will be required of the
employee before returning to work. An employee who is absent for
three consecutive days without proper notice to the Club may be
considered to have voluntarily resigned his or her position with
the Club.
Failure to adhere to employee attendance policies results in
time consuming arrangements and costly replacements and may lead
to disciplinary action.
Tardiness places an unfair burden upon your supervisors and
co-workers. All efforts
should be made to be at work according
to schedule. Your supervisor is to be contacted if it is
for you to be late to work.
Continued tardiness will
result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page271 of 648
As a result of the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act
("Act"), the Club provides an added benefit to each employee.
Each employee will have up to 12 weeks of unpaid family leave
during a "rolling" 12-month period month period for: (1) the
birth and care of a newborn child; (2) adoption or foster care of
a child; (3) to provide care to an employee's spouse, son,
daughter or parent (or grandparent under certain circumstances)
who has a serious health condition; and (4) the employee's own
serious health condition which makes the employee unable to
perform his/her job functions. Upon an employee's return from
this leave, the Club guarantees that the employee will be placed
in the same or equivalent position, absent grievous and
substantial business reasons affecting the Club.
This leave may be used during the rolling 12-month period
even if the full 12 weeks have not been taken. Intermittent use
of this leave or a reduced leave schedule may be allowed only
where leave is taken for a sick family member, or for an
employee's own serious health condition, when
medically
necessary. If you are not eligible for the 12 weeks unpaid
leave, you may still be eligible to take-an unpaid leave of
absence for medical reasons or a personal leave of absence at the
discretion of the Club.
As a result of the Act, it has been necessary to modify some
provisions of our policies on sick days, short term disability
and personal leaves of absence to comply with the Act.
The
information that follows is designed to address the great
majority of situations that arise in a regular or routine manner.
The
federal Family Leave Law, however,
is subject to on-going
review process and interpretation by the courts, therefore, the
statements made here can not possibly address every contingency
that may arise in interpreting this new and broad Law.
For these
reasons, special situations will be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis.
Set forth below is the Club policy with regard to medical
and personal leaves of absence, including provisions of Act.
If you have any questions, please contact the Human
Resources Manager who will be glad to answer your questions.

a basis for fair and equitable treatment of each employee. In
addition, these guidelines serve as the basis for a fair
relationship between the employee and the Club. It is necessary
that these guidelines be applied consistently to each employee
regardless of location, department or manager. Then, and only
then, can the Club establish the confidence that each employee
will be treated consistently according to the administrative and
operational guidelines.
It is the responsibility of each
officer, manager, supervisor and employee to contribute fully
toward the achievement of this objective.
B. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

AIDS POLICY
The Club recognizes that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS), its related conditions
such as AIDS Related Complex
(ARC), and persons with seropositive test results pose
significant and delicate issues for employees in the workplace.
Accordingly, we have established the following guidelines
for handling employee issues that arise when an employee is
affected by this disease.
(1) The Club is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy
work environment for all employees.
(2) Consistent with this commitment, the Club will treat
AIDS the same as other illnesses in terms of all our employee
policies and benefits, such as group health and disability
benefits.
(3) Based on the overwhelming preponderance of available
medical and scientific opinion, including statements from the
U.S. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, there is
no evidence that the AIDS virus is casually transmitted in
ordinary social or occupational settings or conditions.
Therefore, subject to changes in available medical information,
it is the policy of the Club that employees with AIDS or any of
its related conditions may continue to work and the Club will
provide them with reasonable accommodation as long as they are
medically able to perform the duties of their position.
(4) Employees who are affected by AIDS or any other
life-threatening illness will be treated with compassion and
understanding in dealing with their personal crises.
Co-workers
will be expected to not refuse to work or withhold their services
for fear of contracting AIDS by working with an AIDS affected
person,
and to not harass or otherwise discriminate against an
AIDS-affected employee.
(5) Recognizing the need for all employees to be able to be
accurately informed about AIDS, upon
request, the Club will make
about this disease,
how best to contain it from spreading.
Employees affected by
AIDS or any of its related conditions
or concerned about AIDS are
encouraged to contact Human Resources Manager to discuss their
concerns and to obtain additional information.
(6) The Club will treat all medical information obtained
from
employees with AIDS or any of its
related conditions
confidentially as required by law.
The Club reserves the right to change this policy or make
appropriate revisions, additions, amendments or corrections.
We
will notify you of any substantive changes.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY
Our Club strives to provide a safe work environment and
encourages personal health. In regard to this,
the Club
considers the abuse of drugs or alcohol on the job to be an
unsafe and counterproductive work practice.
Quite simply, our
goal is to maintain a work environment that is free from the
effects of alcohol and drug abuse.
While the Club has no intention of intruding into the
private lives of its employees, the Club does expect employees to
report for work in condition to perform their duties.
It is,
therefore, Club policy that an employee found with the presence
of alcohol or illegal drugs in his/her system, in possession of,
using,
selling, trading, or offering for sale illegal drugs or
alcohol during working hours, may be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including discharge.
(Club sponsored activities
which may include the service of alcoholic beverages are not
included in this provision.)
Substance Abuse includes possession, use, purchase or sale
oi drugs or alcohol on Club premises. It also includes reporting
to work under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Prescription
drugs-prescribed by the employee's physician may be taken during
work hours.
The employee should notify the Supervisor if the use
of-properly prescribed prescription drugs will affect the
employee's work performance. Abuse of prescription drugs will
not be tolerated.
An employee reporting for work visibly impaired is unable to
properly perform required duties and will not be allowed to work.

DRUG /ALCOHOL USE AND TESTING
The Mar-a-Lago Club recognizes that employee drug abuse
interferes with the Club's level of production, as well as its
competitive position in the marketplace, and can result in costs,
delays,
and
tragedies associated with work-related accidents. As
a condition to employment or continued employment, you must
refrain from reporting to work or working with the presence of
drugs or alcohol in your body.
To address the problem of drug/alcohol abuse and to comply with
Florida's Workers' Compensation Drug-Free Workplace Act (the Act)
The Mar-a-Lago Club adopts the policies and procedures detailed
below.
This policy will be administered in accordance with all
relevant laws (state and local), including the ADA, the Florida
Civil Rights Act, the Workers' Compensation Act, and in a non-
discriminatory fashion.
To protect the health, safety,
and welfare of all Mar-a-Lago Club
employees, it is the Club's policy that the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of controlled
substance on
any Club property is absolutely prohibited.
Controlled substances include,
but are not limited to,
amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, heroin, morphine, PCP,
marijuana, hashish, and any other controlled substance listed in
Schedules
I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substance
Act, 21 U.S.C. § 812 or in the Florida Statute on controlled
substances, except for medication prescribed by the employee's
physician.
You are also prohibited from drinking alcohol during the business
day.
You are also prohibited from bringing alcoholic beverages
onto the Club premises.
Special care shall be taken during
Company-sponsored social events for employees. In these cases,
employees and guests below the legal age will not be allowed to
drink alcoholic beverages.
The amount of time alcohol is served
will be limited as well as the quantity of the alcohol.
If
necessary, transportation will be arranged for someone if his or
her driving ability seems to be impaired.
The Mar-a-Lago Club will test for the presence of drugs under the
following circumstances:
1) pre-employment testing, 2)
reasonable suspicion testing (including post-accident incidents),
and 3) follow-up testing.
Such testing will be done in
accordance with the worker's Compensation Drug Testing Program,
which policy had been given to all employees or can be obtained
from the Human Resources Manager.
Refusal to submit to the test
or having a confirmed, positive test result will result in
immediate discipline,
including termination. Any questions about
this policy should be referred to the Human
Resources Manager.

IF YOU LEAVE EMPLOYMENT
RESIGNATION POLICY
When an employee decides to leave for any reason, his/her
supervisor and the Human Resources Manager would like the
opportunity to discuss the resiqnation before final action is
taken. The Mar-a-Lago Club often finds during such a
conversation that another alternative may be better. If,
however, after full consideration the employee decides to leave,
it is expected that the employee will provide the Club with a
written two-week advance notice period (bear in mind that
vacation days or personal days may not be included in the two-
week notice period).
Generally, in order to qualify for payment
of earned unused vacation, the employee must work throughout the
notice period.
If, as sometimes hapens, the employee s
supervisor believes it advisable for the employee to leave prior
to the end of
the employee's two-weeks notice, the employee may
be paid for the remainder of that period.
Note: You are not
entitled to be paid for any unused, accrued sick time.
DISMISSALS
Every Mar-a-Lago employee has the status of "employee-at-will",
meaning that no one has a contractual right, express or implied,
to remain in The Mar-a-Lago Club's employ.
The Club may
terminate an employee's employment, or an employee may terminate
his/her employment, with or without cause, and with or without
notice, at any time. No supervisor or other representative of
the Club (except the owner) has the authority to enter into any
agreement for employment for any specified period of time, or to
make any agreement contrary to the above.

Ms. Roberts (jenna),
It is obvious that you have a number of personal issues going on that need your
immediate attention and keep you from being able to focus on and perform the
material duties of your job here at Courtyard Animal Hospital.
In the short time you have been employed here, you have missed'multiple days,
arrived late, called in sick multiple times. The reasoning you have given has shown
that you are "distracted" at minimum. Between your "engine falling out of your car,
your axle breaking off which your boyfriend 'repaired it roadside' and your landlord
tossing all your furniture and clothing out in the front yard and setting it on fire", it
is clear that you have more pressing issues in your life to focus on. You have been
unable to perform to an acceptable standard within our company.
It is because of your inability to perform your duties here, be in attendance when
scheduled and focus on the job requirements that we are forced to terminate your
employment.

AUSTRICH STATED THAT HIS
EX-FIANCE VIRGINIA ROBERTS, WHO ALSO RESIDES AT THE ABOVE LISTED

UNKNOWN SUSPECT ANTHONY DIDN'T GET ALONG.
THE SUSPECT THEN BECAME
VERBALLY ABUSIVE TO AUSTRICH.
AUSTRICH THEN TOLD ANTHONY TO LEAVE
THE APARTMENT. ANTHONY THEN BECAME AGITATED AND AGAIN AUSTRICH TOLD
HIM TO LEAVE. AUSTRICH'S FRIEND JOHN PERKINS WAS PRESENT DURING THE
ALTERCATION AND STATED IN A SWORN WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT HE ALSO TOLD
ANTHONY TO LEAVE THE APARTMENT. PERKINS WAS IN FEAR THAT AUSTRICH
AND ANTHONY WERE GOING TO FIGHT. ANTHONY FINALLY LEFT THE
APARTMENT. AUSTRICH GOT THE APARTMENT DOOR CLOSED ANTHONY THEN
REOPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AUSTRICH'S
PERMISSION, AND PUNCHED AUSTRICH ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE WITH A
CLOSED FIST CAUSING MINOR SWELLING AND A LARGE RED MARK. PERKINS
THEN WENT TO THE TELEPHONE AND CALLED POLICE. ANTHONY OBSERVED
PERKINS ON THE TELEPHONE AND FLED THE SCENE PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL.
AUSTRICH ALSO PROVIDED ME WITH A SWORN WRITTEN STATEMENT.
I
ASKED AUSTRICH IF HE NEEDED MEDICAL TREATMENT?
AUSTRICH VERBALLY
STATED THAT HE DID NOT NEED ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT.

****************AMENDED PROBABLE CAUSE ******************
On 04-13 -00, I received from Evidence Custodian Fanelli, one pill inside a purple pill case seized from the
search warrant executed on 11-19-99 on Anthony Figueroa residence. The purpose of this was to test this one
pill for the presence of MDMA, using a heroin test kit. The pill tested positive for the presence of MDMA by
turning the color black. It should be noted that on 11-19-1999, after Anthony Figueroa was read his Miranda
rights, he was interviewed and admitted that the pill inside the purple case was indeed ecstasy or MDMA.
This pill has a "Batman" symbol imprinted on it. This pill was placed back into evidence. Based on this
information, I believe probable cause now exists for the poss. of a controlled substance (MDMA). Note, all
suspect marijuana seized at
. tested positive for narcotic content.
This amended probable cause was sent to S/A Debra Colton for charge purposes. Nothing further.

A. Yes.

provided by your attorney a -- what has been
5
represented to be a copy, a direct copy of that
logbook.
And I'm going to mark this as

MR. REINHART: It is not a copy of the
18
entire book. It is the time period that was

covered by the subpoena. I just want to make
clear the book covers the time period outside
21
the subpoena.
22
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. I will let him
23
clarify that, of
course, too.

THE WITNESS: Yes. It is logbook. It is
not 40 years, but it is my logbook.

BY MR. EDWARDS:
Okay.
You can keep this -- that down
there
- -
A.
Okay.
-- so we can keep track of the exhibits.
A.
Okay.
So does the copy that you just went
through, is that an exact copy of the original
logbook from the November 1995 date through, it
looks like, September 2013? That period of time?
A.
Yes
Q.
Okay.
And what is this book?
What do you
call the book?
A.
It is called the
standard pilot master
log.
All right. And who made the various
entries in the book?
A.
I did.
l.
When did you make --
MR.
PAGLIUCA: Brad, can you hang on for

MR. EDWARDS: Sure.
MR. PAGLIUCA: You said September 2013, I

says. It could have been possibly a later date.
Most likely,
fairly close to that date.
Okay.
How did you make sure that the log
entries
that you were creating were accurate?
A.
Well, people get on the airplane and I see
who the people are, and I put them down there.
Okay.
So you are making the notation at
or around the time that you are making this
observation -- the observations?
A.
Correct.
Q.
And you are recording the data accurately
in your logbook?
A.
As accurately as I can.
Okay.
A.
Yes.
Can we just look at the first page of the
exhibit?
A.
Uh-huh.
And if you could walk
me through, let's
just take
the first line.
A.
Uh-huh.

In

A.
Correct.
And it says, "NOV '95."

Yes
Q. Okay. .
And the first line under that in
the date column
says 17.
Is that November 17th,
1995?
A.
Yes.
Is that a notation that you would have
9 made on November 17th, 1995?
A.
Yes.
Q. And the next column over under "aircraft
make and model," there is a number there. What is
that number?
A.
That's the model of aircraft we're flying.
It's a G-1159B.
It is Gulfstream, II-B aircraft.
Okay.
And then the next column over,
aircraft identification mark?
A.
It is the registration number of
the
aircraft.
Q.
And what is the
registration number?
What
does that mean?
A.
The number that is on the side of every
aircraft to
identify what
country it is from and
what particular
airplane it is in that country.
The
N means
United States.

And is that number unique to the aircraft?
A.
Yes
So there is no other aircraft at the same
time bearing
the identification number
in N908JE?
A.
That's correct.
Who picks the identification number?
I
understand N means United States.
A. Right.
Who picks the 908JE?
A. It depends -- some aircraft, I mean, when
you get them, they already have the number on there,
and so that would be one way. Sometimes the
manufacturer puts
them on there.
You can also
request a certain number,
i f
you
so chose to do so.
Okay.
The particular air -- these
particular logs
were produced in a -- as a
consequence of a subpoena issued in the case of
Virginia Roberts Giuffre versus Ghislaine Maxwell.

Yes.

years.
The period of time -- or that is evidenced
by this logbook is '95 through 2013.
Why was it that period of time that was
chosen?
A .
Because that is what the subpoena
requested.
Okay.
Is that when you started flying for
Jeffrey Epstein?
A.
NO.
When did you start flying for Jeffrey
Epstein?
A.
July of 1991.
Okay.
Do you have available today the
entries going back as far as July 1991?
A.
I don't know. I have to look and see.
Okay.
A.
No.
Because this is from 7/28 of '94.
Okay.

July 28th, 1994?

a Jeffrey Epstein owned or controlled airplane?
A.
It
was -- let me think.
This was 908 Juliet, Echo -- I believe it
was owned by Hyperion Air, Inc., I believe.
e.
And is Hyperion Air, to your
understanding, a company associated with Jeffrey
Epstein?
A.
As far as I know. I mean, I would assume
SO,
but
- -
l.
Was Jeffrey Epstein your primary
passenger
--
A.
Yes.
e.
A.
-- on that airplane?
Yes.
e.
And who was the individual that gave you
direction
as
to what passengers
to let on and off
the airplane and where to fly, et cetera?
A.
Well, Jeffrey was usually -- I mean,
almost
always on the airplane, unless we were going
to
maintenance.
And so when he got there, he would
have the
people with him.
Okay.
So going back to the aircraft
identification
mark, 908JE, does the JE signify the
initials of Jeffrey Epstein?

DAVID RODGERS
A.
I would assume so.
Okay.
A.
But technically they are actually the
phonetic letters that we use. But technically it is
Juliet echo;
it is not Jeffrey Epstein. As far as
radio phraseology, we don't answer Jeffrey Epstein;
we answer Juliet.
Q.
Okay. But the JE doesn't signify some
jurisdictional code?
A. NO.
O. It is -- it is chosen by the owner of the
aircraft?
A.
Right. Right.
l. So as his pilot and as Jeffrey Epstein
being the main passenger, you have presumed that JE
signifies his initials?
A.
I would assume so.
In fact, we will get to it later down the
road, but
the
--the other plane also bears the
ending
initials JE; is that right?
A.
Yes.
And this N number that's on this airplane
was eventually switched to another airplane.
Q.
To
the Boeing?

Okay.
So if we go back to this first entry, the
next column
says, "From
CMH. "
A.
Yes.
e.
And what is that?
A.
Columbus, ohio.
l.
That is an airport code?
A.
Airport identifier.
And, again, that airport code is unique to
a particular airport?
A.
Correct.
The next is
"TO PBI"?
A.
Yes.
Where is that?
A.
West Palm Beach.
l. And flight number?
The next column says
"Miles Flown."
A.
Right.
That is not
something that you log.
A.
I don't.
You kept pretty meticulous logs.
So the next column is flight 10g-- or
flight number?

at
this point in
time.
Q.
Yeah.
It shows
up on the next page.
We
will
get there.
A.
Does it?
Okay.
So then, yes, the answer is, yeah, we
still had the airplane. But we wouldn't have used
that.
So is there any way of telling how Jeffrey
Epstein,
Ghislaine Maxwell, Adam
Perry Lang, and
Virginia were in the Virgin Islands on that, from
December 14th, 2000 --
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to foundation.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
-- based on your knowledge or your logs or
anything else?
A.
No, I wouldn't have any way of knowing.
Okay.
A.
Because the next flight that they are on
was like this Palm Beach one, January 16th. So I
wouldn't have any idea.
Q.
Okay.
To your knowledge, did Jeffrey
Epstein ever
fly commercially?

A .
He probably has. Back then at this time,
I'm going to say probably not. But I know that he
has flown commercially. But usually that would be
like going
to Europe, maybe.
Okay.
January 16th through the 25th,
those flights, do you see that block that I'm
talking about?
A.
Yes.
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy
Tayler, and then at times Shelly Lewis, do you see
that?
A.
Yes, right.
Q.
The 25th it lands in Teterboro. And the
next day, on the 26th, leaves out of Teterboro with
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy Tayler,
and
Virginia Roberts. This time you wrote the whole
name.
A.
Right. Right.
So when you write the full name, does that
signify -- that's when
you may have learned her last
name?
A.

to New
Correct.
And do you know how she -- how she got up
Jersey or New

Some association, yes.
Do you know who flew the Gulfstream while
you were doing the simulator?

Well, it would have been Larry Visoski,
I'm not sure who the first officer was.
Q.

I met with victim Richard Figueroa, Jr., who told me that he allowed his brother, Anthony, to use his 1986 Mazda pick-up truck to
drive a friend home to Okeechobee Blyd. and Cherry Road at about 8pm, on 10/21/00. Richard told me that he has always been
very specific about the times and use he allows his brother to use the truck, to the extent that he has told Anthony that if the truck
Were not brought back in the allotted time, he would call the police and report the truck stolen. For this trip, Anthony told
Richard he would be back in 30 minutes. At about 10:15pm, Anthony called Richard to say that the truck had a flat tire, and that
he would be right home. Richard asked Anthony where he was and Anthony would not say. At about 12:22am, on 10/22/00,
Richard called the police department to report the truck stolen.
I explained the seriousness about reporting a vehicle stolen, to the extent that is covered on the stolen vehicle affidavit. Richard
filled-out this form and signed the same without any hesitation. Richard further stated that he had to be at work in the morning
and was concerned since he needed the vehicle to get there.

depriving the victim use of his vehicle.

When the victim arrived to reclaim his vehicle, he inspected the tires and believed that they were the original tires and could not
detect any evidence of a flat tire or use of a spare tire. He further wrote me another written statement, indicating to me that
Luckett never had permission to drive his truck.
Figueroa went to the County Jail and
went to the Juvenile Assessment Center.

e. Most of the events that we are going to
discuss today occurred, at least the investigation
that we're going to discuss today, occurred in 2005
and 2006.
So can you just tell us what your position
was with the Palm Beach Police Department at that
time?
A. I was a police detective.
e. And did you
investigate a person by the
name of Jeffrey Epstein?
A.
I did.
Q. All right.
What was your role in the investigation of
Jeffrey Epstein?
A.
I was the lead detective once the case was
turned over to me by Michelle Pagan.
Okay. And as the lead detective, did you
review all of the history of the investigation up to
the point it was turned
over to you?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

THE WITNESS:
Correct.

Just so that the record is clear, will you
just give a brief pause in case Mr. Pagliuca has an
objection?
A. All right.
So they can also capture your answer.
A.
Okay.
Q.
In reviewing the history of the case, did
you review prior police reports, police reports
prior to you becoming involved personally?
A. I did.

Okay. And I've handed you what is marked

"ever."
So not to my knowledge.
l. Certainly, nothing in Exhibit 1, Narrative
1 reflects that this individual ever met or talked
to or spoke to Ghislaine Maxwell, right?
A. Right. Not to my knowledge.
l. And, indeed, you would agree with me that
if this individual claimed that Ms. Maxwell had
something to do with the events listed in Narrative

today, do you know who the subjects of the four
counts that are referenced on the first page of

from the grand jury; it came from the State
Attorney's Office.

investigation. But it would have started under
Pagan.
Q.
Okay. Do you recall in what - well, how
was surveillance conducted, if you recall?
A. I didn't conduct it personally, no. That
would have been under plainclothes unit team. They
would have sent out a vehicle and recorded vehicles
coming and going and actual physical surveillance.
e.
So physical surveillance means eyes on the
property, correct?
A.
Right.
And eyes on the property by a police
officer, correct?
A.
Correct.
Q. And that police officer would be charged
with the obligation of recording the incomings and
outgoings of people to the property, correct?
A.
Correct.
Is there a log that's maintained during
surveillance?
A.
I'm not sure who -- if there was a log or
not. I know that they set up a vehicle with cameras
facing -- facing Epstein's residence.

they would videotape that person; is that correct?
A. Or they would just leave the video

And did you have the opportunity to
observe any of that video?
A.
I did observe a couple, but the person who
actually set it up would review it and then submit a
supplement to the report.

the surveillance led to the identification of
Ghislaine Maxwell as coming or leaving the house
during the time of surveillance, correct?

Defendant / Counterclaim Plaintiff.

AFFIDAVIT OF JUAN P. ALESSI
REGARDING KNOWLEDGE OF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ
A. Introduction
1. My name is Juan P. Alessi. I make this declaration voluntarily and without
compensation on personal knowledge concerning Alan Dershowitz and his visits at
my former employer Jeffrey Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida.
2. I worked for Mr. Epstein from January 1991 to December 2002 as a full-time
employee performing maintenance services and then also became the manager for the
home on 358 El Brillo Way in Palm Beach, Florida.
3. Since Mr. Epstein was investigated and arrested, I have spoken with police,
investigators, and attorneys concerning my time working for Mr. Epstein.
4. On September 8, 2009, I gave a deposition in the case captioned Jane Doe No. 2 v.
Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 08-CV-80119 in which I truthfully answered the questions
posed by the attorneys. I also gave a sworn statement on November 21, 2005 to

Case 1:15-CV-07433-RWS Document 435-3 Filed 09/15/16 Page 3 of 6
Detective Joseph Recarey of the Palm Beach P.D. during their investigation of Mr.
Epstein.
5. I have reviewed the statements that Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell attribute to me
in their papers in the cases against the Government and against Mr. Dershowitz.
Because I do not believe they accurately reflect the statements I previously made, I
submit this affidavit to have my statements accurately reflected and made clear on the
record.
B. Summary of My Knowledge of Massages at Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach Home
6. As I stated in my deposition, a massage was like a treat for all the guests at Mr.
Epstein's home. Mr. Epstein usually received his massages in his private suite, but
guests would also be given massages in their respective rooms or by the pool area.
7. There were between fifty (50) to one hundred (100) masseuses - mostly women but
also some men - who would come to give massages during this time. I provided
names of masseuses in my deposition.
8. As I stated in my deposition, I was unaware of any masseuses being under the age of
18. I believed that the females' age ranged from overage to maybe mid-forties. As I
stated in my deposition, I received as a gift a massage from a male masseuse at Mr.
Epstein's home in Palm Beach.
9. In my deposition, I was asked about cleaning up after massages. I stated that when I
cleaned Mr. Epstein's bedroom suite, which included the bathroom of Ms. Maxwell,
after massages, I would, on occasion, find vibrators and sex toys. I have specific
recollection of finding these items in the sink of Ms. Maxwell's bathroom. I did not
state or imply that vibrators or sex toys were found after massages in other rooms
used by guests because that was not the case. Guests having massages did not have

GM_01198


Case 18-2868, Document 278, 08/09/2019, 2628230, Page530 of 648
Case 1:15-CV-07433-RWS Document 435-3 Filed 09/15/16 Page 4 of 6
massages in Mr. Epstein's private bedroom suite. This area was private and off-limits
to guests, which I explained to the lawyers during my deposition. As I said in my
deposition, massage tables were located in almost every room, including guest rooms
and by the pool. I never found, and never heard anyone in the house finding, a
vibrator or a sex toy in the same room where any guest, including Alan Dershowitz,
had a massage.
10. The following statement made by Virginia Roberts's attorneys in a filing on January
21, 2015 is not accurate and is a misrepresentation of what I said in my deposition:
"The private, upstairs room where Dershowitz got his "massages' was one that
contained a lot of vibrators - Maxwell had 'a laundry basket... full of those toys' in
that room."
C. Summary of My Interaction with Alan M. Dershowitz
11. During the approximate thirteen years I worked for Mr. Epstein, I believe I saw Mr.
Dershowitz visit Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach home approximately four or five times a
year. I recall driving him to the airport on multiple occasions.
12. At the time, I understood that Mr. Dershowitz was a famous lawyer. His visits to the
house would typically involve a group of intellectuals or business men in social, but
professional type gatherings.
13. I can recall that Mr. Dershowitz had a massage on at least one occasion during a visit
to Mr. Epstein's home in Palm Beach (although I cannot recall that Mr. Dershowitz
received a massage on more than one occasion). I do not recall Mr. Dershowitz being
massaged by anyone who I thought was less than 18 years old. I have no reason to
doubt Mr. Dershowitz's statement that this massage was done by a woman named
Olga who was in her forties. In fact, I do remember a masseuse named Olga that

Case 1:15-CV-07433-RWS Document 435-3 Filed 09/15/16 Page 5 of 6
lived in Palm Beach, though I do not know her last name. As I have said, I never saw
Mr. Dershowitz around young girls. I have also explained that there were masseuses,
both male and female, that were in their mid-forties.
14. I never saw Mr. Dershowitz do anything improper or be present while anyone else
was being improper.
15. Before asking me about Jeffrey Epstein speaking to celebrities at the house, the
attorney for "Jane Doe 102" asked me about Jean Luc Brunel, Mark Epstein, Daniel
Estes, Matt Groening, and Leslie Wexner. I then listed Senator Mitchell, Prince
Andrew, Princess Sarah Ferguson, Miss Yugoslavia, Miss Germany, Alan
Dershowitz, Princess Diana's secretary with her children, Mr. Trump, Mr. Robert
Kennedy, Jr., Frederik Fekkai, and a couple Noble prize winners as celebrities that I
had seen while working for Mr. Epstein. I also mentioned a reunion of Nobel prize
winners that was held at the house, and that I met President Clinton at Mr. Epstein's
plane the last month that I was working for Mr. Epstein.
C. Summary of My Interaction with Virginia Roberts
16. The first time I saw Virginia Roberts was at Mar-a-Lago where I believed she
worked in the spa. I only recall seeing Virginia Roberts come to Mr. Epstein's house
during the last year that I worked for Mr. Epstein. During this time, I believe she
visited Mr. Epstein's home in Palm Beach two or three times a week.
17. 1 never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. Epstein's house. I was
shown a photo of Virginia Roberts during my deposition, and I recognized the woman
in the photo as Virginia Roberts.
18. As I stated in my deposition, I am not sure whether Virginia Roberts came to the
house when Prince Andrew was there.

Case 1:15-CV-07433-RWS Document 435-3 Filed 09/15/16 Page 6 of 6
19. I was never asked by any attorneys if Virginia Roberts came to the house when Mr.
Dershowitz was there. If I had been asked, I would have answered that I never saw
Virginia Roberts at the house when Mr. Dershowitz was there.
20. The following statement made by Virginia Roberts's attorneys and their own attorney
in a filing on December 4, 2015 is not accurate and is a misrepresentation of what I
said in my deposition: "Alessi was able to identify a photograph of Ms. Giuffre as
someone who was at the mansion as the same time as Dershowitz."
21. As far as I can recall, since I gave my deposition in 2009, I have never been asked by
Brad Edwards or Paul Cassell about my knowledge regarding Virginia Roberts or
Alan Dershowitz or about my 2009 deposition testimony.
I understand that I am swearing or affirming under oath to the truthfulness of the
claims made in this affidavit and that the punishment for knowingly making a false
statement includes fines and/or imprisonment.

Did it feel good to be close to the fire
because it was cold out or was it a summertime bonfire?

I believe I had just bought my house in
Titusville, Florida.
I bought my house in, I think, I
either got it October or November of 2013. It would have
been around probably November.

Why did you decide to keep the photos?
They're evidence.

The Billionaire's Playboy Club
By Virginia Roberts
To my true love Robbie who believes in me every step of the way and
to all of my children, you are all my very inspirations!
Chapter1
Every single person in this shared world together has a unique story of
his or her own to tell, this one is mine.
It was coming up to my third night camping out at Miami Beach in the
summer of 1997. 1 was thirteen years old and hiding from a world full of
hurt. Sitting on the shoreline for hours watching the sunset fall deeper
into the horizon, my eyes were glazed over with tears, not from being
wind-whipped by the rough sea breeze, but from reflecting on the abuse I
encountered as a young girl and how everyone in my life who was
supposed to be there for me had now turned their backs on me in
abandonment. My fears crept up and the excitement of escaping all of
them faded now realizing how alone I really was now, and for the hunger
that was paining my belly. At this point, with nowhere to go and only
time to waste, I wiped the tears from my eyes and set out to find an
empathetic person that I could manage to get dinner money from. If not,
it wouldn't have been the first time I had gone hungry for the night. I
walked to the nearest bus stop and asked a handful of people for any
spare change, none of whom that could help me. Sitting down on a
nearby curb disappointed in grief of my current state, I put my head into
my knees and began to sob.
Out of nowhere, it seemed, a black stretch limousine turned the corner
and stopped in front of the curb where I had been hopelessly lost. The
back door opened to reveal a heavy weight and balding, old man with a
big cheesy smile. Neatly dressed in black trousers and a collared shirt, he
was sitting next to a striking young, blonde girl, drop dead beautiful and
dressed in a foxy red mini dress she looked like a model just stepping off
Their smiles greeted me warmly and he kindly asked, "What is such a
sweet little girl like you doing sitting alone on the street looking so
upset?" Shocked from this strangers concern I was hesitant in telling him
around heRe and rely decide. Hopil at most, woad get same on frey
offered fie to come eti is car si played a cal some more. That d
should've been my first queue to get out of there quick but with no where
to go, and so naïve I didn't realize how much worse it could get. Setting
foot into that limo, I made my first entrance into a world that would
entrap me for many years to come.
He introduced himself immediately as Ron Eppinger, a businessman
and owner of a successful modeling agency, called "Perfect 10"
Flaunting his oozing wealth by introducing one of his many girlfriends,
the beauty next to him was Yana, a supposed model from the Czech
Republic who looked like she could be in her early twenties with the
heavy load of makeup she was wearing, but really was only in her late
teens. She kissed me on both cheeks and politely said "Hello" in a thick
Czech accent, making me feel a little more at ease. Convinced it couldn't
be that bad there was another girl in the car, right? I couldn't be more
What he didn't tell me to begin with was that his modeling agency was
only posing for an undercover trade. By the time I found out I thought it
was too late to run. His business was really an illegal immigrant
trafficking ring of young women mostly consisting of underage girls that
he was using as escorts to make him uber rich. Only available to a
selective clientele costing them anywhere from $1000.00 and over per
hour of erotic entertainment, the girls were trained to fulfill every sexual
desire asked of them, no matter how bizarre the requests might be. The
high paid escorts, for Ron's super rich clientele, such as Yana and many
other charismatic beauties would only benefit a fraction of their earnings
for themselves, Ron reaping in the majority of the financial rewards and
being they were all illegal immigrants they were further trapped by his
I proceeded to introduce myself, besides what he had found out about
me on the curbside. Telling him my name and a little about how I ended
up on the streets explaining that I could take care of myself and didn't
need my family or anyone to look after me anymore. Looking back later
in life I can now admit I was in a terrible state, but being such a
headstrong teenager, I refused to give in. He asked my age and I told him
I was sixteen at first. He coyly replied, "Are you sure? I think you could
be telling me a fib? How old are you... really? I wont be mad" Being a
terrible liar, I knew had been caught out and couldn't deny it any further.
I told him the truth and he chuckled then paused and answered in a very
serious tone " As long as you never lie to me again I will take you in"

of life was just mind blowing to even comprehend at first. With such a
new outlook of the world to try and grasp at my young age I was listening
to every word spoken to me with such attentiveness, I was going to try
and model what I was observing from the girls. I justified their way of
thinking in my head for now, thinking if all these girls seem happy
enough, why couldn't I try to be, it was this or the streets for me.
Ron came back for me not long after our conversation got out of hand
and took me to a bathroom down the hall. He opened the tap and filled a
small plastic cup with water and handed me two small blue oval pills.
Telling me to take them both as they would help me to relax a little bit
more. I swallowed the pills just following his orders. I put the cup on the
counter top and turned back around to face him. Backing me up against
the wall and now cornered by this large man I felt his slithering hands
began to creep under my shirt, writhing my skin. I closed my eyes tightly
and turned my head away from him, hoping he would take my actions as
a sign of being extremely uncomfortable but that wouldn't bother him at
all. He was half enjoying my reaction from the smug look on his face,
and persisted through it.
Continuing to undress my clothes he said he wanted to look me over
and clean me up. It was so humiliating having to expose myself to this
ageing man and now I knew he was going to end up with his hands and
whatever else all over me. All too soon I hated to be right, as I stood
naked before his widened eyes, he told me "you're a hairy bugger I'll
have to shave you right up young lady", and I didn't know he wasn't just
talking about my legs. Standing with my legs wide apart while this man
coaxed me through the entire ordeal of shaving, his hands made me feel
so dirty. "Have I lost my mind?" I thought to myself but I had to play
nice until I had an opportunity to get away, this was not as fun as the girls
made it out to be after all, this was utterly disgusting. I had no idea what
was going to happen next with this guy, and due to whatever
pharmaceuticals he gave me, I still don't know to this day.
Waking up the next morning my head was pounding in an agonizing
thumping pain and I was so thirsty. The satin sheets thankfully covered
my body, which was still nude from the night before, and I could hear
hushed voices standing over the bed where I was pretending to still be
asleep. Listening in on their conversation I kept my eyes shut. I knew
Ron's voice from two of the men but not recognizing the other guys I just
stayed quiet hoping they'd soon leave. Ron was telling the other man
what atrocities he got up to the night before with me and I heard him say,
"Doesn't she even look like an angel the way she sleeps? She's my own
little angel!" He exclaimed proudly. I opened my eyes and rolled over to
face them both having to wrap the sheets over my body, really not
knowing what to say except "Good-morning" in a blushful tone. Ron
introduced me to his business partner and told to go get dressed. He had
my whole day planned out for me already. Booked into get my hair
colored, a much lighter tint of blonde, and afterwards a day of shopping
with the girls I was becoming exactly what he wanted me too, a carbon
copy of the teenage Barbie... only I wasn't plastic and came with many
Days turned into weeks, being a servant to the sexual desires of this
distorted pervert. I dreamt of escaping but where would I go and how
would I get away from Ron with him controlling my every second of my
day. Separating myself from the other girls being so uncomfortable with
enduring the everyday occurrences I was longing for the solitude of the
beach again. They were training me up to be an escort prodigy or
something like it. Outrageous orgies were conducted as my lessons with
the girls teaching me all of their tricks in the game, it was all for the sake
of men's perverted fantasies, they didn't get anything from being sexually
exploited and molesting each other, except getting paid for it. Everything
from oral sex too penetration with toys, I was expected to not only to join
in but even perform ludicrous acts of hedonism.
I was Thirteen years old and had never heard the terminology of these
sexual acts before, and definitely shouldn't have been learning them first
hand. Thrown into a world of chaos, I didn't know what to do except be
as compliant as possible, even when asked to do the most degrading
tasks. The excitement of the lifestyle he offered quickly diminished once
T had to pay so dearly for it. The girls that subdued to this lifestyle and
enjoyed it definitely put on a good act, but no little girl with hopes and
dreams of their untainted future, turns to her mother and say's "one day I
dream of being a prostitute, passed around from man to man, only to
grow older regretting so much of my life" It was all a part of an illusion
that Ron painted for us that made it seem so alluring in the first place.
Spending my days with Ron, he took advantage at every chance given.
Even in his convertible with the top down I would be forced to go topless
while he drove around, when I asked him why one day, it was supposedly
so I could maintain an even suntan, but I knew it was his way of showing
off his treasures. It was a far cry from the simple country life I had been
raised in. Wearing designer miniskirts and tops that always revealed too
much, of course due to Ron and the girls determining everything I wore,
ae, or beds, and cauld as ind oas passala hase chinins, shoppingere
expected to become party animals and greet Ron's clientele with the
upmost flirtatious attention and doting as possible. Then whether we were
out for dinner, at a party, or at a club, the men would choose his girl and
take her home. Every girl had a different price and so did the charges
depending on the various clienteles but Ron always kept me for himself.

sympathy and gave him my pity, believing this man had a heart. His next
proposal was eerie, he said," If you wanted, I can be your new Daddy.
Someone to take care of you and you'll be my new baby forever" he
stroked my hair such as a caring parent would comfort a scared child. A
part of me wanted to accept his words and believe he really could feel
that way, and then I also considered how hard it was living on the streets.
In the end I convinced myself this would be the lesser of two evils.
The car stopped at a plaza on the water, surrounded by little boutique
shops, restaurants, and little stalls with items for sale like sunglasses and
costume jewelry. I didn't know what to say or do or how to act, it all
happened so fast I just went along with everything he said, for now.
We went to a take out restaurant and ate on the waterside, and
afterwards he took me to G.A.P Kids co. to dress me in his idea of proper
attire, tiny cutoff shorts revealing the cusp of my buttocks and some shirts
that barely fit, even the sales assistant was shocked at what she thought
was my Grandfathers choice in clothing. I couldn't even believe it myself
only an hour ago I was begging for money living on the streets and now I
was dining alfresco and shopping at name brand outlets. We then hit a
couple of more specialty stores afterwards. He said he had to buy me a
few more necessities to start with. Lacy G-strings and what looked to me
like lingerie pieces I had only seen grown women wearing in magazine
ad's or movies was now a part of my wardrobe, in my mind it was a big
step up from being a little girl any longer.
The driver took us back to Ron's grand apartment overlooking the isle
of Key Biscayne and a large bridge leading into a Miami Harbor.
Entering his residence, I was blown away by the spectacular view, rich
décor, and white marble floors that were so glossy it looked as if I was
stepping on glass. He took my shopping bags to a large room at the back
of the apartment and put them into a small closet. The room was
considerably large with glass exterior walls that maximized the potential
of the panorama landscape soaking in the seascape of Miami. In the room
was a gigantic round bed raised off the floor by three steps and mirrors on
the ceiling. It looked like a honeymoon suite out of a raunchy hotel. He
then exclaimed, "This is my room here and you will be sharing it with
me" When I asked him where I would sleep he then sickly replied "With
mobily here ever of cou sap ly i noon se for argument i pretended
my head to run.
Next I was taken down a long hall at the other end of the apartment to
meet five more exotic beauties. Three girls were in their late teens and the
other two in were in their early twenties. All of them were from the
Czech, here under false passports provided by Ron and his contacts. Yana
held my hand while introducing me to the group of zirls as "Baby" a Det
name she came up with for me, being I was the youngest one among them
or ever to be brought in by Ron for that matter. It became my new
identity not even worrying to mention my real name to anyone anymore.
My identity was no longer important to myself, I wanted to become
someone new and "Baby" is who I was.
A shocking first impression, the girls were completely nude revealing
their voluptuous young bodies with such a careless ease and others were
in just a G-string, similar to the one's Ron had bought me earlier. They
were all stunning girls and full of life. Charismatic and beautiful, they
were the girls who should be on the front of billboards not selling their
bodies to old crewed men for sex. Doing each other's make-up in front of
the mirror and chatting away on the bed with no care in the world, aiming
at persuading me to see the highlights of the life Ron gave them and they
almost did. Ron left the room for a few moments, letting us all get to
know each other a little better and that's when I started to compile an
understanding of what really went on here.
Just catching a bit of their conversation from before my introduction, I
heard them chatting about the night they were preparing for. Speaking
excitedly about some men they would be entertaining in a few hours, one
girl was talking about going out to sea with one o these clients on a yacht
for a few days. Since none of the girls seemed shy to talk about their
professions or anything for that matter, I decided to ask them a few
questions about what they did. They were more than happy to expand on
their point of view in the conversation, attempting to paint a pretty picture
of what they were paid to do.
They all began to jump up and down with excitement like giddy school
girls at a slumber party. Another girl with jet-black hair and a thick
accent, wearing absolutely nothing at all, grabbed me onto the bed with
them and into their fiasco, instantly making me feel accepted into their
sopriy like moraly delail ed seachera for one any trend on to
howevery a wanty teauit pit by their ide so we come nak e

of view while playing with my hair, they were taking turns brushing and
styling it as they were filling my head with all of the prospects I could
have as an escort too. They made me feel beautiful like them, too
beautiful for what a girl beyond my years should feel. I was simply being
lured into dach alus trap us for wey had en ala young ag oney
they would make and the lifestyle they were given. Their enthusiasm only
interested me further, making it not only sound like an acceptable way of
living but also appearing to keep them all vivaciously satisfied. This way

I would always dread the end of every night, fearing what new desires
he had in-store for the evening. Sometimes he would hurt me and tell me
to try and enjoy it then do it over and over again until I gave him exactly
what he wanted, I always resisted until I could no more, he was too
overpowering and relentless at getting the results he wanted. At other
times he could be so gentle and caress my skin, worshiping every inch of
my body, all relying upon on what mood he was in. Often though he liked
to play the teacher role and instruct me on every motion and explain what.
would happen when I did those certain things to him. No matter what he
did to me I was only disgusted with myself more and more. I still shudder
at the thought of how he used my body.
I turned fourteen in August that same year and was spending my
birthday loaded on a concoction of pharmaceuticals and alcohol, being
generously supplied by the very man who swore his devotion to caring
for my every need. I didn't even know myself any longer, completely
shying away from the girl I had grown up to be until to this point. The
apartment was empty except for me, for the time being, and that was
God's own little present for me... some solitude for once I thought.
Pouring myself another drink I opened the sliding glass doors to the
balcony and walked to the edge. Looking down from the many stories
where Ron's apartinent was, I wished myself a happy birthday out loud
and wondered if my family even remembered the day's occurrence.
Dwelling in my sadness for the fourteen years of suffering and
loneliness I had already endured, the tears swelled up in my eyes,
trickling downwards making my eyeliner inevitably leak down my
cheeks. Inside I felt so trapped and began to entertain the thought of
jumping over the edge, it all seemed much easier, and the simple
blackness that death had to offer rather than the tangled mess I was so
tired of fighting to get out of seemed a much easier approach. Detached
from wanting to feel anything, 1 became so numb towards my life's own
tragedies. I couldn't live like this any longer. I lifted my bare legs over
the edge of the railing and sat looking at the ground beneath me so close
to even just slipping off the edge to my very death. I couldn't think of any
reason not to fall. I thought I had made too many bad decisions to keep
going on but some force of a higher nature had other things in store for
The sliding door slammed open with a burst of speed and Ron scooped
me up in his big arms and brought me inside to our bedroom. Laying me
down and seeing the look of despair in my eyes from my tear stained face
he went into the bathroom cupboard and returned with three pink pills.
Forcing me to swallow them using the angered tone of his voice he
thought he was turning my sorrows into a distant dream as I passed out in
his tight clutches, crying myself all the way to sleep. He didn't even ask
me what was wrong, probably because he knew already.
Soon enough the crumbling of his evil empire in the underworld of
selling sex for his own advantage began with a single crack in his perfect
scheme, and proudly it all started with me. Ron got a scare one-day and
rampaged through his apartment telling us giris to only pack our
important belongings and some clothes as we all had to leave right away.
I didn't have much belonging to me so I basically sat there watching
everyone rush around frantically and was curious what could've gotten a
man like Ron so scarred. Once we were packed up and in the limo he was
trying to calm the frantic girls down after all the panic that spread through
the apartment like wildfire, I was the only one sitting there half amused at
He began by assuring us that everything was going to be fine. Calmly
he continued to tell all of us packed in tightly, even for a limo, that we
were all taking a long trip to Florida's countryside because someone has
reported an anonymous tip to the missing persons unit at the local police
station identifying a very young girl as a possible victim of abuse living
at his apartment. Ron knew what a landmine of trouble he had brought
upon himself making an exhibition out of me on the streets of Miami, I
didn't pull off the older look like the other girls, I actually looked
younger than my age with my blue eyes and freckles always giving the
impression of my youthful innocence.
Now he just had to do whatever it took to ensure he stayed as far away
from the authorities as possible. Arriving at a ranch in central Florida
many hours later and I assumed it belonged to Ron knowing never to ask
him things like that. I knew my purpose and it wasn't prying into his
personal life outside of the bedroom. There was a main house, a few
cottages, some staff quarters and paddocks where the horses were kept. I
was in heaven...I thought at first. Finally, something I could really enjoy.
Riding was my passion, basically growing up on the backs of horses since
I was just able to walk.
Not surprisingly I began to despise Ron and all of the girls for the
gross exploits they made me do with them. Beginning to isolate myself
from everyone l'd rather spend my time sitting under a tree watching the
horses graze, writing in my journal or painting but mostly avoiding
everyone possible unless Ron required me elsewhere. Nighttime was
always a reoccurring nightmare for me. Relived over and over again in
many various ways. Ron would always start by making me some drinks
and offering an assortment of pills before indulging himself by
grotesquely putting his genitals in my mouth and tell me how to give him
what he would call a "first-class blow-job",
', and I was being judged every
minute of it. Ordering me to slowdown or speedup or maintain a perfect

rhythm I was constantly being criticized for my efforts in pleasing him. I
was eager when he actually gave me a compliment. The rest of the
evening was always a surprise left up to a moments notice. Quite
regularly he would proceed with having the girls dress me up in some
sexy outfit and loads of makeup then entertain him with a lesbian
reenactment revolving him in the center. Sometimes they would use
dildos and other foreign sex toys, Ron liked to see us hurt during sex,
sometimes even penetrating me anally but I always resisted and would try
to redirect him with another sexual desire of his but I had no excuses
when it came to me having to use the sex toys on him, he told me how
men have g-spots in their rectum and instructed me on how to precisely
penetrate him. These nights went on what seemed like an eternal sentence
for the price of not living on the streets, where unfortunately for the one's
still there, I feared and knew from my own personal experience, could be
Needing some contact with someone of my adolescent mentality I
called one of my school friends from the past, whom I wont name out of
privacy, but I'll call him T.J. We were so close and I knew very well, so
well, I had memorized his number a long time before. He was my first
puppy love sprung from of a childhood friendship. Being my very first
crush the summer before all of this happened he was the only person I
could think of that would care enough to talk to me.
In the middle of the day, the least busy time to be noticed, I snuck into
one of the vacant guest rooms and used the phone to call my good friend.
The sound of my voice radiated a chill in him. "It's you, oh my God
Jenna! Are you okay?" he was so shocked to hear from me and the sheer
fact I was still alive. Nearly three months now without a single word to
my family or friends, every one doubted my return. My attempt to forge a
happy voice when I spoke to him failed and I absolutely crumbled when
he was at a loss for kind words for me. I told him of my current state of
affairs. Telling him of Ron and how I was terrified of him, trying to
escape in the middle of nowhere was useless. It was like being kept in
cage that I was unable to break free from. Going on to dump my issues on
T.J. I proceeded with how I longed to call my family and to be with my
them for good but was too afraid they didn't want me, knowing I'd just
be sent away somewhere else again and to me after all this time was like
going from one cage to another.
He had been called by them numerously and promised me that they
were very worried and even hired private investigators to try and find me.
Given I was eleven years old the first time I was sent away, my trust in
there sincerity he spoke about was seriously doubted. I kept the
conversation short just in case my absence was being noticed and I left on
the note that I would speak to him again shortly. His attempts to get off
the phone were nothing short of desperate plea to keep me on as long as
possible. I thought he was just trying to help in someway. Giving him
assurance in the fact I had survived this long obviously I can hold off a
while longer I gave him my love and told him I'd be in touch.
Thinking I had slipped away unnoticed I entered into the room that I
shared with Ron, hoping I got away with my brief and very needed phone
call. The place looked empty and everyone else seemed to be out and
about so I decided to have a bath in the spa and try to relax before the
night's precautions. My body glided into the steamy water as I began to
think about T.J and how good it felt just to hear from a friendly voice. My
thoughts drifted into the days 1 missed when I felt I could be silly and
childlike and I nearly forgot for a moment how grown up 1 was acting
these days.
My first glimpse at the image surrounding me when 1 resurfaced above
the water was daunting. There was Ron was standing over my tub,
looking down at me with an eager display of his arousal. He began to
undo his pants and take them down when he told me "put your lips on my
cock", I was too slow in responding to his request so he grabbed me by
the back of the head and forced me into his groin. I had tears streaming
down my face as I looked up to him with the saddest blue eyes hoping he
would take pity and stop, but he never did. I was really hurt by his
aggression and he definitely knew it this time, which I believe only made
him more heated. I closed my eyes and began to count using the time to
keep my thoughts elsewhere believing every number I counted only
furthered me to the end of this. I just got over a hundred when he finally
exploded in fulfillment still half submerged in the deep bath I was
struggling to gain my bearings in as Ron was picked me up out of the
bath and carried me to go to the bedroom, which was just outside the
French adjoin doors. Still damp from the hot water in the spa I had goose
bumps from the chill of the fresh air where he brought me to the bed and
Procee no deeply er a beneate and would even try on through he
years to come.
Upon his bursting with pleasure for the second time, he just got up
and left, without even saying a word to me. Left alone I was awake for
hours after that. There was no escaping the pain that night. I lay naked
wrapped in the sheets, sobbing in the dark. My feelings of being hurt and
disgusted after his abusive ordeal "When will it ever stop" I prayed to
God and begged for death rather than face another day in my life. I woke
up still alone the next day and exasperated from the misery i felt the night
before. Ushering through my drawers to find something to throw on I
could care less what lay in store for me today, couldn't be as bad as being
raped by a scary man repeatedly.

Starting my day with a few of the supplied oxytocin's and a bloody
mary, made by the live-in house chef. Having two celery sticks for my
breakfast, I wanted to lye out by the pool and forget the world. Ron hated
tan-lines so to be caught with a bikini top on was a big no-no in his rule
book but after my cries to stop were so blatantly ignored last night, I was
out to piss him off so I didn't remove my shirt. I put on my headphones
and before 1 knew it had fallen into a deep slumber from my self-made
therapeutic cocktail, the only way I knew how to cope with the emotional
Desperate to hear his voice 1 called my friend T.J a few more times that
week. I needed to feel like someone out there really knew me. Sometimes
we could just chat like old friends with no care in the world and laugh at
a distant memory from too long ago. Then would come the good-bye part
of the conversation and we would both get teary-eyed not knowing what
could happen next or if this would even be the last time we ever spoke to
each other again.
My biggest fear came to reality when I was in our bedroom one
afternoon, just lounging around out of boredom. Ron came bursting in
through the door, red as a tomato. I couldn't help but feeling I was in big
trouble. His face was distorted and raging towards me. I knew right away
he must have found out that I was calling T.J, but how, I had no idea. I
had always tried to be as invisible as possible, soon enough it was all
"Are you trying to get me caught? You are nothing but a stupid girl
you know that! What am I supposed to do with you now?" He was
tearing up the room while his rants gave me something else to think
about. What would he do with me if he had no use for me any longer? I
wasn't even thinking about him being caught for soliciting illegal
immigrants for the purpose of prostitution. I was more worried that he
would be upset at the fact I was talking to another guy, maybe even
jealous that he was at least my age. I replied with simple sentences that I
could manage to get out between all the shouting. I kept saying, "I'm
sorry" and putting my head down in shame. He picked me up by my
throat pinning me against the wall, "You are going away, far -far away
from me and you better be nicer to the next man I send you to, I've heard
he's not a nice as most would like. Are you fucking hearing me Bitch?' I
slid down the wall, choking on the first air entering my lungs, breathless
and terrified, I never thought Ron was a nice guy but I had never seen
him lose it this bad. Now I was being sent me away to another stranger,
another man, it only terrified me more.
The girls came in to say their good-byes all of them were crying and
asking me in their best English languages, why 1 had to call someone and
lose everything? 1 was able to find out through the broken sobs off of
them that the confession came from the house-keeper who said she saw
me use the room regularly but was never messed up, so Ron looked at the
recent telephone bills and found the same number dialed from that room
consecutively, he knew it was me right away. At least he didn't know it
was another guy, I thought to myself, or I probably wouldn't have made it
out of there alive.
Ron came back to usher the girls out of my room and told me I had five
minutes to pack my clothes, which he made clear were to be my only
belongings to take with me. He washed his hands clean of me that night,
or so he thought. The driver came knocking at my door, just as Ron said,
no longer than the five minutes that he had offered me and he took my
single bag to the car. I didn't want all the jewelry, music or books that he
so caringly bought me as tokens of his twisted affection. Only taking my
clothes and a wad of hundred dollar bills I had been saving, I slit a hole in
my scrunchie inserting my cash for a rainy day that I was more than sure
was just around the corner..
We drove for hours, until I started seeing familiar surroundings. I
couldn't believe my own eyes. I was back in Miami, but not on the
beaches, somewhere in the CBD this time. The Driver delivered me to the
front door with my one bag and waited at the door with me. Now I knew
how it felt to be a puppy picked from her litter as you can only hope your
next owner would treat you with some sort of kindness.
Another balding man answered the door but he wasn't so grotesquely
fat like Ron, but still a new owner at that. He looked me up and down and
seemed amused as he snickered to himself. With one last look to the
driver over my shoulder it was almost an appeal to him for some way to
help me. I knew he couldn't anyways, I was just hoping. He told me his
name was Charlie but didn't even bother in asking me for mine. I was
sure Ron already filled in all of my details when he arranged this.
Charlie picked up my bag and led me into his bachelor pad townhouse.
I was never given a welcoming tour of my new residence or made to feel
comfortable. He walked me up the stairs and opened one of the doors in
the small hallway. Telling me this would be my room, he showed me into
it and told me to wait, he would be back shortly. I sat on my bed afraid to
touch anything and after the warning Ron gave me I knew I had to watch
my step around here. I put my head down onto the pillows my where
world was falling apart and let my emotions downpour. Exhausted from
the days emotional turmoil I ended up falling asleep. I don't even know if
he ever came in at all that night.
The next morning I looked out of the window to see my new
surroundings. It was a beautiful sunny day outside, unlike the dreary cell
I was locked away inside of. Feeling the sun warm up my face through
the glass, it radiated a familiar sense of comfort from the days of the good

parts of my childhood. I reminisced how it had used to be before all my
life turned upside down. Before all of the fights with my family, before I
had to look after myself, and before I was a slave to men.
Those days were too long gone now. With too many hard times passing
me by it seemed surreal to think that life had ever even existed in the first
place. With that thought I shook myself out of reminiscing that way.
Whatever was going to happen was out of my control now, I just had to
give myself some hope that I would have the strength to get myself out
these circumstances before anything really bad happened.
Chapter 2
The house was quiet so I just assumed Charlie was still asleep. I
decided to get cleaned up and have a shower. Not even a knock on the
door when Charlie walked in with ease. "Typical" I thought. It was an
easy way for Charlie to break the ice. "You really are as beautiful as Ron
said" as he opened the curtain. Watching me rinse myself in the shower
and me knowing I had no way out of this except to go along with
whatever he wanted. I just looked down at the mention of Ron's name,
wondering what else he had told Charlie about me. Realizing later that he
wouldn't have said anything anyways, in fear I would've been a damaged
product that wouldn't make him the money that young girls go for.
He just sat on the side of the vanity top and continued to take
observations of me standing submerged under the falling water. I avoided
looking at him and let him do all the talking, after all I knew what I had
10s a vas eating downtaner tha isid could sighing like Ron ranteen
about some club and restaurant he owned in FT. Lauderdale. He said he
was going to take me shopping for some club outfits and we would party
together tonight, as if I was supposed to be excited over this so-called
I looked up and gave him a quick smile adding a compliant nod and
turned my attention to turning off the faucets and quickly grabbing my
towel. I was falling so far from who I used to be, shying away from my
outgoing personality to a quiet girl that didn't even recognize herself in
the mirror anymore. I dried myself off and looked at the man standing
between the doorway and me. He was still watching me with a sleazy
look on his face but now preceded to move in my direction, arms wide
open. He embraced me, running his hands up around my youthful curves,
licking my neck and earlobes. Then his large, rough hands cupped my
small breasts and continued downwards to feel in between my legs. I
knew what I had to do to get this over and done with as quick as possible,
but I was dreading this moment from the second he greeted me at the
I fell to my knees and gave into his demented perversions. Thankfully
it didn't last long before he climaxed and I was allowed to get myself
dressed and ready to go out. I was nothing but money well spent in his
mind. This was another extremely wealthy man with a completely new
set of wants and needs asking a fourteen year old girl to affectionately
dote on sexual desires to a man in his mid forties. I really hated myself,
these men, and just about everything my life had boiled up to by this
point, but I knew from a young age that to survive in this harsh world I
would have to do many things I would not willingly choose to.
At the shops he decided he would choose the clothes he paid for, which
I might as well have been declared a teenage prostitute. Just like Ron he
also liked it that way. The more degrading he was to me only proved his
ownership of my body. He bought me tiny cocktail dresses, and skimpy
outfits, which I thought closely, resembled the lingerie he'd also bought
for me to wear for him. I noticed that day that he enjoyed parading me
around the shopping mall and out for lunch at hooters, even joking with
the waitress that he'd like to buy her uniform because he thought it'd look
sexy on his new girlfriend.
We arrived at his two in one, Restaurant and Club, at around nine
o'clock in the evening. It was a revolving tower called "Hot Chocolates"
in downtown Ft. Lauderdale. The food was delicious and for the first time
since being with Ron, I ordered a hefty meal with steak and mashed
potatoes with a scrumptious gravy smothered on top. Charlie ordered
strong cocktails for us both and before 1 knew it my head was spinning
and we were on the dance floor together. The music blared in my head
and the rhythm of my body took over, completely forgetting about even
dancing with Charlie and letting the music take ahold and work it's
It didn't do me any justice though as Charlie watched me imagining
what pleasures lay in store for him later on. Taking me home before the
club had even closed, he just couldn't wait to indulge on exactly what he
was fantasizing from beforehand. Once back at his townhouse he led me
up the stairs into his bedroom and pushed me down in the middle of his
bed. The motions from the wavy mattress made me dizzy and feel even
drunker when he lay on top of me. Coming at me like a hungered beast
wanting to ravage his next meal, it was intimidating as he entered into me
with a forceful thrust, he moaned out in delectable heaves. I looked away
while he self indulged his own gratifying needs using my body as his
instrument in pleasure. I only grew stronger in my head letting the hatred
for men desires intensify.

The next two weeks I was expected to be at Charlie's beckon call, never
aloud to leave his side, even making me sleep in his bed from the second
night onwards. I never even got the chance to call T.J again. It was too
much of a risk anyways. Thus pushing him further out of my memory,
too afraid, of the emotional repercussions.
Our typical routine was to wake up get showered and dressed and I
would put on my make-up while Charlie made his business calls for the
day. We would leave the house mid-afternoon and run his errands do
some shopping, sometimes meeting his friends or business partners for
lunch, none of the men he introduced me to seemed offended at his
choice of adolescent eye candy. They'd just continue to chat away as if it
was normal to be in public with his arms draped over a girl young enough
to be his granddaughter, not too shy by giving me a flirty tap on my
My last night was no different from every other night. We went
shopping that day and out for lunch alone. Later we headed to a club his
friend just launched and it was his grand opening that night. The club was
called "Iguana Joe's". We met up with his friend and said our hellos.
They both seemed so excited about the club and Charlie was full of
compliments all around. The club did have a line out the door which
looked a mile long coming in, luckily we didn't have to use the front
door. Charlie returned from the bar with two giant long-island iced teas,
which were his favorite drink to start with and then we just sat for a while
watching people dancing. Occasionally conversing about passing
thoughts. We danced for a while having a few more drinks and after
about two hours, Charlie said he was ready to go home. What a daunting
time to look forward to, he always liked to have a brief sexual encounter
before drifting off to sleep with my naked body intertwined between his
It was bad enough to have to entertain him at every given second of the
day but his grip on me was so stifling 1 felt so chocked I could hardly
breathe much less sleep. Eventually my over-worked mind would drift in-
and-out of a restless sleep, but constantly on edge. I thought many of
nights of escaping, but where would I go? Would one of Ron's ever-so-
connected informants finds me and turns me into him to be disposed of
for good? I just prayed that I wouldn't be another missing person to add
to the list of girls found in the local ditches. I knew that's where I was
headed if I screwed this up for Ron again.
As if my guardian angel was there the whole time listening to my
secret prayers, my rescue came the next morning with an abrupt bursting
through the bedroom door at about six am. Charlie and I were still lying
in bed together and his grip on me was still tight. The men dressed in all
black military gear had large guns and helmets on. It was so frightening
at first. I couldn't even comprehend what was happening so rapidly. I
thought Charlie could've been in some kind of trouble with a business
friend he had done wrong too, but then one of the men in black shouted
"F.B.I this is a raid get down with your hands on you head", in too much
shock to move three of the men grabbed Charlie and threw him to the
floor and cuffed him. I sat up in bed with my sheets covering my naked
body and watched as they dragged Charlie from the room. Still
completely nude he wasn't even aloud to get dressed. Another agent had
to come back in to the room to find him a pair of shorts. I could hear him
screaming at the top of his lungs all of the way outside He was screaming
and the last thing I heard him yell was "If you say anything you know
who will find you!" I could hear more threats being yelled at me but I
couldn't make out what it was that he was saying. I was in total confusion
and couldn't believe what was happening. There were so many uniformed
agents I felt so small compared to all of them but they were all very kind
and helped me out of bed allowing me to remain covered up with the bed
sheets so I could get dressed. The first decency I had been showed in a
long time. It was an odd feeling to acknowledge. I knew the life I had
come accustomed to for the last six months was now over, and in so
many ways I was relieved but was also very nervous about what lay
I excused myself to the bathroom to put some clothes on. Not having
anything half decent, like a normal pair of jeans and a t-shirt. The best I
could come up with was a metallic blue miniskirt and a tiny matching top
that fell just below my breasts, hardly clothing at all it was more like
scraps of cloth. Putting my hair up in a tight bun with the scrunchie that
held my five hundred dollar bills I was led out of Charlie's townhouse for
the very last time. Starting my life over... again, I wanted to leave behind
my every memory belonging to these horrid times. Only taking small
sack containing my underwear, makeup bag, and journal with me.
The agents led me down the staircase and my last vision's of Charlie
was bent over the hood of a police vehicle still screaming and
handcuffed. I slipped into the backseat of the car and was driven to
Broward County Police Station where the Federal Agents interviewed me
about my entire whereabouts for the last six months. I was so scared of
what Ron would do if I told the agents what really happened but at the
same token I knew he'd most likely kill me anyways for being such a
liability.
Over the next few hours I sat down and told the agents how Ron's
business worked and what I part I had to play to him. I was able to ask
how they found out I was at Charlie's house and they informed me that I
was being followed all the way from Ocala, Florida where Ron had me
stowed away for the last four months. T.J, my friend, called my parents

after our first phone conversation and ever since then, the F.B.I were
tapping the phone lines and recording every conversation. Completely
unaware of T.J's caring act of deceit, I was in such shock that they had
been tracking us for so long. I knew now, with or without my help, the
F.B.I had enough on Ron to put him away for a very long time, if they
could catch him, that is.
Having so many crooked people working for you can be an advantage
when you're in trouble. Like having a pair of eyes in every city. Ron was
somehow able to find out about Charlie's arrest and immediately deserted
the country to avoid legal punishment, not to mention the discretization
of his esteemed clientele that the feds were now on to. Ron had so many
countless charges put up against him, eventually when the F.B.I were
able to track him down they were able to have him arrested in Yugoslavia
and extradited back to Miami, he was finally held accountable for being a
pedophile, soliciting women for prostitution, and running many
illegitimate and illegal businesses. By the time the F.B.I caught him he
was in his mid-seventies when he died of old age serving his second year
prison for a lengthy sentence. Coincidentally I was told of his punishment
and death many years later by one of the same F.B.I agents that had
rescued me from Charlie's arms.
I was taken out of the interrogation room after the interview was over
with and told to sit at one of the officer's desk while I was waiting for
someone to pick me up. Uncertain of who that someone would be I
assumed it would be someone from the juvenile delinquents division to
take me back to some state operated lockdown facility. Not the nicest of
places to call home, but I had no choice in this matter.
Sitting back in the revolving chair I was twirling out of boredom and
listening to the roaming conversations within the office. I pondered in
fearful anticipation of the dreadful places that lay in store for me. Having
to of spent a lot of my adolescence in these kind of places for the sheer
factor that my mother said "I was out of control and unable to handle" by
eleven years old. There was plenty of just reason for me to be so scared of
those places. What I knew lay in store for me were constant fights
between the rough girls being settled with violent raids then out came the
pepper spray and then the strip-searches and worst of all, no sunlight. It
there was a fif you were a cout a by lik a didn longee, when
person in the room was considered a threat and were treated like a violent
criminal. I hated those places and the memories they gave me. That's
why I always ended up back on the streets. No child or even a juvenile
should have to be subiected to such unreasonable force and neglect. Some
of the girls were so used to being subdued to this kind of treatment their
whole life they ended up repeating the same attributes as the people who
initially hurt them in the first place.
One very sad girl I'll never forget her, had a father who had been a
heroine junkie and decided to play Russian Roulette with some of his
addict friends and by fate or chance took the bullet straight through his
brain, killing him instantly. Her mother being a heroine addict herself
spiraled downwards after his death and gave her four year old child to her
ageing grandmother that eventually had to put my twelve year old friend
in this un-dire circumstance. I can only have he highest hopes for her
today but unfortunately for most girls that have been victimized by
society aren't able to ever stop being a victim for the rest of their lives or
go on to make other people victims themselves. A sad and unfortunate
fate for so many innocent, and it happens so much more than anyone
would rather admit too instead of just trying to find a solution.
Chapter 3
Hours later I was still twirling myself in the same office chair when I
spun around to see my Father walking in my direction. I nearly fell off
my seat at the sight of him. Gripping the chairs handles I couldn't
imagine what in the world I would say to the man I once used to call
insily dinside or me. fleco amdared put ind us arising to old me
but instead anger and shame took over and he just shook his head. I never
saw my Dad cry until that day and I have to say it made me feel young
again and sad i had disappointed my parents again. The agents now
standing beside us led both of us together back into the interrogation
room to re-tale my journey to my father who they said I had no choice to
tell, or they would have to tell him for me, being I was an under-aged
minor and Ron violated the statutory rape law, among many others, when
he took me back to his apartment and kept me as his sex slave. My Dad
couldn't believe what he was hearing and for his lack of better choice in
words asked me to stop talking, he was just happy to know I was alive.
Like everyone l'd known in life they would rather brush it under the
carpet and not deal with the pain rather than realizing sooner or later it all
comes out sometime in our life even if it transgresses into our future then
becomes what we are willing to accept out of partners, work, and people
in general. Simply saying in other ways than with words that our bad
decisions befall our tragedies later on in life.
The next discussion was led to where I would go to from here. Before
anyone could put his or her suggestion forward i leapt in with my two
bits and made it obviously clear to my Dad that if I was sent away to

another lockdown facility and if he betrayed my trust, again, he would
never see me again. I would disappear for good this time and for all he
would know I could be dead in no time on the streets. He looked at me
and for the first time in my life he saw the many years I had grown up in
the time I was gone and heard the seriousness in the tone of my voice
when I made my vow to him. He put his head in his hands and told me
the bad news, my Mom didn't want me to come home and she was
making his life hell for even suggesting bringing me back into their lives.
I for some reason threatened her lifestyle and drove her crazy. I had been
surprised about a lot of things lately but not that one. The last time I saw
my Mom she ever so carefully lied to me and told me she was bringing
me to an eye-doctor for an infection. Instead we walked into this tall blue
building with people in uniforms holding clipboards and a few muscly
guards, she ushered me inside and hurried up to close the large auto lock
doors behind her leaving me there alone and imprisoned, which is what
led me to recently living on the streets. My life was hell as long as she
was in control of it, so when she didn't want me back at home I was fine
with that too, but there had to be somewhere else I could go. My dad said
he had no choice but to put me back into the facility, but he made a
sincere promise that he would not take any longer than a week to try to
find a place for me to stay and to go to school. A week I could deal with,
but 1 was still unsure if I could trust my father and hold him to his word,
but yet again, I had no choice. Being my legal guardian he could send me
anywhere he wanted and there would be nothing I could do, except for
keep running. I gave in, and before he left the officers to take me back to
the last facility I had run from, I gave him one last hug and reminded him
"one-week and I'm gone". Nodding his head and squeezing his arms
tighter around me, I could only hope he meant it, but he didn't look too
In the police car on the way back to the facility they had to handcuff me
in case I ran again, but I had no intentions to anyways. I was going to
give my dad the week before I began to search for the right opportunity to
jolt again. I was like a "ghost come back," said so many of my girlfriends
from the past and there was now a lot of new faces there too. At night
when we were all in bed and supposed to be sleeping, I would be
daydreaming of better days and imagine myself somewhere in a
comfortable bed, actually enjoying my life for a change. A week went by
in this facility spending most of my days locked up in what they called
*The o set on. The bay confor had was the ole svet toilet or even
provided as part of the uniform, and my hair scrunchie filled with my
stowed away cash that no one had found during my unpleasant strip-
searches. I would spend hours in the white room for objecting to their
conformity and unwilling to participate in their drilling regime. I didn't
feel like I owed any explanation to these people even when they brought
a physiologist in to speak with me, "What was the point when I would be
gone any day now" and as if any of these people even cared in the first
place, I was just another number in the system and they had a job to do.
There was one mega-bitch, female guard, named Evelyn and she used
to either really like you or really hate you and God-forbid you were one
of the unfortunates that she didn't like, she'd make your entire stay their
an agonizing nightmare. Constantly picking on girls who were not strong
enough to cope with their predicament or past issues, she'd stand them up
and publicly humiliate them, and even when they begged her through
their sobs to let them sit down, she'd only torment them worse. Which
only made the strong girls want to antagonize the fragile one's with more
malicious intent. Luckily when I had previously been there she didn't:
take much notice of me, but I stayed out of harms way with her, just
being quiet and observant.
Being back here seemed like an eternity while I held my end of the
bargain but unfortunately my Father didn't. The first chance I saw to run
I took it. I was being sent to go get my blood and urine taken for drug and
disease analysis. My driver would be a volunteer from the community
and it was the perfect getaway for me. I was brought from the white
solitaire room and led into the bright sun, feeling like today would be
favorable in my escape. We got to the doctors office, my whereabouts
told me I had plenty of ways to run and I scouted out the best looking
route. My plan was to barge through the volunteer's inexperienced grip
and wriggle my way out if needed, then hit the asphalt, running until my
legs couldn't carry me any further. Playing it out in my mind felt
different to the anticipation that led up to actually doing it. The inner-
strength I had was the only thing going to help me in this circumstance.
We arrived in the parking lot and I hadn't said a word to him the entire
drive, the small framed Spanish man tried to make pleasant conversation
but I couldn't see him as anything but a challenge, so I kept quiet instead,
ignoring his humorous attempts to befriend me. The car pulled to a stop
and he came around the side to unlock my door, this was it, "here we go"
I told myself, and pushed past the volunteer. His arms grabbed out at me
but only caught me by my shirt, he didn't even put up much of a struggle,
like some of the other trained one's I had gotten before, they would put
me into body locks of all sorts but he just tore at the collar of my shirt

a sweater for disguise and my next stop was Dunkin Doughnuts' to get a
chocolate iced doughnut and a cup of coffee. I didn't have doubts about
getting out of the facility but I wasn't expecting it to be so easy this time.
My past excursions all began with an abrupt struggle sometimes ending
in a brutal state of affairs after being pepper sprayed and fastened into
some painful lock by forceful men four- times my size, then tossed into
solitary until I saw my next chance to desert. I got to know the guards
real well, as I spent a lot of my time being dragged down to the white
room by them. There was Jim, a large black man who could've doubled
for a "Miami Dolphin's" defensive linebacker. John was another big man
with a ponytail and a mustache, and he looked like someone who
definitely owned a Harley. The last guy Scott had a smaller build but
made up for it with his steroid injected museles bulging out of his neck
and their was the added height from his curly fro. When they weren't
restraining me and holding me captive in solitaire, they were actually
pretty nice guys, not afraid to have a laugh after some explosive incident
and I held no contempt towards them either, they were just doing their
It was de'ja'vous all over again, free at last but where would I go now.
With Ron's scouts on the lookout for me, and now the authorities being
notified I was a runaway again, I would have a lot of people searching for
me, so I knew I had to be careful where I went. My last stop before
leaving the shopping center was to use a payphone to call my parents, my
Dad answered completely surprised to hear me on the other end, I wanted
to sarcastically thank him for breaking his promise to me and I hope he is
happy now, he just lost his daughter for good. I stopped to listen to what
he was trying to say and he told me "I was getting you out in a few days,
I found you somebody to stay with, she's a good person who has got
teenagers your age, I was just trying to convince your Mother to sign the
papers to get you out of there".
i was so outraged at her ability to put her own wants before the needs
of her own flesh and blood daughter. I told him to come pick me up and
bring me to the house so I could speak with her for the first time in over a
year, but if I felt threatened for one second I will be on my way quicker
than a blink of an eye and on my own for good. He wasn't overjoyed at
my proposition, knowing what position this put him in as her husband but
as my father he decided to put me first for once and take me home to
confront my mother.
I arrived at my house for the first time in a long time and everything
looked different. My parents refurnished and renovated the house. I didn't
even have a room anymore, my old belongings and bed were removed
and it ron or eter or lost espring redied No instead he gale
waited for me to come find her outback smoking cigarettes and having a
beer. She stood up from her seat and squinted her eyes loathing in her
hatred she coldly slapped me hard in the face. The slap stung, but I
matched her look with a familiar stone-coldness that only she could
understand. Immediately we both started to cry and we washed away our
anguish and resentment through our tears and consolidated our feelings
for the first time since the chaos first affected our lives. She didn't want
to know much of my whereabouts and she still had a lot of anger to get
over but she asked me to stay home at least. My little brother ran through
the back door and hugged me so tight, I started to cry again and was
saddened by how much time I had missed the time I had lost just hanging
out with my brothers and it took me even longer to realize how precious
time really is. We were never going to be the average Joes next door but
at least this was better than nothing. I loved being with my family again.
We had BBQ's and bon-fires with each other and life began to slowly
piece back together. It was bizarre how normal it was when I first got
home. I turned fifteen that year and it was the exact cup of tea that I had
needed to boost me up and get me on the right track.
I decided to go school to acquire my general education diploma or G.E.D
and got a summer job with my Dad at Mar-A-Lago, Donald Trumps
exclusive country club in Palm Beach. Surrounded by lush acres of
tropical landscapes, manicured gardens, and a mansion made into a beach
club for the rich and famous it is known as the "Jewel of Palm Beach". I
was in sheer awe at the gold arched ceilings and the grandeur ballrooms.
The spa where I worked was world class, not only oozing in style but in
the way each and every clientele was treated with the upmost service. My
focus was now set on becoming a massage therapist, and working my
way into a luxurious spa like the one I worked for now, only I was a
locker-room attendant there. I studied many books about the anatomy of
the human body and how you can affect a person's well-being and health
for the better through a simple healing touch. It was amazing to me the
way the body responded to massage. I was more than just interested. T
was determined to become a therapist.
It was one of those anatomy books that I had my nose buried in one
afternoon on a quiet Tuesday and it could get pretty lonely in the locker
room, so if I weren't busy l'd sit outside by the spa's reception and read
my books in the warmth of the Florida sun. A lovely looking woman in
her late thirties who spoke with a proper English accent approached me. I
assumed it was a general question, "like where's the ladies room or was
that the famous model from so-and-so?" but she was more interested in
the book I was reading. Only believing at first we were just making small
talk she was really intrigued at my choice of reading. She then asked if I

did massage on the side, I stated I was only reading the book and had not
yet began to study but one day 1 would love to practice massage therapy.
She introduced herself as Ghislane Maxwell. I would later find out that
she was the daughter of the late prominent businessman and disgraced
newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell. I told her my name is Jenna pointing
to my nametag on my shirt and offered her a cold or hot beverage, as
those were my instructed duties at work. She accepted a tea and went on
to chat a bit about this rich guy that she worked for and she knew off-
hand that he was looking for a massage therapist. Just doing me a good
deed out of her kindness of her heart, I'm sure, she offered to introduce
me to him. I declined her first proposition, thinking out loud, told her I
didn't know the body well enough to even attempt an interview. She
didn't seem worried at all by my fear of incompetence saying that if he
liked me enough he would get me the best training in the industry.
Ghislane thought I had a cheery persona and fit the quota for what he was
looking for and as she put it an enthusiastic learner that she said she
gathered from the sticky notes popping out of the various sections in my
book. I accepted her phone number and the house address and told her I
will call her if I am able to come over after work. I rushed over to the
tennis courts where my dad was working and told him of the news. We
both thought this could be a wonderful opportunity to get my
accreditation in massage therapy. Seeing that it was a lady in her late
thirties who came off as more of a nurturer rather than a procurer, neither
of' us saw any reason to be hesitant.
Chapter 4
At around Five p.m. my dad drove me down to the bottom of "El Brillo
Way." on the Palm Beach intercostal. We pulled into a short driveway
beckoning a large pink mansion with heavy wooden doors. I was so
excited the sked may dad to wish me luck. He gave me
a big squeeze and wished me the best. He walked me to the front door
and i rung the door chime. Moments later we were greeted by an older
gentleman dressed in a casual butler uniform. I told him I was here to
meet Ms. Maxwell for a massage trial and he opened the doors for my
father and I telling us to wait in the entry as Ms. Maxwell would be on
her way any second, and she was. Down the stairs she walked with a
warm smile, her short black hair seeming very proper and elegant, for
now. She shook my fathers hand and thanked him for bringing me and
kissed us both on the cheeks. They spoke briefly about whom she worked
for and about Mar-a-Lago where we worked. She was in hurry, you could
tell to end the conversation and say good-bye to my dad, which she did so
ever pleasantly. She said the boss was upstairs and waiting my arrival, so
with that I said bye to my dad and began to follow Ghislane up the stairs.
I was so nervous, but I didn't show it. I kept my reserve and demeanor
cool as ice, trying show maturity for the open position. We continued on
to the massage room, passing by a grand crystal chandelier, and a couple
lengthy wooden hall tables displaying a multitude of photos displaying
young girls and beautiful women, trying not to gawk at them I didn't
even notice that some of those girls were only wearing their smile.
Ghislane asked me how my day at work was and I told her it was easy
peasy as always just trying to make simple conversation. There was a
fork at the end of the staircase and she led me to the right hand side. The
lights were dimmed in the bedroom but I could still see the King Size bed
in the middle of room, we did a U-turn around the bed, which led us into
a massage room. Dripping in luxury I could've definitely compared it to
the renowned Mar-a-Lago's spa's, it had marble walls and a glass
enclosed shower and self-automated steam room at the very end of the
Burberry carpeted room. There was a large mirror over a basin to the
right of the room with an array of oils, ointments, soaps, and lotions and a
small closed door, which I assumed must be a closet. The only thing that
struck awkward about this room was the naked man laying face down
atop of the turquoise massage table in the center of it. "I had to be
prepared for this," I told myself. Massage was something I had never
done before so 1 quickly brushed away my thoughts of possible schemes,
wanting to believe whole-hearted this was going to be legit. Ghislane
introduced us to each other and I proceeded to make his acquaintance.
Looking up at from his downwards position, he looked me over and
gave a smile to Ghislane, an obvious notion of his approval. He was
Jeffrey Epstein as she pronounced for him, as if I supposed to recognize
his name or something. He affirmed, "It was his pleasure" and replied to
just call him Jeffrey, "No need for formalities" he answered, cleverly
putting me at ease. This man did not look like someone to beware of.
Both him and Ghislane appeared to be very nice people and conscious of
their health as their need for massages and spa visits, no alarm bells went
off, yet. I was prepped by Ghislane to "treat this as a lesson from her and
follow her exact lead, if I did good tonight then maybe I would become
Jeffrey's Travelling Masseuse, seeing the world and getting paid well for
it". I was very hopeful, a job like this could really make my dreams come
I followed suit and washed my hands with warm water so the coldness
would not shock Jeffery's naked body, then lathered them in rich body
butter. Ghislane told me to always keep one hand on Jeffrey, even when
getting more lotion, so it didn't make him lose concentration on being
relaxed. She gave me a tip and told me to keep a blob of lotion high up on

my forearm so it prevented me from having to keep going back for more
and was less disruptive to Jeffrey. This all seemed for real to begin with, I
was being educated about the body and splitting Jeffrey's body with
Ghislane, mimicking her every motion. Starting with his feet, we began
with his heels and arches of his soles. Pushing the blood up his calves in
upward strokes to rejuvenate the body's blood supply and being careful to
mind his leg hair didn't pull. I was keeping up with her and enjoying the
education. It was so interesting how the body worked and I couldn't
believe I was learning all of this for free. Once I got a bit of a groove
following Ghislane, they began asking me all sorts of questions about my
past and it didn't take long before the conversation led down the darker
experiences of my young life. When they found out that I hadn't led
much of a normal existence they only probed me with more questions,
which being put on the spot answered honestly. The funny thing was they
didn't seem appalled at all by my statements, rather entertained if
anything. Jeffrey called me a "naughty-girl" with that wry smile of his,
and half playful and half defensive, I answered "no I'm not, I'm really a
good girl, just always in the wrong places" he then replied, "It's O.K, I
like naughty girls" and rolled over onto his front side to expose his
complete nude self. He wasn't the first man to show me his penis, so I
wasn't shocked at the appearance of his manhood but I was incredibly
shocked at his complete ease to present himself with an erection. I tried to
ignore it waiting to follow the next directions off of Ghislane, who
surprisingly now stood behind me bare breasted. Before I had a chance to
even think of replying hastily she began to slowly undress me, while
Jeffrey started to stroke his manhood while watching us. She unbuttoned
my blouse and removed my bra, revealing my bosoms. Cupping them in
her hands she moved her lips across my nipples, licking and teasing them
with her tongue making them cold and stiff. Next her hands moved down
to my little white skirt, removing the final piece of my remaining
uniform. She slid my skirt down my legs with ease, for a moment keeping
on my love-heart panties, so they could both take notice of my apparent
youth. They even snickered to each other about " How cute she still wears
little girl Dantie's" Jeffrey said, and Ghislane joined in his laughter.
Acting as my madam, she instructed me to start by licking his nipples
and after I had sufficiently pleasured both of them, then prompted me to
go down on Jeffery orally while she rubbed her breasts along his body
tantalizingly. She moved behind me again this time to remove my panties
and start fondling the delicate folds between my legs. I was still in shock
from the initial degrading blow. I hadn't even let the reality sink in, it was
all too much for me to emotionally handle so instead I hid behind my
fears, which I told myself "I wasn't going to ever be worth anything at all
and this would probably be as good as it gets for me" after all I thought,
"what have I been trained up for until now". Nobody ever stopped to ask
if I was comfortable or if I wanted to stop, no, instead, Ghislane only
directed me to conclude the massage session by climbing up on the table
to be fixated on Jeffrey, straddling him so he could penetrate me.
When it was all done and over with, I was taken into the steam room
with just Jeffrey to get further aquatinted, as Ghislane left the room to go
get dressed. He asked me to grab his feet and rub them not saying a word
about what just happened, like it was all normal and accepted. I listened
to him ramble on about the health benefits of a sauna and the history of it,
ignoring the fact of the matter of his pretentiousness degrading my spirit.
I figured I had gone too far already, what would be the point in throwing
in the towel now after I had done exactly what these people wanted.
Whilst we were sweating out our bodies' toxins, and the steam was
blasting my burning face I listened to his lessons, entertaining his ego, l
let him become my teacher, he seemed to like that. He sounded like a
very clever and intelligent man though. Telling me his story of how he
made himself an empire of billions from being a middle-class professor to
an elite financial advisor for clientele with only billions in their bank
accounts and through his so-called "lessons", He became my mentor and
I emerged as his pupil, the teacher's pet.
After the sauna we went to the next glass door beside us where the
shower was. He turned tap outwards and stood underneath the water as I
stood naked and cold from the temperature difference. Instead of asking
me to join him under the warm stream, like I thought he was going to, he
handed me a bar of soap and asked me to wash his body from top to toe.
It didn't stop there I had to massage the shampoo and conditioner into his
scalp as well. I was bewildered someone would ask this off of someone
else, wasn't it belittling enough having to endure the illicit massage from
beforehand but now this. The surprises kept coming that night, as this
was definitely not how I expected my interview to turn out, but that's
what I had learned in my short time on this earth, life was full of
disappointment.
I let everyone else take the power of authority from myself and use me
in whatever way he or she wanted instead of standing up and giving
myself the respect I deserved, which in turn would've helped me get
through life without all of the abuse I ended up copping. Not given the
belief in myself from an early age on I suppose is what affected my sense
of control. Always letting the one's with power and strength reduce my
inner-self to shreds until I was cut so tiny in size I would be completely
subdued to only their wants and needs left ignoring mine. The men I had
encountered in my short experience with them only repeated their
inflictions convincing me there was no running away from the sick world
I lived in, not yet understanding it all came down to the choices I had

inade for myself, I needed some encouragement and the right words to
unlock my very soul.
Jeffrey told me the towels were on the heated rack just outside the
shower and asked me to get one and pat him down. Again putting himself
first as I sat there freezing while I compliantly patted down his body with
the white fluffy towel until he was dried. I nearly expected him to ask me
to dress him as well, but not surprisingly that came later down the track
too. I dried myself off and wiped the make-up from under my eye's,
keeping quiet not sure what to really say and half-embarrassed from the
entire evening's events that just took place. I just remained silent whilst
we both got dressed until he brought me downstairs where Ghislane was
sitting at a desk holding his black leather duffel bag. When she moved
from the chair to let Jeffrey sit down, she passed him the bag and began
to tell me that I had great potential to be a massage therapist, they really
liked my style and who knows where this could lead too. She asked to see
me again tomorrow, same time after work. He opened the bag, revealing
stacks of brand-new hundred dollar bills separated with rubber bands to
count by the thousands. He grabbed one stack and took out two crisp
notes, placing them in my hand. He laughed that it was nearly my whole
week's wage at Mar-A-Lago. Only there I didn't have to degrade myself
as his new little toy.
When I got home my parents were anticipating my arrival. I kept it
simple and sweet with my folk's, only telling them of the lessons about
the body I had received and the future prospects in massage therapy that
lie ahead. Nobody questioned who I was working for and complimented
my ability to be a hard worker. I quickly got out of that conversation
afraid I might give away a hint of shame in my eyes but no one caught
on. I excused myself to the bathroom to have a shower and stared into the
mirror for a moment, asking myself if I could really go through with this
only to mentally respond by reminding myself this would be as good as it
gets for a girl of my stature and limitations. I scrubbed myself rigidly in
the shower as if it would wash away the filthiness of the night, but it
didn't help, I could still feel their hands in me and all over me and inside
of me. Trying to sleep that night was nearly impossible too, closing my
eves only to drift away to flashbacks of the moments I had to give myself
to Jeffrey and Ghislane, each replay an exploitation of my vulnerability.
The next morning I awoke feeling anxious about the day ahead, trying to
push yesterday's memory from my thoughts, I was quiet for the whole
trip to work with my Dad. Before we got out of his car in the parking lot
he asked me if everything was okay, L lied, for his sake and mine. My life
was being transformed and I didn't even know it yet, but soon enough I
would be a brainwashed tool only used for the sexual pleasure of others.
About to be entrapped in the same life I had broken free from only
Convincing myself in order to succeed I had to step up from being a
girly teenager and start thinking like a young woman, it would be my
ticket to a great career and a fortunate life. I told myself "So what if I had
to bargain my body to this rich old geezer, some girls get themselves
through college by becoming a stripper and using their bodies to pay for
degrees, others go down even worse paths." I guess it was just another
way to fathom the road I was going down, the effectiveness of the lies I
forced myself to believe was working as I continued to tell myself I had
to make it any way I could rather than ever letting myself sleep on the
streets again. I was trading one shocking lifestyle for another, thinking !
was choosing the right one. If I could go back in time to ever meet myself
I would choose this time in my life. I'd start with a good hard smack to
my head to first shake some things up in there and next I would tell that
girl she could actually make it on her own if she just worked hard at
earning an honest wage and built her life up slowly. There is no rush or
time limit to ever stop reaching for achievement. Sadly enough I probably
wouldn't of even believed myself anyways, learning my life's hard
lessons through the experiences I continued to suffer.
I went to work at Mar-A Lago that day trying hard not to think of what
lay ahead in the afternoon too come, but the later the hour got the more
distinguished the knots became in my stomach. I spoke to no one of the
dea note micexpli studying ev but eld rapy it hotel is so friend was
surprised and intrigued that these people who could afford the best of the
best of therapists in the world chose an untrained fifteen-year-old girl to
perform a massage. She never said it in words, but her body language told
me she knew exactly why they wanted to use me and it wasn't for a
therapeutic reason either and deep down inside I understood
The rest of the afternoon slipped away quickly and before I knew it I
was standing before those large wooden doors again, giving a moments
pause but long enough to draw in my breath and exhale some of the
anxiety before ringing the doorbell. Juan answered the door again and
told me Ghislane would be down in a few moments and asked to follow
him into the kitchen. There was a pleasant looking young girl with blonde
spirals in her hair that glanced up from the mound of paperwork before
her. Her shocking blue eye's and appealing English accent seemed
delightful and she introduced herself as "Emmy", Ghislane's Personal
Assistant. I introduced myself as "Jenna" which is what most people
knew me as and told her I was on an employment trial to become
Jeffrey's massage therapist. She had a coy smile on her face that told me
she knew exactly what i was on trial for. Something in my gut told me

this wasn't the first time a young girl had been trialed for the same
position I was about to fill.
We were only chatting for a moment before Ghislane appeared and told
me Jeffrey was ready for his massage. I was led through the extensively
large house to the winding staircase that would lead me up to the same
dreaded room where I would have to re-enact last night's performance. I
wasn't far from wrong. I gave Jeffrey a massage with Ghislane leading
the way again, this time we surprisingly made it to the front of his body
and she continued to show me how to massage all the way up to his
stomach pushing my hands in a spiraling clockwise circular motion to not
disrupt the bowels and then we came up to his chest. He couldn't dare
contain himself for one second longer, telling me to put my lips on his
nipples and give them a kiss. Jeffrey moaned in pleasure and Ghislane
started to undress me from behind. Within moments I was completely
naked and Ghislane had her top off. She was caressing my body with her
hands while Jeffrey moved his hands down to stroke his loins while he
watched her and I kiss and touch each other. I didn't know if she was
doing this for the sake of his eye-candy but she sure did act like she loved
having the control over me telling me what to do throughout the entire
threesome. Jeffrey's climax was always the end to our sessions and this
time he wanted to have me make him orgasm orally. Afterwards we went
for the ritualistic steam-room, this time Ghislane joining in with us for
conversation. She asked me to massage her feet this time while we were
in the steam room, showing me that Jeffrey wasn't the only one I had pay
my homage to. We all had a shower next and then we all went downstairs
to pay me and have Juan drop me off back home.
The following afternoon I received a call at work, surprisingly it was
Ghislane asking me to come over when I got off of work again. The
compliant side took over and I told her I looked forward to meeting with
them today, instead of telling her to go screw herself for lying to me and
making me degrade myself more each time I saw them. I finished work
for the day and my Dad brought me over to El Brillo Way again, where
the vultures were patiently waiting in their lair, he wished me well as I
hopped out of his big truck, looking ever so much like his little girl again:
I gave him a smile and a wave as he drove down the long driveway,
waiting for him to suddenly turn back and not leave me alone to my task.
I shook myself out of that calamity and put on my "big girls" face.
Juan brought me to the kitchen again as I waited for Ghislane. He
offered me a cold drink and some fruit on a platter, I accepted and was
grateful for the rejuvenation before I went to work again. It wasn't long
before Ghislane approached me from behind with a cold intense look in
her eye. I jumped from my seat, feeling like maybe I shouldn't have been
eating and drinking while on the job, as her demeanor seemed annoyed
and temperamental in the seconds that she appeared. She told me I would
be on my own today as she had business to attend to, so make sure l
remembered what she had taught me, as my trial depended on it.
Chapter 5
I walked up the stairs by myself this time, taking in more of the décor,
noticing the more I looked around the more I noticed a different girl in
each photograph in his collection of half-nude and topless girls on display
around his mansion. I couldn't believe how many girls there were, it's not
like Jeffrey was much to look at. He was an aging man in his early fifties
with shiny grey hair and characteristic lines drawn down his face as if he
had seen harder days. With no prospects of ever settling down or having a
family of his own, Jeffrey treated us girls like a piece of clothing he could
try on for the day and get rid of the next. So why was there so many girls
in these photo's? I wondered to myself if I would end up one of those
girls among his collection of forgotten relationships and broken promises.
I continued to make my way up the stairs, and as if all of my senses
were heightened from my bare nerves being exposed, I could smell the
cleaning detergents recently used by the housekeepers, my observations
of the shade of lighting through the concealed blinds as I entered Jeffrey's
bedroom appeared golden, and the sound of stillness except for the thud
of my rapid beating heart all made me more aware of how nervous I was
to be on my own. Not that Ghislane was anything of a comfort, but I
didn't know what to expect or how I was going to lead myself into
upholding my obligation in pleasing him. I would hope for the best I
thought, trying to uplift my confidence as I opened the door to the
massage room with the typical scene of Jeffrey laying naked facedown in
the massage bed waiting for his entertainment. It was de'ja' vous' all over
again. Repeating what Ghislane had taught me, with him commenting on
what else I should be doing, until it got to the end and I was expected to

had to ask him for my pay. He went to Jeffrey's desk and took out the
exact amount 1 was owed without even asking how much I normally get
paid. He then drove me home, only to be back the next afternoon.

The following week was a daily routine, providing Jeffrey with
massages and continuously being groomed to fulfill all his needs. Often
joined by Ms. Maxwell and her assistant Emmy for sexual trysts of all
kinds. I was mentally and physically exhausted from the week of working
and having to keep up with Jeffrey's strenuous late night activities. I
couldn't believe what I was doing but it was all starting to sink in fast.
Most nights when I got home, l'd briefly say "Hi" to Mom and Dad
before heading straight to my bedroom. I couldn't even sleep well
anymore. Closing my eyes at night I would fight the inevitable flood of
thoughts, replaying the moments of shame that ate away myself piece by
piece. My only reasoning being I just had to keep telling myself it would
This afternoon Ghislane appeared to be in a much better mood. Instead
of taking me straight up to Jeffrey she took me to a yellow guest room
where Emmy mostly stayed. It had a balcony where Emmy was already
outside reading a magazine and puffing on a cigarette. Ghislane lit one up
too and then offered me one. I hadn't smoked cigarettes much before,
besides trying to look cool in front of one of my friends, but never really
took to them, so when I started to cough from the inhalation of smoke,
the girls began to laugh and joke about my in-experience. It was an
icer kar or alone to la road raker lean me per nante
smoker than an old lady with a raspy smokers cough. I don't think
ker, as vong ass to was abid to have ie bask say. her she seemed tes
and she liked that I wouldn't cross those invisible lines. All three of us
chatted like friends and it started to feel like some kind of a strange
relationship was budding. After about fifteen minutes of chatting away,
Ghislane instructed me to wash my hands thoroughly, as Jeffrey hated the
smell of smokers, and to follow her down the hallway to the massage
room where he'll be expecting me shortly. I did what she asked and
sprayed myself with the body spray that I always carried in my purse and
headed down the hall to Jeffrey's room.
When I opened the door to the massage room surprisingly it was empty.
I sat down on the already made up massage table and was careful not to
mess up the neatly folded towels on the end of the bed. It was a good
fifteen more minutes before Jeffrey made his appearance. It was strange
seeing him in clothes for the first time. He wasn't wearing what you'd
expect your typical billionaire's attire to be. He was wearing a pair of
sweatpants and a Harvard sweatshirt, which he began to remove
immediately. This time he wanted to commence our session in the steam
room, so 1 began to undress as well. We went into the steam room and he
pushed a few buttons and the steam began to pour in from the marble
wall's built in jets. There was a bench coming out of the wall also made
out of marble that went from either side of the room and had a step
underneath it where I was instructed to sit on so that I could begin giving
Jeffery his massage. Our conversation started off about simple things like
how was your day at work, and I asked Jeffrey how his day was lounging
around, just being polite to each other. He was acting out of character
being a lot more attentive and conversing with me about other things than
sex or massages for once. Starting with his heels, ankles, toes and arches
in the soles of his feet I massaged all the way up to his calves. It took a
lot more strength to massage in the steam room without oils or lotions
and the constant blowing of steam in your face making me twice as
exerted. I was beginning to really start to heat up when the door to the
room suddenly opened to reveal two naked women. Ghislane and Emmy
acted as if they came in to join us for a steam bath, but my instincts were
telling me otherwise. At least the cold burst of air and escaped steam
revived me a bit.
So there was Jeffrey and Ghislane sitting on top of this marble bench,
each with a young girl at their feet. Emmy and I continued with the
massage until they were ready to head into the shower. There were two
showerheads that Ghislane and Jeffrey both stood under while they were
being lathered with soap bubbles as we washed their bodies. After the
shower Ghislane led us into Jeffrey's bed to finish today's session with
Emmy, Ghislane and I performing lesbian acts of foreplay on each other
while Jeffrey laid back and watched. Stroking his manhood in much
delight, he brought himself to climax, and the session was over within
moments. We all got dressed and went downstairs to the kitchen for some
refreshments. Like nothing had happened at all, it was all so bizarre for
me, the whole ordeal with them since this all began. I couldn't understand
why Ghislane and Jeffrey had such an openly intimate relationship but
peculiar taste and he supplies the lavish lifestyle she was accustomed too

types of people. Their friendships and partnerships can change like the
I went home that night still confused on how I could let myself sink so
low, I had to put on an act like I enjoyed submitting my body and being
their new subservient plaything all for the fact that I was making
anywhere between $200-$400 for just a couple of hours. Then spent the
rest of the night regressing on the entire event in my head over and over
again. I battled those thoughts with the hope that I was receiving a
profession out of this and making good money in the meantime. All I had
to do was keep lying to myself long enough until I eventually believed it.
Arriving at Jeffrey's on time the next afternoon, as I always did,
understanding punctuality was a sign of respect and I wanted them to feel
as if they had my deepest appreciation for the once in a lifetime chance
they had given to a girl of my history. This time when Juan answered the
door he told me Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell were waiting for me
upstairs in the massage room. I began my hike up the familiar spiraling
staircase and through to the room where my arrival was being deeply
anticipated. They were already in the steam room awaiting me to join
them. I undressed out of my uniform and folded them in a neat pile,
which I placed upon the marble basin. Having one last look in the mirror
before I exhaling a deep breath as if I was plunging into deep water, I
knew today was a big day. I either accepted their offer and trade my
morals for opportunity, or walk away with the prospect of one day many
years from now trying to make it on my own which I knew endowed
So confused about what decision to make, I just opened the door to the
steam room and let them do the talking. Used to the routine by now I sat
below Jeffrey and began to massage his feet and legs as I listened in on
their ongoing conversation about travel plans for the next few weeks.
Ghislane and Jeffrey turned their attention to me and he asked me how
would I like to go see the big city of Manhattan. I told them I had never
visited New York before and it sounded like an adventure but my job at
Mar-A-Lago was only a summer job and wouldn't be able to get the time
off, especially that summer was so busy anyways.
Jeffrey then made his announcement, that I should just quit my job at
Mar-a-Lago and become his permanent travelling masseuse. He then
further persuaded me with all of the luxuries that came along with my
acceptance. Rather than being paid $9 dollars per hour at my current job I
could be earning $200 dollars per massage, which he even said could be a
few times a day. Tomorrow we could be leaving Palm Beach together in
his private jet first heading to his residence in the upper east side of
Manhattan, also the largest mansion in N.Y, and would next be setting off
to the Caribbean, where he owned a secluded island just past Little St.
James for a bit of relaxation. The temptation of his grandeur offer wasn't
hard to give into, my vulnerability to be lewd into his grasp seemed
comforting at the time. The idea that females were nothing more than an
empty shell of beauty bound by only a body to offer was a notion I had
accepted a long time ago with my first teacher, Ron.
My reaction had to be more than amusing for their egos, even though I
was excited to be traveling I could only imagine the likeliness of having
to be at their beckon call as well. In my head I just told myself we all do
what we have to do in our lives to succeed no matter what it takes, and
with no one knowing the truth, I had no one to talk me out of it. I
accepted his offer and knew from here on out I would be his servant to
his sexual desires until one day I would gain my credentials and only then
could I go out on my own and make it in this world that when so young
seems so unconquerable. The night advanced into the usual grooming of
his requirements, for the next hour and a half being exploited to satisfy
My mom cornered me that night, before I had a chance to avoid
speaking to anyone, heading to the shower then my bedroom, like I had
been the last week. She knocked at my door with a hostile look in her
eyes, " Virginia, what exactly does an older couple want with a fifteen
year old girl, who has no credentials and with no experience in massage
therapy?" She used that stern tone of voice that she's always had, when I
was in trouble.
Thus, as impressionable as I was, my blue eyes batted their innocence
in her direction and I flashed her a girlish grin selling her the pitch that I
had been given earlier that night. Not mentioning the other side to the
glamorous lifestyle I would soon be living in. I told her about the money
I'd be earning, the places l'd be seeing, the people I could meet and most
of all the trade l'd be learning. It all sounded so good, except it was a
bunch of lies I had to tell her and myself to otherwise convince us, that
this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to take it.
She asked when all of this would start, and I as shocking as it was to me
too, I told her I had to go start packing. We were leaving the next
morning off to N.Y.C. At fifteen most girls would be sucking up to their
parents to go to a high-school dance or to go on a date to the movies with
a nervous chap, but I wasn't even asking her. I was simply letting her
know that I would be away for the next couple weeks, maybe three and
would keep in contact when i got free time. Her daughter was lost a long
time ago, and she just now realized it. Backing out of the bathroom, with
nothing she could say, she left me wondering to myself who I was

he'd take care of it for me. We said our good-byes outside in the
driveway, Jeffrey even coming outside to meet with my father to shake
his hands and assure him that his daughter will be more than looked after.
I hugged my dad tightly, feeling like i was on the verge of a steep cliff,
when he let go, so did the last of my innocence.
Juan drove Jeffrey, Ghislane and I to Palm Beaches' Private Airport
and the luggage handlers escorted us on the tar mat where we all boarded
on Jaffrey's black jet. Larry was his main pilot, he had shiny grey hair
and long lanky legs, but a very sincere smile that instantly made you feel
at ease. He greeted us at the staircase that led into the main cabin. It was
as lavish as I imagined it would be. The seats were enveloped in the finest
beige leather with polished wood grain finishes and there was a kitchen in
the back with an adjoining toilet. Jeffrey saw the amazement in my eyes
and to make it more thrilling he brought me up to the cockpit and let me
watch with a bird's eye view of the take off. I was on a natural high when
I came back to the cabin and was instantly brought back down when
Jeffrey rested his bare feet on top of the reclined seat and instructed me to
get to work and start massaging him. My future was in his hands now, so
when he wanted something, I wouldn't hesitate in giving it to him.
Chapter 6
Upon our arrival at New Jersey's Private Airstrip, the driver Jo-Jo met
us. His name was most likely shortened for something of his oriental
decent. Jeffrey liked to shorten the names of his multi-cultural staff into
American names. Even Juan and Maria were known as John and Mary.
We arrived in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His principal place of
residence was the largest home in Manhattan, eight stories of opulence. It
used to be a Private School for boy's many years ago, until Les Wexner,
Jeffrey's best friend and mentor bought it for him as a mysterious gift.
There were two large Chinese gargoyles outside the entrance, and
beside the heavy looking wooden doors there was an intercom with a
camera overlooking us. I walked up the concrete steps into a realm of
wealth, glamour and most of all influence. My eye's glistened at the
splendor of his palace. Caramel colored marble tiles spread through the
first floor, where his gourmet kitchen and dining hall were also located.
Then I came to this sweeping staircase that curved into the next level
where Jeffrey and I went into his office, even though it looked more like
a museum exhibit. Ancient draperies that told lascivious stories of their
own covered parts of the elevated walls, and the remaining wall spaces
were taken up by rows on top of rows of books. He loved to read, as he
often found it hard to sleep and was comforted in the early morning hours
with his literature, or sometimes in other ways I would come to find out.
There was a mantle piece and a sofa with two armchairs next to the grand
piano that flaunted more of Jeffrey's beautiful conquests, young women
posing in salacious pictures, suggesting I could be easily replaced next to
one of those girls if I failed in keeping him satisfied. There were also
some pictures with recognizable political and royal figures either shaking
Jeffrey's hand, or with an arm around each other, even one with Jeffrey
and the Dali Lama, although his church was the bank. He liked to use his
power, wealth, and money to manipulate everyone in his life.
He made a phone call that sounded business like and I didn't mind, I
was quite enjoying taking in all of the beauty around me, I was blinded
by all of it. I was still waiting for him when, Ghislane came in. She asked
me what I thought so far of my trip to N.Y.C, I knew she was talking
about the house, she loved to gloat, even though none of it actually
belonged to her, she wanted everyone to believe that it did. I
complimented her on the mid-evil looking tapestries and a few other
adornments, when she cut me off mid-sentence to compliment it herself,
telling me the history about one of the 17" century tapestry's which to an
unsophisticated eye, looked to me like a rug on the wall.
Jeffrey hung the phone up and walked over to the sofa where we were
sitting next to the mantle piece and took a seat on one of the armchairs.
He didn't seem worried from the phone call but his mind was definitely
somewhere else from the hard look on his face. We all spoke for a few
moments more about the splendid décor before Jeffrey had enough small
talk and needed some of his own relaxation time. He told Ghislane he
was going to show me to the massage room and he'd be back in a couple
hours. She agreed he looked like he could use some time to unwind and
with that wry grin of hers, she gave me a look that told me precisely how
he was expecting to be relaxed.
We left his office all together, Ghislane going downstairs, and Jeffrey
showing me to the lifts. The lift looked like it's original that came with
the school. It was made out of brass antique with archaic cuts throughout
the arches at the top. It wasn't the only lift in the house, but certainly the
most beautiful. We walked down a long hall carpeted in a royal red and
golden trim, passing by a bronze pagan statue of the horny little goat God
"Pan". How adequate, I thought, fit Jeffrey to a tee. We walked into this
dimly lit room. Another daunting chamber that looked like we had
stepped back in time to the dark ages. It took a second for my eyes to
adjust to the darkness, and Jeffrey beckoned me to follow him through
the room to the open adjoin shower, toilet and steam room. The room was
in black marble to accent the dreariness, and smaller than the one in Palm

Beach, but it had it's own witchery feel to it. Another unseen side to this
Man I was coming to know.
We both undressed and I followed Jeffrey into the steam room first. He
loved feeling clean, teaching me that the steam would deplete the toxins
from your skin, which was great during a massage when your blood flow
is being replenished. I grabbed his foot out of instinct, knowing I had to
be constantly on alert to keep this man satisfied. He looked down at me
with a nod and reclined back against the wall as the steam pored in, this
was his idea of alleviation. I worked up to his calves and within a few
more minutes, he said he was ready for his massage on the bed. We got
out and towel dried off, both still nude, he asked me to stay undressed,
then we headed to massage bed in the middle of the room. He lay down
on the bed and told me to turn on the CD player on the wall hutch, where
all of the oils and lotions were set out, I hit play and a collection of mixed
classical symphonies began to fill the silence. I could tell he wasn't in
one of those moods to be uplifted with idle chat, so I remained silent,
letting him enjoy my slow movements, making my way up his body. My
instincts told me I was right about his mood, as he seemed to appreciate
the quietness of moment and the leisurely of the strokes I was using to
massage him. When I got to his scalp he turned over, and grabbed my
hand to put on his erect manhood. No words spoken yet, I took the
gesture and initiated what 1 had been taught over the last week. While
pleasing my master his hands groped my young flesh, penetrating my
insides with his fingers, he was only concerned with what he wanted, as
1l ves is so moans were sor rand he loudesicares of breath and
my job was done. No intimate kisses, or sweet pillow talk. He showed his
appreciation with money, never attachment. We concluded with a shower
and he told me he had some business to conduct. He walked me to the lift
and told me go to the next level and my room was the first one on the
right, it had an intercom in which he can contact me when needed.
I hit number 5 on the lift and took his directions to my room. I opened
the door to this massive loft, the size of an adequate house. I walked
down the long hall and my eves took in the magnificence of my
surroundings. It was a room fit for royalty, and later would find out had
been stayed in by some. The room was trimmed in gold paint and had
another eerie tapestry on the main wall as feature. There was a T.V and a
huge king sized bed, with goose feathered comforter and pillows.
All of the glitter from Jeffrey's lifestyle he was offering me finally
covered the last bit of sight I had left and I let go of my consciousness.
Excited by my enthralling day, not having anyone around to have to act
reserved, I jumped into the soft bed and lay looking around, thinking
about how quick life could change based upon one swift decision. Dazing
into the artistry, the intercom buzzed on the telephone next to the bed and
it was a housemaid letting me know Jeffrey wanted to see me in his office
now. "Already" I thought to myself, I was just getting settled in. I was
worried I was going to get lost in this ancient museum, but I got myself
back to his office with no trouble, it was kind of hard to miss. I knocked
at the slightly ajar door and Jeffrey called for me to enter. I walked over
to his desk, where he was just ending a phone call and he opened his
duffel bag full of money. "T'll be out at my other office for most of the
day, so instead of being locked inside I thought you should go do some
sightseeing for the day since it is your first trip to the Big Apple" He
didn't count how much he was giving me he just handed me a bundle out
of the banded $100 dollar bills. He knew just how pull the right strings,
making me squeal in delight and give him a kiss in the cheek, since we
were never really emotionally intimate, it would be odd to act in any
other way, but he seemed to like it.
I ran upstairs to get dressed for "City" shopping and put my make-up
on, then hit the streets of N. Y.C, looking for a place to start spending this
load of dosh. When I got to the end of 72"d street on 5th Avenue, I had no
idea which way to turn, left or right. I thought I'd just follow the lights
past Central Park and see the local sights on my way. My eyes were once
again peeled back in splendor. I had never imagined a place so busy with
the hustle and bustle of all the walks of life. My first stop was to buy a
disposable camera and I was off taking photos of every wonder that
caught my attention. I didn't do much shopping as I had planned too; I
was having too much fun exploring this capacious metropolitan.
When it started to hit dusk I began walking back to Jeffrey's but not
before stopping off to enjoy a giant slice of pepperoni pizza, it was the
best 1 had ever had, and considering I was going back to Jeffrey's
chickpea and tofu salad's or such. I really hated the healthy cuisine
served by Jeffrey's personal chef. I was a naturally skinny girl, never
watching what I ate and to eat that food I might as well have chewed on
hay. I strolled back to Jeffrey's and was missed. Ghislane scolded me
"You shouldn't have been gone so long young lady", «We need to know
where you are at all times, you are on call for Jeffrey" I started to
apologize, feeling guilty, I didn't want them to think I didn't take my job
with them seriously. She cut off my explanation with a short conclusion
to this conversation "We will get you a cell phone tomorrow, so we can
always find you". I thanked her for her generosity, and she dismissed me
to my room. So I wasn't even needed after all, it was just a way for her to
place me deeper in their control. The next few days I was on call, as
Ghislane said I'd be. Venturing out to the city for only an hour or so at a
time, I looked most forward to my outings. I would return to Jeffrey's

mansion to attend to his sexual desires and when he was finished with
me, I'd be off to my adventures.
On the day before we were to be heading back to Palm Beach, Jeffrey
had a new proposition for me. I could make double the money I was
making, if I would look for pretty girls and convince them to come back
to Jeffrey's to be further persuaded with money to engage in bi-sexual
and sexual acts with Jeffrey and I. I asked him how does one actually
propose such a thing to a complete stranger? "Well" he said in a build up
to another kind of lesson. "If I were you I would use your charm to entice
them and my money to bring them, I would tell them you work for a
multi-billionaire who has a taste for young, beautiful girls and with his
contacts in the acting, modeling, or rich husband world, your boss could
help them. All they have to do is come meet me first." If I wasn't so
naïve at the time I would've seen that's exactly what he was doing with
me, my prospects were massage credentials, but with too much pain from
my past, I could only have hope. Not that I was a shy girl, but picking up
girls for one reason alone, only to be endorsed for her body, didn't sound
like something I could do. But not wanting to displease my master, I told
him that I would give it a go. You could tell he was instantly excited with
my agreement, he started to reveal the politics of what kind of girls he
was looking for. He wasn't into multi-cultural girls, a very chauvinistic
perception; he said they had to be uniquely gorgeous to be accepted by
him, but definitely no African-American girls, he was racist against
anything different to his kind, a very narrow minded way of thinking for
such a supposed brilliant man. The list went on and on. No girls with
tattoo's or piercing's, or gothics, no drug users, or prostitutes. Basically
he wanted everyone's daughter that looked like the girl next door, with
blue eyes and blonde curly ringlets. I just nodded and smiled, wanting
this to be over with and move on to another conversation, but so worked
up from our previous talk, instead he persisted to show me exactly what I
was good for to him. He took me up to the highest loft in his large
mansion and he lay down on his large bed, expecting me to know exactly
what he wanted done. As always, I complied. Part of me hating him for
having to degrade myself to be so subservient to his sexual whims, and
another part of me was telling myself to be grateful for the opportunities I
was being given.
The battles in my head were beginning to cause me too much anxiety.
when we got back to Palm Beach, I asked my Mom to make me a
doctor's apointment for some headaches I had been getting lately, so she
wouldn't question me. I walked out of the doctor's with a prescription for
a mind-altering anxiety tablet called "Xanax", not only did it help with
anxiety but it also acted as blanket over terrible memories. So when I had
to perform degrading acts, I would take a few pills and forget what
happened within the next hour and be able to become someone without a
battling conscious.
I spent my sweet 16" birthday on his island in the Caribbean next to
"St. James Isle" he liked to call it "Little St. Jeff's", his ego was as
enormous as his appetite for fornicating. I was given a birthday cake and
a new collection of designer make-up from London. Ghislane made a
joke after I blew out my array of candles and said, "I'd be soon getting
too old for Jeffrey's taste, and soon they'd have to trade me in." She was
only half joking in a sad reality though. A few days after my birthday, a

named Sarah. She had long ash blonde hair and big brown eyes that
hinted she had a cheeky nature. She had known Jeffrey before I had, and
he was supposedly trying to help her get an acting job in L.A. She was
obviously accustomed to the lifestyle he provided her, making it ever so
hingen stiper pe and attaro she lace shed on hi poli, aung him
for sex. She was good at what she did, even putting me at ease with her
cool persona and funny jokes. Jeffrey told me privately that she was one
of his best at procuring young girls into her entrapment and delivering
them to him when he was in town, and when it came to time in the private
chambers with Jeffrey, Her and I, it wasn't hard to comprehend. She was
devoted to the moment, giving Jeffrey every imaginable lustful desire he
could fathom. On the last night there we all took a trip over to St. James
to go for a stroll, odd I thought, it was past 7pm and Jeffrey rarely strayed
out past then, unless it was some event or dinner party. While Ghislane
and him looked the average couple strolling arm in arm through the
streets, he said to Sarah and I, "Why don't you two hit the night club here
and see if there is anyone interesting to bring back for the evening?" It
was more of an order than a request and then I knew why we came out
tonight and why Sarah was invited, tonight was all about training, and
Sarah was going to show me the ropes in picking up girls. Although there
was no one to accustom to Jeffrey's distinct taste to bring back, watching
Sarah flirt from girl to girl like a floating butterfly, gave me enough
insight into what I was expected to do.
Within Months I had become his handy little helper. Not only would I
run to his beckon call, but I also aided Ghislane in bringing in more girls
to keep the appetite of our sexually starving chief from going hungry. I
once asked Ghislane, why she did what she did for hini, instead of having
a common monogamous relationship and getting jealous like normal
tree, and not even someone like her could escape from its lure.

Just like Ghislane had trained me it was now my job to reiterate that
onto other girls and thus the cycle of girls trying to climb the chain of
hierarchy would start all over each time I brought a new one in. The
sessions rarely differed much. They would mostly start out with Jeffrey
on top of the massage table already naked and me leading a girl into
massaging him until his instructions came to remove our clothing and if
they agreed to that, then Jeffrey knew he had them in his pocket, and
could do what ever else he wanted. He was never turned down in the
many years I stayed with him. Never being shy, he would tell us to start
kissing each other or depending on what he wanted we would perform
erotic acts sometimes with him fondling us, or just masturbating while he
watched. On explicit occasions, sex toys would be used on us girls,
making it all the more exciting for him to observe. Ending with a
payment of $200 for the new girl and $400 to me for bringing her. He
would then wait for us to leave before adding the events details of names
and payments in a little black diary he kept with him wherever he went,
so if he were in anyone of the city's he lived in, he would always have
contacts for sex.
I was slowly climbing the ladder, as Jeffrey was happy taking me
everywhere with him, within the States. Merely at home I distanced
myself from my Family altogether and with Jeffrey renting me an
apartment in Royal Palm Beach as well as a plush furnished apartment in
N.Y.C, there was hardly a need to see them. I just couldn't face everyone
thinking they all knew what I was really doing travelling around with a
man old enough to be my grandfather who supposedly only wanted me
for massages. Much further convincing myself of the lies I told myself, I•
took a liking to the Xanax, it felt like it was all a dream at times, even
meeting up with old contacts from school years who experimented with
drugs. I was flying around the country, seeing so many places in America
I had only heard about in Movies and making more money than anyone
my age and loving it. My friends didn't believe the lies I told them about
only being a massage therapist, some of them even asking if they can
meet Jeffrey too. At this point in my life my heart went missing for a
while and I stooped so low, I was even bringing my friends, I just saw
them as easy commission. When I wasn't playing servant to my master, I
was partying hard, eventually using ecstasy pills, acid, and marijuana to
disillusion the times I would've had away from Jeffrey to think about
what 1 was actually doing with my life. I realized something one day
while I was alone, although I had Jeffrey to attend to sexually, it was not
gratifying. I needed someone to come home to, someone I could call my
boyfriend and that showed me emotion not just a job to get done.
Chapter 7
A knock came to my apartment door one lazy afternoon while we were
in Palm Beach. I looked through the peephole and didn't recognize the
once familiar face. I asked from behind the closed door "Who is it"? The
voice of the reply was one I wasn't anticipating to ever hear again. It was
my Junior-High crush and childhood friend, T.J. The last time I saw him I
was a runaway and he had let me stay at his house for a few days, telling
his parents nothing, he kept me hidden away in his room. At nightfall he
said to knock on his window and I could jump through and stay the night.
Until I was picked up by authorities during school hours and questioned
why I wasn't in school they did some resourcing finding out I was a
runaway, then delivered me back to my angry parents.
"Oh My God- You finally answer your door girl", and in a whirlwind,
T.J stormed back into my life. Even moving into my apartment, secretly,
within two weeks of his arrival. He had changed so much from the last
time I had seen him. He used to be this hard looking rocker type, now he
was cleaned up wearing preppy clothes and shooting out Tupac Lyrics.
He had the same old big brown eyes though, and when he told me he had
heard I was back in town but he was unable to ever get ahold of me he
just kept knocking at my door every so often, I was sold. How sweet I
thought, he must care about me if he was so intent on approaching me,
not even thinking he would've spoken to the girls from our junior-high
circle and they would've mentioned him I was back in town, what I was
doing and where to find me. We were a drug-induced romance, which
budded from fake emotions the affects made us feel. He got what he
wanted, a free ride and not having to work, and I got what I deserved, a
man who could let me go away with this multi-billionaire I regarded as
my second boyfriend
I didn't want to alarm Jeffrey in me having a boyfriend so I kept it
quiet, until during a massage I was giving to him one afternoon. We were
having a conversation about some of my friends, the party girls I had
brought in to meet him. Jeffrey started asking questions about the
different types of drugs they used hearing them speak about it in his
presence. "I thought a person on drugs would be all strung out and
looking like hell, but the girls you know look great" he stated face down
during the massage.
That's when I told him I had been dabbling in ecstasy lately too, and I
thought it was the most amazing feeling one could even fathom. I tried to
describe the euphoric feelings it gave me and even joked with him about
wanting to pet anything furry that was around and then there was the
constant need to flick my tongue-ring around my mouth. It was great

having such an open conversation about things Jeffrey had never
experienced before and he seemed okay with everything I was telling him
as we were having a good laugh together, so I thought I could push it a bit
further and tell him the truth about T.J. since it was bound to come out
sooner than later I'd rather not the latter, when it would look even worse
that I kept the truth from him for so long.
"Well why were opening up about things together", I continued by
saying "I had met someone from my past and we have been hanging out a
lot lately. When I haven't been travelling with you I have been with him
and I was wondering if you minded if I started to see this guy." He started
to laugh out loud, "Are you serious? Of course not, no one in this world is
monogamous, why would I expect you to be?" I was smitten with relief,
but a little bit dis-heartened when I heard him speak that way and I
wondered to myself if he'd had his own personal encounter with

straddled him on top of the table and let him explode with pleasure inside
of me. Thinking the entire time about T.J, I felt so terrible but I quickly
had to wipe the thoughts of guilt from my mind not to give Jeffrey the
wrong impression. So I had myself busy with two men in my life, but
that's not what I really wanted for myself. I wanted an occupation that
would eventually set me free from depending on a man as my source of
I asked Jeffrey before I left for the evening, when my real training was
going to begin and he liked my assertiveness. I thought it meant to him
that I was taking my job with him seriously, but it was all part of his
master plan to keep me by his side. Within a couple of weeks of my
persistence, Jeffrey introduced me to a couple of real working massage
therapists, not only with credentials but with their own clientele too. I
was in awe of their teachings, it all made so much sense about the body
and what they were saying. I felt like I had picked myself up out of the
lurches and had a direction again.
I was in the middle of another training session, with Jeffrey the
recipient as usual, being it was rare for Ghislane to ask for a massage
unless of course it was for Jeffrey's own pleasure to watch the punch line
of the session, when I was shocked to hear Jeffrey ask one of the
therapists to now remove her shirt. He had no shame I thought. Even
something out of a role-playing porn scene with the therapist removing
her white uniform to reveal her beautiful nude body and a much darker
side to her personality.
I couldn't believe it at first it was such a state of shock and I began to
question t myself if this was normal in the massage profession to expect
this kind of clientele to request such degrading tasks even though they
were professionals. At the end of the session she was paid $300 dollars an
additional hundred for helping to train me as well, and I was paid my
usual $200 dollars then we were both invited by Jeffrey to join him out
by the pool for a cool dip. With Jeffrey making a few phone calls while
her and I undressed again for a swim, I wanted to ask her a few personal
questions about what she's come to learn about the Massage Therapy
game, but I never got the chance as we were joined by Ghislane moments
later. She was asking how my training was going and booked the
therapist in for herself in the following morning. Where she was invited
back to do another training session with me. It didn't take me long to
figure out why.
I was at my apartment when I received a phone call from Jeffrey, I
thought it was the usual call to come over to his house, but he surprised
me. Instead I would be going to the exclusive hotel in Palm Beach
tonight, The Breaker's, where I would be meeting my first ever clients.
Only told their first names I was given some instructions and the address
where to meet Glen and Eva. They were a married couple with one on the
way. I was quite concerned when I heard she was pregnant, being I really
didn't know the body that well and didn't want to inflict any wrong doing
on the unborn baby but Jeffrey insisted I take this job. Just massage her
gently where she wants to be rubbed and to save all of my energy for
Glen's massage, since it was going to be a four-hour job. In an
emphasized tone of voice I was being coached by Jeffrey to treat Glen
with exactly whatever he wanted, just like I do for Jeffrey himself. It was
my last bit of preparation before he sent me out to his friends and my first
taste of responsibility in upholding his reputation.
At around seven pm I took a taxi to the address I was given and found
them on the residential side of the giant hotel's extensive property. When
I arrived in their apartment it was a far cry from the lavish place I was
expecting, still really nice but had a cozier family feel to it. It was iust
beginning to get dark when Eva and I went into the Master Bedroom and
she undressed to reveal the first naked pregnant body I had ever seen. It
was fascinating to see her in the later stages of maternity, and strangely
enough it was a miraculous and wondrous sight. She was a former model
and one of Jeffrey's many entourages from his past that had gotten to old
for his taste and was married off to a wealthy colleague of his.
Lying down on the bed I adjusted the pillows to try and make her more
comfortable and I began to massage her as Jeffrey had instructed me to,

softly and slowly. So at ease with her nude body she even asked me to
massage her swelling breasts, in a non- sexual way. Not knowing any
other way but that way, I was trying to oblige in her request doing the
very best I could to relieve her but couldn't help but giggle to myself at
the very sight of this. She said she was very happy at the end of the
massage and rolled over to go to sleep, asking me to turn out the light at
the end of it. I closed the door gently as if not to disturb her, and went to
find my other client.
The apartment's lights had been turned out for the sleeping children and
I found Glen awaiting for me in the lounge room where I had to call out
"Excuse me?" as I couldn't see him in the dark. There was a throw rug on
the ground that he had already placed out as he began to strip down in
preparation of the massage. Lying frontwards facing me with his exposed
and ever growing manhood, I asked him to roll over to begin the
massage. He complied with a cheeky smile and from his eagerness to
show he was not shy indeed, I already knew where this was going to end
I found it much more strenuous to massage on the floor but I wouldn't
let that hold me back I wanted to have a career and this being my first
ever clients, I didn't want them to disapprove. Nearly four hours after I
had gotten there I was still hard at work. Mentally preparing for the end
of the session he let me know when he was ready to begin the other side
to my iob and just like Jeffrey did the first time, he requested me to take
off my clothes starting with my shirt. When I complied, the requests kept
coming in and before I could change my mind and run away, I was
having intercourse with this man that was so comfortable doing all of this
while his pregnant wife and children slept in the room beside us. When
he had climaxed, we both got up and dressed and he paid me a large tip
even though Jeffrey would be the one to actually pay me for my time
spent there. Just like it had all started, it had also ended so quickly and
now that was that. I had to accept what my duties were and now I could
go back to Jeffrey who would be further pleased in my demonstrations to
keep him happy.
I was called the next morning to come over to Jeffrey's mansion that
afternoon for lunch, a swim and of course a massage session. Knowing
all too well they'd be expecting the gory details of last nights events with
my new clientele. I came there at lom as requested and sat down for a
light lunch and a swim. Jeffrey was mostly conducting business from his
offside pool office, but he came to ask ine if everything went well the
confident both my dient siderery bhi han pidased with ma He Bat me
a quick grin, before he headed back to the office, throwing a purple grape
down his throat as he walked away.
Lying out on one of the pool decks blue and white striped lounge beds
I was waiting for Jeffrey to finish his business so I could give him his
massage. He never took too long with his work, unless there was
something wrong and then we would all have to wear his mood but today
he seemed fine though, when we went up the stairs he told me we would
be leaving for his ranch in Santa Fe', New Mexico in the morning and I'd
need to be packed and ready tonight. They loved leaving in the spur of
the moment, Jeffrey once said he checks with his pilot Larry on the best
weather before he heads to a different destination. I enjoyed spending
time at his ranch being it was my favorite of all of his residences. He had
a lavish Mediterranean looking castle on top of a hill that over looked his
extensive 7,500 acres of property. It has an indoor pool, gym, and all the
trimmings of extravagance I could only imagine. I had a great time on the
quad bikes, Sarah and I often got scolded for tipping one over going to
fast or trying to go up a steep hill, but we knew those weren't the things
he cared about, so it wouldn't matter. My favorite of it all was his little
town with it's own fire station and truck, stables full of horses, and little
cottages where the housekeepers and ranch hands lived.
On my own time I would take one of the quad bikes down to the
stables and saddle up on one of his beautiful horses and go for a ride in
the open terrain. It was coming up to the end of a very cold winter and it
still had the snow covered mountaintops and brisk air that I loved to take
in during my many trail rides. I have been an experienced horse rider
since my childhood, and could honestly pinpoint some of the best
memories of my life being on the back of a horse. I acclaimed with thrill
in my voice "Great, ['1l get packed as soon as I get back to my apartment"
he threw in "Pack for a few weeks, as we will also be making a pit stop
to L.A for some business afterwards and then to N.Y.C." I was used to
these round trips with him, it was great as I was saving loads of cash and
about to buy myself my first car.
Jeffrey, Ghislane, Emmy and I all left the following morning, as
planned. Arriving in only a few hours at his awe-inspiring Santa Fe
Palace was always a delight. Still frisk in the air, my petite frame looked
even smaller in these gigantic overcoats. Nonetheless I was looking
forward to spending time out in the fresh clean air and open land. After a
few days of leisurely spending our time on the ranch, we went to the
Indian markets in Albuquerque for a bit of shopping and sight seeing.
galleries. Still a splendid trip though. With me picking up a few nifty
collectables to bring back for my family and knowing how much my
mom loves Indian apparel, I thought it would put me back in her good
books for awhile, I hoped at least. There was some lengthy time to put a

little water under the bridge between my folks and I. With my life
heading in a different direction I didn't see any use in holding on to so
much hate especially that I didn't even have to see them that much.
We got back to "Zorro Ranch", the name Jeffrey chose to call the
massive land he bought to build his fortress on, and Jeffrey told me that
he was looking forward to one of my famous relaxing massages and with
that notion he gave my bags of shopping to one of the many housemaids
who greeted us at the front door and asked her to bring my bags to the
exquisite room I was staying in. We headed straight downstairs just past
the massage room and gym there is an indoor heated pool, shower and
spa. First Jeffrey wanted to warm up in the spa underneath a decorated
ceiling of clouds and blue skies. Starting the massage in the spa I rubbed
his feet while he reclined into the spa's jets. We spoke of the museum and
some of the knick-knacks I had bought and I thanked him for the
turquoise earrings and necklace he had got for me as a gift, joking about
not ever knowing what to get for him, being that he was richest man I'd
ever known. By no far means did we ever have any kind of a mutual
respectful bond between us, but there was a significant softer side he
began to share with me that was different from how he treated his other
girls. Maybe it was my feet that filled the shoes for that time being, or the
fact my novelty hadn't worn off yet, but what ever it was I was getting
confused from the double-sided life I was leading.
He got up from the spa tub shortly thereafter and asked me to come
wash him in the shower. It was nothing unordinary to me. I was used to
his need to be nurtured and pampered. I performed his request with a
and towel dried him, patting his skin instead of rubbing as previously
instructed. "You know you have a very maternal instinct, you'll make a
fine mother someday", he would constantly acclaim at my gentleness. "I
hope so" I replied, I would love to have my own babies one day, but not
any time soon". Laughing at the very thought of that.
We walked up the steps and through the French doors into the gym's
adjoining massage room. It was smaller room than in his other houses,
placing the emphasis on the large massage bed in the center. I grabbed
another clean towel to keep him warn while I prepared the music, lights,
and oils. He liked me to use mostly lavender or other aromatherapy
scents, which reminded me of woodlands in the spring. Always enjoying
the beginning of the massage, I put my heart and soul into training in my
profession. I could just close my eyes I would see only with my hands the
areas that needed the most work, and even though I wasn't a professional
yet, Jeffrey could feel and told me there wasn't many that could please
him during a massage being untrained. I'm sure now it was just
something he'd say nice to all the giris, but in the time I had known him I
could honestly say it wasn't like him to compliment girls in any other
way than regards to a sexual performance or their looks. I was flattered at
his praise and when the massage was over, so were the sentiments. I was
back to being used for my body and what I could do with it.
With him satisfied and off for a nap, I could go do what ever I wanted,
like usually I would go down to the stables or something adventurous, but
today I was in a melancholy mood, just wanting to relax and unwind
myself in a giant tub in my bathroom. I got out some of the oils I used on
Jeffrey putting them in the steaming water and popped two of my Xanax
pills, forgetting about my troubles and focusing on the quiet moment at
hand, just wanting to soak up the peacefulness of it. Nearly slipping away
to sleep in the tub, I was startled when I got the call on the intercom to
come down for dinner.
Everybody seemed in good spirits at dinner, which helped to lift mine.
We all ate our meals and went into the movie room to watch a newly
released movie. It was a ritualistic scenario, most nights that everyone
was at ease we would all sit in one of his various located movie rooms
and hang out together. Just as he always would Jeffrey asked Emmy and
me to both grab a foot during the movie that night and just keep
massaging through the film. We were always on call for duty, no matter
where we were or what ever time it was. He would just plop a foot up or
pass over his hand at any given time and require a massage, even if the
film went on for over two hours, I would still be required to sit on the
floor rubbing his feet or hands, and even his scalp at times. After the
credits had rolled Ghislane got up to close the door to the room and I
knew she had received the signals herself and would proceed to
manipulate, violate, and use us to satisfy Jeffrey's urges once more before
he went to bed.
The blue illumination from the empty T.V screen was glaring in the
tenebrous room as we watched her undress in a light that relied on the
reflection of the moon through the windows peek to show it's proceeding
display. She walked back to the sofa where I was sitting at Jeffrey's feet
still rubbing away and uncovered her shirt displaying ample bosoms for
his appeal. Approaching me like a lioness hunting her prey she stood me
up and led me to the other couch across from Jeffrey and situated herself
on top of me, sliding her fingers through my dress to unbutton my attire,
revealing my girlish figure and two small peaks. Pushing my head into
her breasts I was being fondled by Emmy at the same time, which took
her cue when she saw Ghislane look in my direction. From an occasional
glance upwards, I could see that Jeffrey was up to his methodical foreplay
stroking his manhood while watching the build up to his main event.
They both took turns making me moan from their touches and when

Ghislane was ready too she would insinuate we do the same to her. She
urged me downwards, until my head was between her opened legs and
giving into her wanton indulgence. Twenty minutes passed before Jeffrey
exerted his last energies for the night, the only advantage of being with an
old man was they could never last long.
Departing to our own separate quarters for the night, I called T.J for
condolence. It was so important for me to feel like I had someone out
there who saw me as more than a pretty girl with vulnerabilities. I needed
to maintain some sort of a connection to my youthful side. But it would
be to no avail as I was getting used to being badly disappointed by all the
Chapter 8
The phone nearly rang out and as I was about to hang up the receiver
when he finally picked up. On the other end of the phone I could hardly
hear T.J above the background noises. When I asked where he was he
told me "At our place baby", meaning the apartment Jeffrey had rented
for me to be staying in alone. He already sounded off his chops
elongating his words and slurring his speech. There was music pumping
and people shouting behind him and every one sounded like they were
having a great time. I was so sick of his friends coming over using my
house as a place to party and then trashing it so bad I would even have to
sometimes throw my furniture out. I blew up at him over the phone and
threatened to kick him out, back to his parent's house, so much for my
relaxing evening I thought to myself venturing on to tell him "You leech
off me using the money I leave behind for you for drugs and throw these
gigantic parties while I'm away." Also mentioning the disastrous messes
openly eaten, But to " Beer ba did, hal twist could, brig
myself to do so, needing some attachment to my youth through all of this.
"Don't worry baby" he would say attempting to soothe me with his false
words going on to tell me how much he was missing me and how he was
always thinking about me when I was away which was like all the time.
"Cool". The conversation ended with an easy good-bye and no "I-Love-
You's" or anything sweet. We weren't those kinds of partners yet, so
much time spent away from each other and the lifestyles we both led, I
couldn't expect much more from him than what we already had.
Jeffrey and I left two days later, heading off to Carmel in California for
a business trip of his, leaving Ghislane and Emmy to catch a commercial
flight back to N.Y.C, where we would meet up with them later. When we
arrived at the hotel we were given badges for the meeting tomorrow and
settled into our rooms. We got adjoining rooms, keeping the doors open
at all times, but sleeping in different beds. He liked sleeping alone, even
after a late night session I would always go back to my own room. I think
that's why he liked me so much I never put pressure on him to become
intimately more than what we were already, never giving him the
impression I wanted more than what we had. It seemed to keep him
happy just the way we were together. I hung out with Jeffrey that night,
going to a restaurant for dinner and afterwards watching a movie back at
The next morning we went for an early morning breakfast before the
conference and Jeffrey gave me some money to go shopping instead of
attending the all day meeting with him. I was more than obliged to accept
his request, and wished him a good day before planning to meet back in
the room around six pin. He gave me five hundred dollars. He said it was
just enough to go have fun for the day and a girl of my means could find
plenty to do with that kind of money. I walked around the many
boutiques that lined the streets of the picturesque cozy town, and picked
up some bits of clothing here and there and even met a girl who was
passing through on a road trip. She was somewhere in her late teens with
golden sunshine tresses, olive skin and blue eyes. Her name escapes me,
as it was so unexpected, I think it was Tina or something like that but she
was your typical California carefree chic, offering me a few tokes of her
jay as we ducked down a side street together. I was so happy I had met
this girl, as she was fun spirited and charismatic a relief from the social
expectations I had come to know lately, but always being "on-call" as I
had been trained up to be, I ended up inviting her back to meet Jeffrey at
our hotel later on as a surprise for him. Maybe she was just a bit too
carefree for Jeffrey's taste but anyhow she was pretty enough to let him
be the judge of that matter.
Over the next hour of hanging out together I found out that she was on
a road trip with her best friend who was still sleeping off the hard night of
partying from the night before. She was originally from the southern
states as she had a bit of draw still left in her accent, and she had recently
left her boyfriend because he was leaving for a college too far away not
believing in long distance relationships. Then it was my turn to dish out
my contribution to the conversation of getting to know each other better. I
always got anxiety before I would tell a girl what I did for work and
romance (as such), morally I was ashamed of who I was especially with a
girl having led somewhat of a normal life. Next, as always, I expected to

be probed with so many more questions and having to make Jeffrey
sound ideal and hot for the taste of a young girl and knew I would be
point blank lying, so I told her some of the truth which was that he was
really rich and paid good money for a massage and useful to have around
as a contact. I told her he'd give her two hundred dollars for a two-hour
massage with me leading the way and warning her he was known to be
frisky during the session. Unexpectedly she said she could use the money
and then came the part that I hated the most, but had to do so they
wouldn't be as shocked as I was the first time I had met him. "He does
like us to be nude though and sometimes asks for more than just the
massage itself". All I could do was wait for a response after a shocking
sentence like that, and depending on the girl, most were sadly taken back
by the money. Her carefree attitude seemed to disillusion for a moment
when she gave it some thought and asked me "He's not like, fat and ugly,
is he"? ""No...no...not at all" I replied, "He's got more of a Richard
Gere appeal to him". Trying to make him sound a little more measurable
than just a rich old man that likes to be with girls younger than half his
age. "Well then, what time shall we meet tonight"? She asked next.
Great, I thought, Jeffrey would be most pleased with my find. "Knock on
my room quietly, you're going to be a surprise. Be there at around half
past seven tonight and I will introduce you to Jeffrey". She threw the butt
of the second jay we shared in the bushes and we strolled into a
homemade fudge boutique to get some relief for the munchies we now
When I got back to the hotel at around a quarter to six o'clock pm as
ris and dard in my body was bis mys, so nok theting to swould plan
it so the girl would be cleaning off, as Jeffrey liked before he had sexual
contact with a new girl and he could walk in and be surprised to find a
strange beautiful girl in my room who wanted to massage him. Jeffrey
walked through the door not long after I was done prepping for the night
ahead. looking like he had a rough day at the office, which was very rare
for him. He sat down on the bed and I asked him how his day was. He
didn't want to talk much about it, saying it was boring and long, rather
asking what I got up to for the day. Being coy about having a jay and his
unexpected surprise to come, I told him it was a great day of shopping
and sight seeing and I even brought him back some local made fudge
from the shoo that had fulfilled my chocolate cravings only hours ago.
Telling him of the places I ventured into I mentioned to him «We'd
have to hit the fisherman's wharf tomorrow. I saw some locals walking
around with breadbaskets filled with creamy clam chowder and it smelled
absolutely scrumptious." He said if the weather were nice we'd check it
out tomorrow before we left for L.A. He wanted to take off his jeans and
collared shirt and put on his normal attire of sweatpants and a sweatshirt.
Ushering him out the door for dinner when he was more relaxed I was
lucky when he said he was starving and quickly got dressed. We just
found a quite spot to eat that was next to the wharf and got back to the
hotel just in time for our surprise guest. He wanted to go have a shower
and settle down for a massage, so I told him I'd join him in a minute, I
just had to make a phone call real quick which he thought was odd and
asked me if everything was alright, I reinstated that I'd just be a minute,
trying not to let on about anything. The knock came quietly on my
room's door just on time, as we had planned and I told her my idea to
surprise him. I let her into the bathroom where she orchestrated my plan
perfectly. Jeffrey finished his shower without me and when he called out
for me I told him that I needed him to have a look at something in my
room real quick. Not giving in to what it was that he would be looking at,
he came into the room where I opened my bathroom door to reveal a
beautiful nude girl bathing in a thick amount of soap bubbles in my tub
looking at him with an alluring intrigue. His grin went from ear to ear
when she stood up and introduced herself letting the bubbles run down
her glistening body at an ever-slow pace. It was a proud moment for
Jeffrey, I had done well in his eyes, and she was not like the other girls I
had brought to him before, degraded from a lifetime of abuse off the
streets. This girl was exactly his pro quo looking sweet and innocent as
the girl next door. My efforts were to show him I knew that my only
responsibility was to keep him happy at all costs. I led her through the
massage on Jeffrey and of course afterwards gratifying his perversion
with his lustful requests to be fondled and watch us become more than
just friends. I didn't feel too bad at the time with his coercion providing
many financial rewards making his scheme enticing to a young,
impressionable teen not realizing the terrible memories left to come from
all of this. Afterwards he paid her the usual two hundred dollars he gave
to everyone for their time and took down her name and phone number
writing it in his infamous little black book of the contacts he met in every
city but only the ones he really liked made it down in his records.
We went out the next afternoon as I had suggested last night and we ate
our clam chowder breadbaskets over looking the wharf's bay, watching
the seals playfully barking at each other on the rocks nearby. Shortly after
we were driven to the private airstrip and took off for Los Angeles. On
the plane was an unexpected visitor. Matt Groening the producer of the
"The Simpson's" T.V show was catching a ride with us. I was so excited,
as I loved watching his show and acted like a star struck fan, asking him
everything from his initial idea for creating the show to where he got his
characters from. He told me it was all based on his own family make up,

but without the crazy father and son scenes of Homers hand around Bart's
I was enjoying our conversation, when Jeffrey insisted that I give Matt
a foot massage throughout the duration of the short flight. I never turned
down a client but when I saw the shape of his feet, I nearly threw up at
the thought of having to touch them. He had yellow crusty toenails that
even someone with a chainsaw would've had troubles cutting through
and then there was the fluffy balls of leftover pieces of sock wedged
between the crevices of his sweaty toes, now that was the real icing on
the cake for me, no way could I attempt this I thought. Then I had an
idea. I went to the back of the plane and rinsed a wash cloth in warm
soapy water and returned for his dreaded foot massage but not before
attempting to clean them first.
In return for my services Matt was kind enough to draw me two quick
sketches on blank paper from his briefcase of my two favorite characters,
Homer and Bart. I asked if he would make them out to my little brother
and dad, the true fans of the family not missing an episode during dinner
over the past ten years or so. Next to the A-4 size drawing he was able to
fit in the quote "To my greatest fan from Matt Groening" and their names
next to it. I knew they'd absolutely love it, and it was such a nice gesture
his feet were no longer an issue as I laughed it off and even made a joke
to the comedian about getting a pedicure before hitting L.A's beaches.
The flight was only short and we arrived in busy L.A within the hour,
saying Good-Bye to Matt, who was a pleasure to meet. Jeffrey had a

with blue eves. a stereotypical Barbie doll. In her younger years she had
been a successful model and now lived on the beaches of Santa Monica
with a sweeping view of the oceans landscape as her backyard.
The next morning Jeffrey and I went out to breakfast. He said Sarah
Keller, would be joining us with another one of Jeffrey's girls I hadn't
met yet, her name was Nadia Bjorlin and she was a Yugoslavian model
turned aspiring actress, with the help of Jeffrey, as he so proudly
remarked at the table before they arrived shortly thereafter. She was a
stunning brunette with olive skin tones and shocking blue eyes. By far
one of the most beautiful girls I had ever met before. She and Sarah
approached the table, shopping bags in hands already in the early hours of
the day. They both pulled out a chair and showed us their new pair of
Jimmy Choo's they had bought on their way here this morning, and
excitedly asked for Jeffrey's opinion. He loved the doting attention and
anyone who could make him feel important. We all went back to Sarah's
apartment that Jeffrey rented for her on Malibu Beach. This was the first
time Jeffrey came to visit and when we got there you could see why. It
was a tiny one-bedroom shack, too small for his likes of accommodation,
but she loved it and it was plain to see why, the waves lapped underneath
her porch twice a day, what else could anyone want. Before even walking
through her door, you could hear the commotion of excitedly screaming
females voices coming from inside. There were about five other girls in
Sarah's living room and she had invited them so Jeffrey could have a few
different girls to choose from. Jeffrey looked at Sarah and smiled, aren't
you sweet, as all the girls rushed to introduce themselves, hoping for the
opportunities Sarah had offered them to come in the first place.
We all had some coffee and biscuits while the conversation kept getting
louder and louder, every girl trying to talk over the next one. Jeffrey
could handle only so much of that before getting too annoyed. Instead of
choosing one of the other new girls, Jeffrey wanted Sarah to show Nadia
and I into her bedroom. He was anticipating the introduction of his two
favorite girls together, what mischief he had hoped we would get up to
was apparent when he asked where Sarah had kept her play toys and not
the fisher price ones. Sarah brought out quite a collection of her personal
toys and was giggling on her way out as she shut the door. Suddenly the
room behind us went quiet, probably hoping to catch a moan or groans
too laugh at and I felt so degraded having everyone knowing exactly what
was going on. Knowing my duties well I was baffled this time as there
was no ritualistic massage wanted. He immediately instructed us to start
kissing and fondling each other with the provided toys straight away
seeing his excitement grow watching us try and out do the other one with
pleasure, he couldn't keep restraint any longer and started to have
intercourse with the both of us, taking his erect penis out of the other to
only swap to the other girl, back and forth. This continued for a good
fifteen minutes or so while we continued to engage in lesbian acts on
each other while the other girl was being subdued by Jeffrey's thrust's of
penetration. Nadia was just as dutiful as I was in fulfilling his demented
requests, willing to lend her body to Jeffrey and those he sent her too, for
the sake of keeping her acting career and putting on a good act at that.
She was never competition though. Once I found out where she actually

stopped at a fifties looking diner and got a cheeseburger and vanilla
milkshake, the first and only time 1 saw Jeffrey eat what I considered to
be real food. Seven lanes to drive in and the freeway was still lined
bumper to bumper in the heavy rain. The sound of downpour on the
rooftop of the taxi and the rhythm of the windshield wipers was making
me sleepy. I was looking forward to sleeping through the long flight
back. Thank goodness we had a private jet to catch back, the trip would
be comfortable and not rushed to get there on time through the daily peak
hour traffic. Jeffrey asked me what I thought of Nadia, more of a kiss and
tell kind of thing for him, so proud to admit some of his tenacious acts of
pedophilia to me that I knew most people would be embarrassed to even
think aloud but I said what he wanted to hear when he asked me what I
had thought of her on the way back. I replied, "She is attractive, funny,
and seems to know what she is doing with you." Laughing at my
statement, he then started to tell me the history behind where he got her.
Five years ago when she was merely a teenager just turned thirteen. Her
father had recently passed away, leaving Nadia's mother in a tremendous
amount of debt and living in a third world country, she didn't have the
means necessary to raise her own daughter. When Ghislane approached
Nadia for the first time at a music school, she seemed like a maternal,
caring stepmother. Telling Nadia's mother if she let Nadia go with her,
she would se to it personally that Nadia receive the best education and
chances in life to make it. In her customs it wasn't odd for a young girl to
be married off to bring the family good fortune, so she kissed her baby
girl good-bye and sent her off to commence her life of servitude. I sat
there speechless listening to Jeffrey brag about his endeavor to get her
over here, shocked that he could stoop as low to use a barely teen to
oblige his sexual desires. He was laughing and giddy as he replayed the
memories of her arrival over in his head, painting me a horrific picture I
had no choice but to imitate a smile to face him with.
No pretty girl is safe from the allurement of these villains procuring the
youth off of every street in the world. I knew that day more than ever
Heatery gime lad ideas eries likes benefite ince old me
career, finances, or an achievement in marriage with a successful
colleague of his. Mine was the massage career, ever so often still giving
me a lesson from a professional, which kept me quiet for a while longer.
I thought was already knee deep in this world, if I gave up after putting
myself through all of this hell it would've all been be for nothing. So I
treaded lightly, constantly at a risk of being replaced by another willing
participant and playing the eager student he wanted me to be.
Chapter 9
We met Ghislane and Emmy in N.Y.C, and it wasn't a blissful reunion
as I hoped for, wanting a break from all of this I was just looking forward
to getting back to Palm Beach, not leaving for a further four more days. I
got home late in the evening as Jeffrey invited me out to the movies after
we had relaxed at his house for a while after landing.
I put my keys through the door to my apartment and walked in to a
quiet house. Not thinking anyone was at home I set my suitcase on the
floor and put my cell phone on charge as I always did to be accessible for
whenever Jeffrey or Ghislane could call. I went to get a drink out of the
fridge when I heard some noises coming from the back of my apartment
where my bedroom was. I started back there and slowly turned my
doorknob to reveal T. on top of another girl. When they noticed they
weren't alone anymore, T.J got off her with promptness. I recognized the
girl from seeing her around at parties, and she was the town lowie,
scattering her trail of guys along with her presumable diseases, and I
wasn't shy to verbalize that when she tried to open her mouth and calm
the heated situation between T.J and I. She didn't like her cards on the
table in front of the guy she was screwing around with and got up in a fit
of rage to attack me. Still nude with only my new white sheets to cover
her body, I threw her out of my house along with T.J. "I have been
paying your way for months, only finding out your sleeping with the
biggest slut in Royal Palm Beach, at least have some dignity and higher
your standards." I didn't really have a leg to stand on since I had started
this relationship giving him the knowledge I had a sugar daddy to answer
to above him. "You're gone all the time and with that old man, what did
you expect me to do"? He was right, I wanted what 1 couldn't have, but I
needed some time to cool down and accept my situation. I loved having
T.J around to come home too, and he used to be my best friend in my
school days. I convinced myself of the lies I continued to accept.
Days later I was still not speaking with T.J, mentally adjusting to my
circumstances, I thought I'd have the day off to relax since I hadn't been
called all day. Until about five pm when Ghislane called and said Jeffrey
would like a massage in an hour. Grudgingly I got up from relaxing on
the couch, got dressed and put my make-up on, meeting Juan downstairs
a half an hour later. Jeffrey was already Iving on the massage table when
1 walked in. I started the massage being very quiet from my somber
mood, when Jeffrey picked up on it and said "you know it's not good to
massage people when you're angry, you could pass on negative energy"
I wasn't sure if he was serious or just trying to be nice so I could speak
about what was bothering me. Ending up not being able to contain my

emotion any further I told him what happened with T.J and broke down
in tears, a little heart broken from living in such a lie. He turned around
from his massage and sincerely paused for a second thinking he was
going to console me but instead he laughed at the very prospect of my
notion that monogamous relationships ever existed. "Are you serious, he
was only doing what every guy in the world does, you can't hold that
against him". I replied in a lighthearted gesture "whose side are you on
anyways"? His answer stuck with me for many years to come "I'm on
your side which is why I'm going to save you a lot of grief with this one
tip, Never expect a man to be faithful and you'll never be let down, it's
just the way us men are genetically imprinted." The remainder of the
massage I had to pretend like I wasn't further saddened by his response,
but in fact having to act enlightened. I would never come to him for any
other relationship advice, ever again. He told me l'd be fine if I just
listened to my mentor. He still loved role-playing the teacher and me the
pupil, like the old days before he got rich and only used to be a college
professor. I finished the massage and fulfilled my sexual duties before
being sent home wanting to collapse in anguish.

his guilt and promised that he would never see her again, agreeing with
me that she was the town slut and he screwed up big time. I let him back
into my apartment and back into my life for that matter but more aware of
the world I was being led into believing was of normal conduct accepted
by everyone in this sick world. Jeffrey was going back to N.Y. C and told
me to have a few days off before his assistant at his office would arrange
an E-Ticket on a commercial flight for me to join him later in the week. I
had just made loads of money from my previous trip and wanted to relax
like any teenager does, so i threw a hotel party that weekend on Singer
Island in Rivera Beach, inviting only a small group of friends to begin
The hotel room quickly filled up with a flood of teens and the pumping
music was blaring. The room had a balcony overlooking the pool and the
beach that became the smoker's section. I wasn't a real smoker at that
point, preferring to have a puff of a spiffed blunt instead so I made it my
rule to go outside trying to prevent holes in the carpet, but it didn't last
too long when our forbidden walls came tumbling down. Making so
much money that I could supply my wild parties with an assortment of
drugs like trips, ecstasy, and coke as well as an abundance of alcohol, that
T.J had all the contacts for, made my fellow teens admire me. It definitely
gave me a head swell, thinking here I was so young but so grown up
already with all of my peers from high school looking up to me. In the
wee hours of the morning we were all still going hard with our eyes
dilated into little black diamonds. We were all having in depth
conversations about life and where we would all end up when this
charade was all said done. Nobody got to sleep that night as the room
slowly dwindled in numbers as people were finding their way home to
recover from the repercussions of drugs wearing down out of their
intoxicated system.
When I flew out to N.Y.C to meet Jeffrey the next day, I was still in a
horrible state. Not knowing what was wrong with me, thinking it was just
a bad come down, I rushed out of the elevator and down the hall to my
room, sweating profusely, to make it just in time to the toilet to throw up
bile again for the uncountable time since getting off the plane. I was
having intense cramps in my stomach and when I was called down to
meet Jeffrey in the massage room, I had to decline for the first time. I told
the housekeeper that I was feeling very ill after the flight, maybe some off
food for lunch and needed to lie down for a while. Nobody came up to
check on me for hours or even called. Waking up from my much-needed
nap, I pulled back the expensive white sheets to find myself in a pool of
my own sweat and blood. I was covered in the red stains that drenched
the pants I was wearing. I had no idea what was going on, I could only
focus on the dire amount of pain I was in. In between the heaves of
throwing up and crying simultaneously 1 was able to reach the phone and
called the housemaid on the intercom. I told her I needed to go to a
hospital immediately and slammed the phone down only to fall back to
the floor hurdled in a ball. She didn't hesitate in calling Ghislane who ran
up to see what was wrong. Ghislane then called Jeffrey who was in his
office at the time and told him to hurry up to my level, stressing to him
that it was an emergency. Thinking they really cared about me for the
first time since I had known them, they came with me to the hospital with
me. Now i realize I was only a liability in getting them caught and they
needed to get to the doctors before I could say anything incriminating.
They were suspecting the worst now and seeing he never wore a condom
with me and from our previous conversations they knew I always made

condition. Rushed in for immediate testing I was uncontrollably vomiting
and in so much agony, I was given an injection to help me to subside the
intense pain. A nurse came in to ask who would pay for this and although
I insisted my parents insurance still covered me, Jeffrey persisted that he
take care of all the medical bills and gave the nurse his information.

When the pain relief kicked in, everything and everyone dwindled
away until I felt like Alice in Wonderland who just swallowed the
shrinking tablet and everyone standing around me seemed to move so
quick, speak so loud and hover above me. When I awoke from my
induced state, I was alone in a different room. Not knowing at all what
went on but feeling a little better, I called in the nurse who looked
through my charts and checked my vital signs. Then told me the doctor
would be in shortly to inform me of the conclusion to my illness.
He was a tall man with dark hair, and a hardened look about him

deep nerve. I waited for the doctor to close the curtain before I let out any
emotion and cried for my disastrous lifestyle that was dragging me into a
world that I wanted to break out of. This reoccurring cycle of believing I
needed men like Jeffrey to succeed in my life was draining the last bits of

conversation about something. Jeffrey wasn't comforting at all, instead he
sent me back home to rest for a couple weeks, and I only fell deeper into
a depression, using all forms of self medication to treat my sorrows.
Two weeks later, as if Jeffrey was trying to lighten my spirits, he told
me I would be going to his island to meet a new client He is a Harvard
Professor, named Stephen
1. I would be spending two days with
him showing him around the island, dining with him, and treating him to
a massage whenever he wanted. Without Jeffrey even verbalizing the
need to have sex with him, he told me to keep him happy like I had my
first client. I packed my suitcase with island apparel, and kissed T.J good-
bye, who had at least offered me a warm embrace upon the news of my
miscarriage but none other than that knowing it wasn't his.
Stephen was a quirky little man with white hair and a mad scientist look
about him. We arrived separately and I greeted him when one of the
housekeepers picked him up from the airport and arrived by boat, instead
of helicopter as Jeffrey and Ghislane often arrive on. We made our
acquaintances and he looked as if he was tripping over himself with
words, obviously delighted with his company and location for the
weekend. I showed him around as Jeffrey had asked and took him on an

cliff and just sat there, not saying a word to each other besides to
compliment the sights mother nature that appealed to us. I didn't feel as if
I owed this stranger anything but what was expected of me by Jeffrey and
I could be polite, I just couldn't be myself.
We got back to the main villa to see what time dinner would be served
so we could have time to unpack and clean up beforehand. We both met
at six pm for dinner on the outside veranda. He sat at the head of the
table and I sat next to him, politely folding my napkin to put in my lap.
The first time Jeffrey and Ghislane had seen me cut meat and eat with a
fork and knife they were so appalled, making fun of my unsophisticated
habits. Ghislane took the fork and knife in her hands and proceeded to
show me how to politely cut my food and eat. Now that my mannerisms
had improved they wouldn't have to be worried about my etiquette when
someone important was around anyone. We both drank the red wine
supplied on the table and it seemed to warm me up on the breezy night
By the time dinner was served and another red wine bottle later, he
seemed to get funnier. I made fun of his tousled hair and he poked at me
for my skinny legs, calling me a wanna be-anorexic. When dessert was
brought out, he asked if he could receive one of the delightful massages
he has been hearing about from Jeffrey. I gulped more red wine down and
sweetly complied with his offer, dreading the moment I'd have to see his
naked body, let alone touch it. I asked the housekeeper Kathy that had
been serving us that night to please have someone set up a massage bed
in one of the cabana's. I went to my room to down a few Xanax, telling
him I wanted to freshen up after dinner but to meet me in his cabana in
twenty minutes or so. I was ready to go as I had said, twenty minutes
later, with the effects of the tablets mixed with the red wine, and I would
be free not to feel anything. He was still dressed when I got in the cabana,
obviously not accustomed to this and a lot shyer than what I had been
used to, I told him he'd need to undress and lie face down on the table,
putting a towel to cover his bare bottom to prevent him feeling
embarrassed during the massage. I gave the massage my earnest as l
always had, and quickly got through having intercourse with him. Not

The next day I took him down to the beach for a real massage under a

therapeutic strokes. Afterwards we had lunch back at the main villa and
went back down to the beach to swim out to the water trampoline about
one hundred meters off the dock. He didn't do any bouncing around or
anything like that. It was just a good base point for a rest spot after a long

swim. What was really cool about it though, was you could see through
the mesh and watch fish swimming underneath.
The rest of the afternoon we spent by the pool reading magazines and
eating fruit plates. Eventually he went to his cabana to have a nap later
on. That night after dinner and my mixed cocktail of Xanax and red wine,
Tasked if he'd like another massage before I went to bed. He just wanted
to stay up watching movies in Jeffrey's theatre room. As peculiar as that
request was to me I didn't argue it, I just hoped I hadn't disappointed him
in any way that could make it back to Jeffrey. I showed him how to use
the remote and turn off the T.V when he was finished before going to
bed. The next morning we were both catching a flight from St. Thomas
and we had no time for anything other than breakfast and packing, which
saved me from having to be too polite as we said our good-bye's from the
terminal in the airport, both hurriedly off in separate directions,
thankfully. I arrived back in Palm Beach, only to be told to catch another
flight the next day to N.Y.C, where Jeffrey would fix me up the money he
owed me for treating his colleague out to an entertaining weekend.
Chapter 10
I was fixed up more than what I had usually made for two days, which
was great because that car I had been saving for was finally within my
reach. I had been waiting for the freedom a car gives every teenager for a
long time, and now that I had over fifteen thousand dollars saved up I
could pretty much afford to go buy myself a nice car outright. Looking
much better than the last time I saw him Jeffrev acknowledged it. I went
to his office where he was waiting for me and he had a guest with him.
She was unusual looking to the common stereotype drop dead gorgeous
girls Jeffrey had normally introduced me to. Of Asian decent, her name
was Rena. Jeffrey had met her at an art gallery where some of her own
artwork was on display. She had a bubbly persona about her and I could
then understand why Jeffrey liked her so much, she fit into the
subservient category that he liked his girls to fall under. It was apparent
to me that they had already slept together in the short time span they had
met as there closeness was oddly noticeable and I wondered what it was
She frey fat he a her in exchant ork, promising ende world a am
artist, telling her he'd have her work in the all the museums in N.Y.C and
the best art exhibits. Everyone was promised something, and seemed to
be bought off in someway or another to be in his company. It was only a
matter of time that the truth would come out.
61
To my own amazement Rena was to be assisting me in Jeffrey's
massage this day, not being a total knockout or anything spectacular,
looks wise that is, but for some reason he seemed intrigued enough. As
we made our way through his spectacular mansion she was in total awe at
every corner. Commenting on the present artwork and décor that we
passed in every hall, it no longer seemed so grandeur to me anymore but
hearing someone else speak about it in such excitement reminded me of
the days when all of this seemed so unforeseen.
When we got to the massage room, or "The Dungeon" as 1 used to put
it for it's medieval looking appearance, we firstly out of custom all had a

and stroking the arches of his foot rhythmically. Rena took the
instructions well and began to massage him too. When we all went to the

Jeffrey absolutely loved the fact that two teenage girls were dually

my every move up his legs and buttocks, keeping up with every stroke
until he could not contain his arousal any longer and was already
requesting us to start kissing each other, the start of the very reason we
had even met in the first place.
He blatantly stopped the massage nowhere near being complete and
turned over to announce his increased arousal in a physical abundance of
grotesqueness. Moving over to the small couch in the corner of the room
he made a space for her to lye me down on the massage table as she had
being spoken down to with. From that very moment onwards and from
the look on his face he was yearning for her to orchestrate an hour of
deliverance upon my meek nature. He started to stroke his erect manhood
as he was being tantalized watching her take over every inch of my body
in a dominating act of seduction. I was left breathless and soar after my
first introduction into the world of S&M.
Rena considered herself a dominatrix, she loved bondage, whipping
hitting, and eventually cutting her sex partner with little sharp knives
until they subdued to her punishment in agonizing pain. She was
absolutely crazy if you were to ask me, and I couldn't help but wonder
what got her into this in the first place. All I knew was that Jeffrey was
absurdly taking into the appeal of watching us two interact, often with her
amount of whips and oys. Then she would love to fish oftenary
session by hitting me across my face with a hard blow from the back of
her hand and sneering over my curled up body showing Jeffrey her ability

to make others surrender to her extreme force. She could be so opposite
all of the sudden and be tenderly intimate with Jeffrey stroking his penis
lovingly and even speaking in baby talk to him, which he seemed to
He loved us pairing up so much that within months he made Rena an
official even renting her an apartment at the same place he had one for me
during my extensive trips out to N.Y.C. Sending us out shopping together
at all of the underground seedy sex stores downtown we would bring him
back thousands of dollars worth of sexy outfits, sex toys and bondage
material. His favorite one was a black leather studded collar that lead
down the back of my spine to cuff my hands and feet together, offering
Rena the most compromising positions to wield her afflictions, one she
was excited to pick out for my usage.
She was good at eradicating my softer side though. Helping me forge
an unpredictable scenario of me turning the tables on her, making her at
my will instead of me always being at her twisted discretion. Jeffrey
loved the rivalry between us, both striving to dominate the other one but
to me it was just another way of surviving her punishment. All for show I
thought she was a madman let loose in a torturesome domain of violent

seen him show a girl. Obviously moved by her gesture, he got her an
exhibit in N.Y.C's "Metropolitan Museum of Art" where she submitted
her very own piece. She sculpted an image of my headshot out of clay,
shaping it with the strands of my long hair blowing across my face. I was
taken aback myself at her creation. She really did have an amazing talent
if not for her meaner streak she would've been a great friend. I will never
forget Rena, for all of the ups and the downs we endured together.
It wasn't too much longer before I finally had enough of the abuse in
the bedroom and I had to tell Jeffrey what I was feeling. She was getting
even more violent as time went on, and with her questioning me and
Jeffrey why she didn't get brought on long trips with him, she didn't get
the fact that she was just a tool for him to use. Jeffrey said he was already
thinking about getting rid of her off of his "regular list". He said she was
becoming too clingy and he didn't like clinginess or jealousy. I never
even got to say good-bye or take the opportunity to keep her as a friend,
like a girlfriend to catch up with once and awhile, but that's how it was
with Jeffrey, one day you sat under the blanket of his comfortably and the
next without any warning you could be discarded like yesterdays news.
She would've taken it hard but that's the game we were playing and it
ana those shopsey what iday or ten effey gave me a thousand

a young woman, I felt beautiful. He had yet another surprise in store for
similar interests we did fun things like go to the theatre to watch
style pizza. Like I said, we really liked each other purely as friends but
the dominance in the massage chambers was taking it's toll on our
strange friendship. One average trip back to N.Y.C, she surprised Jeffrey
with a six foot by six-foot oil painting of her and I lying nude in a ying
and yang position facing each other. Although we were soliciting each
other with sexual innuendo the picture was still very carefully
orchestrated to perfectly portray the darker side of Jeffrey's thrills. It was
us together but was not expecting anything of this grand magnitude she
had presented him with. He lifted her from the ground and twirled her
proud gore hed, thed herping strey had bolier, de handed her a
small wad of cash as her payment. It was the most appreciation I had ever
posing in full body shots being sexually exposed as a gift for Jeffrey. I
did as they asked and took my two photos into the office where Jeffrey's
assistant was waiting for my arrival. Still not telling me what the
headshots were for, she took them from me and told me to have a seat for
a second. A moment later I heard Jeffrey call me into the office. "I like
what you've done with your hair, you've gone more blonde, suits your
glowing tan". I replied with an appreciative "thank-you" for sending me
to such a renowned hairstylist, and shopping money. I showed him my

Campbell. I was so over-joyed with excitement, what girl my age with a
background like mine was attending socialite parties and globetrotting the
world. It only made it harder for me to see beyond the elusive walls I had
put up to protect myself from the appalling truth.
We left in early April first going to London, Paris and then our final
destination being St. Tropez in Southern France. If Hallmark had a
postcard, St. Tropez would definitely be on the front of it. It was beautiful
spring weather and every where you looked women were dressed in
bikini tops branded with some kind of designer label embedded into it
and the men were following them around like harping dogs in heat. In all
of the elegance of the Mediterranean, "La Bastide De St. Tropez" was an
impressive landmark. Jeffrey and Ghislane were staying in one of the
private cottages, on the park on the grounds, while Emmy and I stayed in
separate quarters inside the hotel. The old style cobblestone streets were
lined with boutique shops and beauty parlors. It was the hedonistic
stomping grounds of the beyond rich and famous.
The next day we went out to lunch at the grand opening of the
infamous Nikki Beach Club, where a cheap glass of champagne costs
around two hundred dollars and if your not keeping the alcohol
consumption flowing like water, you'd be asked to leave to make way for
the constant flow of prospectus patrons. That's where I first got to meet
Naomi Campbell. She was wearing the typical attire strutting around
southern France, a D&G bikini top and a wrap around mini skirt to go
over the swimsuits bikini. She was so tall and stunningly beautiful. Her
charisma was energetic, funny, and everyone seemed to hang off of her
every word and laugh at her every joke. Ghislane and Jeffrey kissed her
cheeks and wished her a happy birthday, and then I was introduced and
followed in their suit. She was surrounded by a league of assistants,
friends and fans, which didn't make it easy for us to all converse but she
got enough time in to invite us abroad a yacht of a fellow she was "kind
of seeing" at the time for the before party ahead of tonight's event. We
went back to the hotel and I gave Jeffrey a massage in his room before we

swept up my long hair in a wisen tip. only eting down a ere ly
for the party to come it was the first celebrity birthday bash 1 had ever
been to. Being introduced to model after model and the rich men that
followed them around became dizzying. Jeffrey sat back and watched as I
buoyantly worked the dance floor, coming back to the table where he
was, only to grab another glass of champagne every now and then. Every
so often he'd introduce to me to someone new, pulling me aside to show
off his eager young masseuse to his fellow pedo's. These people had so
much money pouring out of them. I don't know why he even thought
they'd care in the first place. It made me feel good though. At least I
knew I made him proud to have me in his company.
Being surrounded by so many of Jeffrey's colleagues and his
likeminded people that were considered the most sophisticated and the
highly esteemed of today's world nearly made the way I was living lately
more fathomable, at least to myself. I thought if everyone looks up to
these people and they are all accepting of it, it must be just the way the
world turns. I danced with a young prince that night and with all of the
help from the bubbly champagne I couldn't remember his name for the
life of me. On one of my trips back to the table for another glass, Jeffrey
leaned over to quietly whisper in my ear that it was a prince that I had
actually been dancing with and I didn't phase me in the least way. I went
back to the dance floor and continued to let my hair down. It was a fun
bash, the entire crowd sang "Happy Birthday" to Naomi and by the time
we got back in the car to retreat for the night, I was giddy froin the

his name in the first five minutes of our meeting again. He was the hotel
owner of some large chain in America called "Hilton". Staying at one of
the cottages near Jeffrey, he saw it quaint to loan me out for a night's
massage to ruin an "almost" perfect evening. Jeffrey told me to come
back to his room after I was finished with Rick, thankfully he reminded
me of his name but also odd I thought, being so late I would've never
imagined Jeffrey could stay up this late but i never made a fuss out of his
requests. I gave him affirmation of my understood instructions and
headed off with this stranger into the darkness.
I dimmed the bright lights in his bedroom to a softer tone as if it might
aid the vision of this short, balding man with straggling remnants of curly
brown hair left to show for the remaining bits of youth left in him. I had

bottom of the floor as he was saying "You can't really expect to give a
massage wearing this, here sweetie, I'll help you out of it." He just
wanted to see the hidden bounty my clothes were hindering his eyes from
seeing. I just went about my way trying to get his hands off of me and to
get him to lie down for a massage. Making quaint conversation with him
was pointless as I was trying to send his thoughts elsewhere other than
the apparent perverted schemes replaying in his mind from the heavy
breathing he was making and the looks he was giving to me. I was using
all of the tricks in the "turn-off" book even asking him about his wife and
Unquestionably he was in seventh heaven turning every one of my
distractions into another flattering compliment. He was saying things like
"I love what you do you to me, I have never felt like this before, come
stay with me and I will pay you double, no, triple whatever Jeffrey pays
you!" Knowing he was just a drunk idiot, I wasn't being lured in by any
of his offers of money or a privileged lifestyle, I knew these cages all too
well and I was better off sticking with the one that I was at least
accustomed to avady. Holding back ay composure ory ae ties king

already getting quickly get dressed and hurrying out his cottage door.
When I got to Jeffrey's cottage I rushed through the door and told
Jeffrey and Ghislane, who were sitting front of the fireplace reading a
books, that I never ever wanted to see that guy ever again. When they
asked me what was the matter, I told them of every thing that had
happened that night even how he offered me to come work for him
getting paid triple. I established a lot of trust with Jeffrey that night. He
asked me why I didn't accept the offer and I responded with " Who
would look after you, if I were gone?" Like a caring grand father would
do, he pulled me into his chest for a hug and told me that it meant a lot to
him. It was so late and I was so tired but I still had to give Jeffrey his
massage that night. He asked me to just rub his feet as he fell asleep, and
thankfully he was out like a light in no time. The next morning I took two
headache tablets and a ginger ale instead of a coffee. Trying to contain
my hangover as best as possible behind a pair of sunnies it was mid
afternoon by the time I had felt like myself again. We spent the day Yacht
hopping, soaking in the sunny weather while Jeffrey and Ghislane caught
up with old acquaintances, Emmy and I were just accessories to look
good on the arms of them. The next day we wrapped up the tail end of
our trip and commenced our flight back into the U.S. I was paid a
generous amount and set off to go car shopping as soon as I got back to
Florida. Through a private seller, I was able to pay out right for my car. I
got a Dodge Dakota in cherry red, and immediately had an impressive
sound system put in. She was my first pride and joy and taste of freedom.
I would love to drive her down to Lakeworth Beach to sit in my car and
wateh the waves while I listened to my stereo blare music and puffed on a
jay. Letting the rest of the world pass by while I sat back and watched
them walk past wondering to myself what their story was about.
I turned seventeen that summer and had accumulated a string of exotic
destinations that I had travelled in such a short time. I was given more
make-up and a pair of diamond earrings from Jeffrey. Ghislane only
wished me a happy day, wondering at times if she felt threatened by
Jeffrey's and my closeness. We went to the island after we left N.Y.C and
I asked If Sarah would be meeting us, mentioning it had been a while
since we had last seen her. He said he had some bad news about her.
Expecting the worse, thinking she had gotten hurt or something, 1 was
astounded when Jeffrey told me that she had been sent to his island with
one of his friends for a couple days and when the housekeepers were
the bather room and they found a stash of cocaine left out carelessly in
He said he had no choice but to let her go. Addicts with no respect for
themselves or his wishes had no leeway in Jeffrey's book. He didn't mind
that I dabbled in drugs once in a while as long as I never brought them
along with us on any trips, except for my Xanax, which he didn't mind
because it was pharmaceutical and most of all wouldn't cause him trouble
being a legal narcotic. Sarah took it too far when she crossed international
borders with an illegal drug, risking her welfare and almost costing
Jeffrey public attention. She lost her apartment and contacts in the acting
world, only hearing from acquaintances once in a while that she was
sinking deeper and deeper into the black hole of addiction. It was sad to
find out, as l always did like her.
At the island, Ghislane had just recently obtained her helicopter pilot's
license and wanted to get some practice airtime and flew Jeffrey and I to
St. John where we picked up Alexandria Cousteau, the grand daughter to
the inventor of the scuba tank and underwater explorer Jack Cousteal.
Ghislane was out to set us affright in the air, but it was all talk, she was
actually an impressive pilot. Still a daredevil though, she got her kicks
out of hearing us fret on the earmuffs intercom's. Jeffrey made it clear
that Alexandria was a guest when I was told to adhere to her if she
wanted a massage, which I obliged her with several times during our first
meeting. It was Jeffrey who instigated that her and I reenact as lovers in
lesbian acts of foreplay and penetration. I couldn't imagine a girl with

such high prospects lowering herself to something of Jeffrey's standards,
but I later found out through Jeffrey that he had donated money to her
continuous exploration into marine life and habitats. She had followed in
her family's footsteps, all of them involved in Marine Biology in some
way or another. We actually got along really well, she was a real decent
girl, and loved talking about her passion, everything underneath the
When I wasn't busy giving massages to everyone around, her and I
would hang out together. Often we go swimming in the crystal clear pool
of ocean that the Caribbean had to offer. Once we swam out so far not
paying attention to our location and were carried out to sea by the current.
We took turns on the backs of each other, taking breaks against the strong
ocean tide. It was almost a possibility that we nearly drowned out there, if
it weren't for some guys on a boat out fishing for the day when they
caught us in their view. They picked us up and brought us back to the
island where we were reprimanded by a worried Jeffrey and Ghislane to
first of all let someone know where we are going at all times, and never
to lose sight of the shore while out for a swim. After that learning
experience I took their heed and proceeded with caution. I had a
newfound respect for the ocean and it's mysteries.
Having such a lover of the water as a guest, made Jeffrey want to
explore parts of his Caribbean he had never seen before. The next
morning we were met by a scuba instructor in St. James and given a few
lessons in how to use the gear and more tips like how to descend slowly
to the ocean floor as not to cause blood clots as well as visual hand
signals to communicate underwater. It was so exhilarating beneath the
waters surface. No voices to listen too, only the enchanting sights to take
in. We explored the surrounding reef and found a large squid, many of
rica varieny on tocal species of lon. d was that a gread a many of the
in. Holding a permanent mental picture of those adventures to carry in my
head for all times.
We all had such a great time that Jeffrey hired the same scuba
instructor to come out the next day to scuba dive the safer parts around
his island. We got bored quickly with not much to see but seaweed and a
fish here and there. It didn't take long before Ghislane decided for us all
to explore other numerous locations by boat, Jeffrey needed a bit of
convincing at first and the instructor was quick to assure him that he
knew his way well around these waters, of course he would say that, he
was getting paid a hell of a lot to do this in the first place, why not extend
The clear water glistened and the tropical array of marine life was on
display as we wanted to stop at so many places but you could see as
beautiful as it was it could be as equally dangerous. It took so long as we
had to veer away from so many desirable spots. Finally we found a good
place that the scuba instructor thought was safe. He buddied us up into
pairs and we jumped off the back of the boat into the crystal aqua blue
waters beginning our descent slowly into the darker regions of the oceans
floor. We were situated on open water with a cavern of reefs to venture in
and around down below. It seemed to be quite a choice to scuba in, one
that our guide said he wasn't familiar with but to alleviate his bored
clientele deemed safe to swim around.
It was Jeffrey and the Guide together, Ghislane and Emmy, and I was
paired up with Alexandria. Miles, the houseman, came with us and stayed
on the boat just in case something went wrong and lucky he did. We were
all too far under the water to hear his alarming screams of distress when
shadow's lurking in the murky distance started appearing closer and
closer. Ghislane actually looked frightened for once as she gave us the
signal to start ascending upwards, reminding us by holding her ears not to
go up to quick or as we were previously warned before we could pop a
blood vessel in our brain and hemorrhage to death, not a very lovely
image but neither was getting torn apart by sharks. Those giant shadows
Species as theraid son enough a gres recognize theirindinine

to get on the boat imaging the worst as I waited behind Emmy and
Alexandria who were the next to follow after Jeffrey and Ghislane I was
in too much shock to scream or cry, I just told myself I had to stay calm
to get out of this alive. Unlucky for us we found out later on that we were
in their breeding territory and being sent a clear message that we were
soon to be on the menu to their feeding frenzy.
We all felt like we had cheated death and I know it wasn't only my
heart that was still beating out of my chest when we headed back to
Jeffrey's island. Jeffrey was pale as his designer sheets and looked like he
had aged another ten years in such a scared state. Ghislane took the heat
off herself even barely taking a notice of beforehand and decided to poke
fun at all of us frantically scurrying to get out of the water, it was just her
nature, as I had never seen her move so quickly either. We got back to the
island and all collapsed our fatigued bodies in our own beds for a long
nap. Freshened up and much more relaxed we regaled our horrendous
story again over dinner, this time in laughter. The following afternoon
Ghislane piloted us all in the helicopter to St. John's Airport and we said
regular of his, probably not as easy as the troubled girls were to bribe.

Chapter 11
Throughout the remainder of the quickly passing year I was on a
constant move with Jeffrey. Attending various dinner parties, mostly with
other esteemed billionaires and widely acclaimed scientists. Jeffrey likes
to surround himself with the most brilliant and powerful of minds, filling
his little black book with some of the most esteemed and even infamous
people in today's wealthy society. It was during those intellectual
gatherings that my body was also put on the banquet menu but this time
for a powerful senator George Mitchell and another prominent Nobel-
Prize winning scientist who's name would be mentioned but for all the
life of me can no longer remember. They would be only some of the
recognizable figures of the high society that became added to my list of
clientele, of course being introduced to for a lot more than just a client of
As an amusement to Jeffrey's associates I also knew my place was to
entertain but not to every desired content. I was to show them a good time
but not the way I would have to use technique and effort for Jeffrey. The
very teachings from Jeffrey himself, or my tutor, as he liked to so
eloquently put it. Consistently being used and adored for the likeliness of
my youthful looks I was becoming very accustoned to my lifestyle with
Jeffrey, never really relaxing into it, but just accepting this as being as
good as it will ever get for me. I didn't think I should be complaining,
wasn't 1 being offered a life in exchange for servitude? Just letting the
signs of my anxiety and depression pass me by while I blanketed them
with my pills, suffocating under a blanket of pain is all I was really doing

who doesn't celebrate the occasion, as he is of Jewish descent. Not that
he was a religious man anyways, I never even saw him celebrate
Hanukah either. We firstly stayed at his ranch in Santa Fe for a week,
then left for a long plane trip to Paris, France where we all suffered jet lag
for the next twenty four hours. We all stayed in a grand hotel with a view
the Champs' Elyse.

and felt each other's sorrows. All four of us went out shopping at Chanel,

follow eated on And gid i seney box eh my parite try done, and
bought some new tapestries to have sent back to Santa Fe for his ranch.
We also visited his up and coming Paris apartment. It was a modern,
typical flat being refurbished, and we went to see how it was all looking.
Jeffrey liked to fuss about every detail and harass the builder's about their
work, changing last minute details at a whim.
Days and many croissants later we left for Spain feeling bloated and
sleepy. We only stayed in Spain for the afternoon, going to see another
astounding Moroccan castle for Jeffrey to replicate at one of his many
mansions. It was only a short plane ride to Tangier, Africa for more
castles hopping. We arrived at the historic landmark and the only five star
hotel in Tangier called El Minzah in the village of Ville Nouvelle. The
city and outskirts were still very hostile at the time, females being warned
to not walk the streets alone and not to leave the house after dark or be at
risk of being raped or worse.
When we got to the room, it was oozing with every expected bit of
extravagance that a luxurious historical palace should offer until I was
greeted with a pile of monkey poo in the very middle of my bed. Not a
happy camper I called Jeffrey, Ghislane and Emmy into my adjoining
room and they all had quite a good laugh at my expense. Within a
moments notice of a complaint call to the front desk and we had an

Ghislane joked that maybe I should keep it open I might find a suitable
husband before I get any older. Always the instigator of a good joke but
unable to take one herself she didn't like when I poked back that it was
more in her recent taste of men, since she loved to brag about her
rendezvous with her various lovers. Once she came back giddy as a
schoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the build up and excitement
in her voice you'd think she was the next crown princess, but she had
given George Clooney a blowjob in the bathroom at some random event,
she never let that one down.
We all went to explore the towns surrounding Moroccan castles and
meet their royalty that lived in them. Jeffrey's personal interior designer's
met us at the residences. They walked around hurriedly, scribbling notes
into their clipboards and whispering between themselves. The palaces
were historically unique and beautiful but I wondered how could they live
so grandeur behind these walls when they lived in a city of such poverty
stricken squabble. Beggars lined the streets, people could just go missing
and no one could care less, and you heard of barbaric murders happening
every night. Against the advice of the Palace Attendant and Jeffrey's
wishes, I decided to take a stroll one afternoon, mainly just to take photos
of exotic Africa and do some shopping in the village markets but I ended
up being intrigued by a group of young children playing in the streets.

When I was noticed watching them, about fifteen of them came up to me
and began to beg for money and food. I was over taken by the poor,
hungry children and I felt sad for them all and wished I could help out
somehow. When the tide of kids washed away and the street went empty,
I was overcome with intrigue at these two little boys. Brothers I found out
later on, and there only toy was an empty can they were kicking to each
other in the middle of the street. Intelligent kids, they were able to speak
three different languages, including English and I was interested to ask
them about life here. They didn't seem to notice or be bothered by their
poverty stricken lives. They told me about their school and parents and I
thought I had just heard the saddest story ever but they were accustomed
to living like that like I had been so accustomed to my degrading lifestyle
1 was compelled to empty out the contents of my purse, giving them
over two thousand dollars in U.S currency. A passer-byer snapped a
photo of the kids and me for myself to take home as a personal souvenir
before they rushed home to proudly show there parents the money. I told
Jeffrey later on of my good deed and he couldn't believe I'd give away
my money so carelessly. He told me I had set up their parents with
enough money to feed and shelter their family for a year. Wasn't that a
good thing? I couldn't believe it, not that I was well off or anything close
too it, but to realize how lucky I was and to not have compassion for the
lesser off, especially children of a third- world country, I wouldn't be
human anymore. Then again what did I expect from someone who could
numerously steal another man's daughter for the use of his own sexual
pleasure with great ease.
We went out to lunch the following day with Jeffrey's team of
designers to wrap things up and after Jeffrey's afternoon massage he went
to the palace to have a nap. When I was all alone I thought I'd go see the
culture of the local unique markets again and this time buy some trinkets
to bring home. I got to sightseeing and took pictures of the legs of lamb
hung over the blood drenched doorway over people's homes as to warn
off evil spirits and the ghettos where the local villager's called home. I
walked into many of the market's stalls and saw the most peculiar
antiques, such as weaponry with the blood of it's last victim stained on
it's sharp blades and body pieces of various animal's for the use of
religious sacrifices. I was more interested in the different culture and
respecting their ancient way of life with interest, instead of squirming like
a tourist and getting grossed out. I thought it was so educational and
enthralling in fact, I ended up buying a few sacrificial trinkets to have
sent to my apartment in Palm Beach. Not to say that 1 wasn't looking
forward to getting back to the luxuries of western civilization it was a bit
like camping, fun and adventurous but as equally dangerous and thrilling.
When we left for the final destination of our trip I was looking forward to
eating normal food again, not one to stray for foreign dishes, I'm a more
of a cheeseburger and pizza kind of girl, a true sign of my American
We landed at the Heathrow Int'l Airport and greeted by a driver that
would take us to Ghislane's town house in London's central that Jeffrey
had recently bought and refurbished as a gift for her. Emmy said "Good-
Bye" at the airport, leaving us to go to her hometown in the rural
countryside nearby to visit family for a six-week holiday from work. It
wasn't a very long drive before we were in the heart of the city and at
Ghislane's place. I thought it was a cheery townhouse that had character
and the historical pub in front of it and cobblestone streets only added a
unique charm to its presence. They were going out for dinner and invited
me along with them but seeing 1 was so exhausted from all the travelling
and looking a bit melancholy, I apologetically declined going out for
dinner that evening, I rather would be taking a few pills to catch up on
some needed sleep. "Are you sure your Okay"? Ghislane asked as she
showed me to my room, more considerate than she normally was but I
assured her that I was in absolute good health, just tired from all of the
recent jet lag. Without another word said she whisked off downstairs, to
the car where Jeffrey was waiting for her.
I took the liberty to call my parents house to say "Hello" and catch up
with them since I hadn't been home at all for the holiday season this year,
always too busy working. They sounded really happy to hear from me
and my mom put me on the phone to talk to my brothers as well. I got to
tell them about my travels abroad and I had some cool tribal stuff from
Africa that I bought for them. They sounded so proud of me, all of them,
and why shouldn't they be? In everyone's convinced mind i was making
great money, travelling the world, and meeting new faces everywhere I
went, why should I spoil anyone's delusions, especially mine. I took my
sleeping tablets and had a bath before falling into a deep and much
The next morning I was woken up by Ghislane who I could tell was in a
chirpy mood by the way she paraded through my closed door saving
"Wake-up sleepy head" and opened the window's shutters to let in the
bright sunlight, she had never done anything like this before and I knew

build the suspense, before completing her sentence " To go dancing with
a Prince of England this evening". Hoping it would be one of the younger
generations, I was disappointed when she told me he was the Duke of
York, Charles's younger brother Andrew. I looked at her with a fake
surprised look, one I had to use on many occasions in my time with them,
to give an impression of excitement. "What... wow!" I exclaimed with my
gifted acting ability. It is a sad realization but I had grown more
accustomed to seeing people for their significance rather than the good
qualities they possessed, and was able to grin & bear the thought of what
I expected lay in store for me.
Ghislane and I left shortly thereafter for the many lanes of designer
shops to choose from in London. Her pep talks to prepare me for my
duties towards royalty went on and on, giving me the obscure impression
I was something of importance, at least for more than an evening. "Make
sure your bubbly and energetic, nobody want's a dead horse" was one of
the cheap tools she instilled me with. "Who knows where this could lead
for you" was another. As the day grew shorter my anxiety only
heightened, anticipating the Prince's arrival and unable to decide on an
outfit, I picked out three. Our last stop for the day was Burberry's for a
nice handbag to compliment our chosen attire. We got back to her
townhouse with still a couple hours spare to get ready. After trying on all
three outfits and many mental debates with myself later. I decided on the
pink mini-tee and dazzling pair of denims with horses embroidered into a
pattern. It seemed a lot more my style and age group rather than the other
iwo older looking sophisticated dresses I had picked out. I told myself I
was going dancing at a club not to an opera. As most young girls can be
during their body changes into womanhood, I felt awkward, you know,
big feet, freckles and body hair in unwanted places. They're things you
just don't want when your seventeen and then you see these iconic
billboards of what femininity is supposed to represent and just don't fit
peter. By the nehad got ready was aerous reck, buying 1o
keep my cool on the outside was an act. I thought it'd be a good idea to
take a few Xanax before the evenine unraveled and my anxiety went
through the roof.
Jeffrey and I were sitting in the lounge room downstairs, waiting for
Ghislane to finish getting ready. The room was silent, only stillness in the
air. I stared at the mural painted onto the wall that I was facing. It was an
interesting piece of artwork. In great detail it illustrated a happy looking
or and win a beaui home diskinged one were ideo oning hopiece
and the hunters chasing a game of fox like the notorious "English Hunt
Pieces" throughout history. Jeffrey took notice of my enchantment into
the picture and in a hushed voice proceeded to tell me that it was a
portrait of Ghislane's childhood, the part she could be proud of. I never
realized how prominent her family's history was in England, apparently
as to Jeffrey's attest, her Father was born of poor Jewish decent in
Czechoslovakia, most of his family being killed upon Nazi invasion in
1939. Fleeing to join the British Army as a young man, he changed his
name a few times and made a lot of contacts in the field. After the war, a
new found Robert Maxwell went into publishing using his army contacts
to establish a business initially built upon publishing scientific books
from occupied Germany. In time, Maxwell acquired several British
newspapers, among them the Daily Mirror, countering his wits against
the likes of Rupert Murdoch along the way. However, whilst constructing
his publishing empire, Maxwell compiled astronomical debts, and his
equivocal financial dealings attracted the attention of governing
authorities that judged him not to be looking out for his companies best
interest and in the end it transpired that Robert Maxwell had been using
proceeds from his employees pension funds to meet his financial debts,
ruining the futures of thousands of employees. Once an esteemed
Member of Parliament and publishing mogul, Robert's body was found
floating in the Atlantic Ocean after he was found to be missing from his
yacht, the Lady Ghislane (named after his favorite child), whilst cruising
the Canary Islands in I99I. Jeffrey went on to tell me that when her
Father died she was inconsolable, and in a very bad state. He picked her
up from the trenches of despair and took her under his wing, and it's there
she has stayed comfortable ever since. To Ghislane his peculiar need to
have so many woman around and even his taste in younger than legal
one's didn't seem unconventional to her. It was her own Father who was
deemed a womanizer and even took a second wife whilst still married to
Ghislane's mother. I would have never guessed this carefree, spirited, and
vivacious woman had ever endured such sorrows. I couldn't help but look
at her in a different light from then on, but not letting her know that I
knew, to avoid any altercations between us.
Like clockwork Ghislane came downstairs five minutes before Prince
Andrew were to arrive, wearing a tight-fitted white wooly turtleneck
singlet and a nice pair of loose fitting trousers. Looking elegant and
casual at the same time, a very hard look to achieve but one Ghislane had
always easily mastered. They both seemed at ease poking fun at my
obvious nervous state, just another ordinary night out for this
extraordinary couple. The knock came at the door just after six o'clock in
the evening. Ghislane greeted him and the guard who would wait for his
return in the car. She led him down the hall to where Jeffrey and I were
sitting. We both stood up and Jeffrey shook his hand, while Ghislane
proceeded to introduce me and as I was taught by her was English

custom, we both kissed on the check. We all sat down on the lounges for
some tea and biscuits while conversing idle chitchat. By the sounds of it,
Ghislane knew well of his recently divorced x-wife Fergie, whom they
were all taking turns in slandering her for one reason or another. It was
apparent there were some fresh wounds still lingering on and as good
friends do, it was their way of helping him get over her. When his
daughters were mentioned, Ghislane and Jeffrey treaded lightly, only
speaking highly of them, and offering their sympathy to the young ones.
The conversation turned to a much lighter subject. Andrew wanted to
know more about this young guest they had to join them out for dinner
and dancing that evening and then the spotlight turned on me. I was more
nervous than I had ever been before a night out with someone, probably
the build-up Ghislane and Jeffrey had hyped this meeting up to be. To
break the ice, she played her favorite guessing game... "how old do you
think Jenna is"? When Andrew guessed correctly, I was seventeen years
old, she was surprised, thinking I could have passed for younger. "I guess
we are going to have to trade you in soon" she laughed, always the first
one to throw in her quick-witted two bits, all of them chuckling along
with her. Hardly a laugh at all, unknown to me at the time his eldest
daughter is only five years my junior. I was finding it hard to make much
conversation in the beginning, just laughing when the occasion called for
it, and keeping up with Andrew's constant glances in my direction, was
all I could manage.
The restaurant was a close drive for us with Andrew, his two guards and
his driver following behind us. I was seated next to the Prince for dinner
and Ghislane and Jeffrey next to each other, an evening pre-ordained. I
was supposed to flatter him with compliments and dote on his every word
spoken, but I didn't even do that for Jeffrey blatantly, it would've felt
awkward to act like a bimbo for him. Instead I remained calm, cool, and
collected, hoping that my nervousness wouldn't spill out at any given
moment. The next place we were going was much more my style, and I
found it easier to relax. We pulled up next to a Nightclub called "Tramp".
a member's only nightclub, and one of the most exclusive haunts in the
world for the rich and famous to be seen for the last forty or so years
since it's doors first opened. Andrew's guards waited outside while we all
went in to hit the dance floor. Jeffrey being the social introvert that he
was found the first available empty seat in the corner but facing the dance
went to shena the evening wadik. He came back have Sparing water
for Jeffrey and a cocktail for the rest of us, already knowing that Jeffrey
never drank alcohol. We downed our glasses and made our way to the
crowded dance floor, where I had the Prince's upmost attention. Moving
his hands across the curves of my body, not to shy away from the fact
that he was in public, he was whispering sweet nothings into my ear and
kissing my neck. I would just giggle not really knowing how to reply to
an aging man with a bad smile and terrible moves, it would sound too
much of a lie if I retaliated back about his swagger. He was the most
incredibly hideous dancer I had ever seen and couldn't help but laughing
on the dance floor and shooting glances of embarrassment to Jeffrey and
Ghislane who were having a good time laughing at my expense...as the
After an hour of pelvic smashing to the D.J's pumping mixes we finally
exited the floor, his royal highness was dripping with sweat and ready to
embark onto a quieter scene where he said we could be alone, not
knowing that it had already been arranged for all of us to meet back at
Ghislane's place but complied with his so called thoughtful request. I was
so anxious about getting back to the townhouse, knowing what
expectations I would have to not only have meet but also exceed in this
case. Ghislane and Jeffrey seemed impressed at my attempts to entertain
his royal highness, so far giving him exactly what he wanted the
impression that I idolized him. They told me that he really liked me and
was having a great time, so far tonight. When we got to the townhouse,
his guards walked him to the door, staying to wait outside in the car.
Ghislane met him and brought him upstairs where Jeffrey and I were in
the study. We all chatted in the hall for a few minutes and I was able to
have Jeffrey snap a photo of us together, one that would cause much
controversy for the Buckingham Palace in many years to come. The
conversation didn't linger on much longer before Jeffrey and Ghislane
dispersed downstairs together, leaving me to my own sort of royal duties.
They walked away giddy as if they were teenagers imposing on young
lovers about to embark on a romantic evening.
Next to the study was the bathroom where I led him to next. The room
was dimly lit masking the light from showing the disparity in my eyes. It
was a beige marble tiled floor with porcelain Victorian style bathtub in
the middle of the room and nowhere near the size of Jeffrey's residences.
I turned on the taps for the tub and the heat from the water began to stean
up the small room. On the basin were aromatic oils, lotions and soaps,
loving the scent of floral notes, I poured in the lavender bath oil. Trying
to do the best of my youthfulness to try and act seductive, I gradually
began to strip off my clothing, piece by piece. Giving him time to savor
the moment to come. He loved every second of it as I went over to where
he was waiting and watching, then began to undress him at a much
quicker pace. We kissed and touched each other before submersing into
adoro water, where wey oh clinty o rect, car fosing y. Hoes and

but laugh, I hoped he didn't expect the same treatment back. Through my
recent experiences with Rena, I drew a line with extreme fetishes,
especially ones that would involve my tongue and feet in the same
sentence. It wasn't hard to get him wound up to the point where he just
wanted to have the rest of me so we dried off from the cold and retired to
my bedchambers for the longest ten minutes of my life. Moments later
and without any real emotional attachment, he burst in ecstasy, leaving
me to my own feelings of dismay. As relieved as I was to see the
experience come to pass with him, it was finally sinking in that I would
never be anything more than but a muse. Still trying to ascertain a surreal
dream a young girl once held but no longer the same girl I was no longer
sure that the dream was even real anymore. In the whirlwind thrown
together by wealth, power, and privilege I was but a grain of sand and felt
helpless down the road I was naively being led down. When the real
picture was unveiled, later in my life, I had nothing but memories filled
with sorrow to remember of my teenage years.
Jeffrey, Ghislane, and I left for the states to conclude our long journey
home to the U.S.A. I was so happy when we landed on our soil and called
T.J from my cell phone to see if he'd meet me at the airport instead of
going back to Jeffrey's, he'd be there within twenty minutes, he was so
happy to hear my voice and that I was back in town. So ecstatic to be
getting away from my life of servitude for the next few days, I was sourly
disappointed when I got off the phone. As if he'd been listening to my
entire conversation, Jeffrey told me he'd like a massage back at his place
and he could pay me at the same time for my trip with him. With much
dismay I had to call T.J back and cancel the arrangements, I wouldn't see
him until later that night, in which one of Jeffrey's staff would drive me
home and I would be too exhausted to do anything.
like minds. Jeffrey didn't want to know the grim details of how it all
happened on my intimate night with the Prince, he just asked simply if I
thought that I did well in keeping his friend happy. Knowing already that
the evaluation of my performance I gave was already discussed between
them, I just as simply replied back with a nod of approval. Though I did
have a laugh with Jeffrey about the Prince's weird fixation on my feet
and lets just say that he was quite tickled with Andrew's quirky
obsession, having a good ol'chuckle at my eccentric encounter. I was
paid extremely well this time, putting my money earned into nothing but
popping pills and alcohol by shouting my so called friends a good time,
aiming for the attempt to forget about my experiences abroad. I partied
like that to feel young again, my age and most of all to self-anesthetize
my troubles from within. It wasn't like I was waiting for someone to
arrive on his white horse and take me away to a magical world. I simply
yearned for more out of life than being someone's replaceable
amusement. Still a romantic at heart I would often get lost in my
daydreams, imagining a new beginning with a strong man that would
show me an enduring love, safety in his arms, and a lifetime friendship.
Though the suggestion of true loves existence was only a dream for now,

goal of keeping me at his side as his personal amusement that he could
lend out at anytime. Further proving his capability of using the vulnerable
impressions of a young girl to influence and intimidate his fellow peers of
romantic notions would be absurd in Jeffrey's eyes. For some unknown
reason to me he couldn't allow himself to give love or receive someone's
heart in return. Once he said to me when I asked him if he ever thought
he would settle down and find Mrs. Right and he told me he didn't
believe that love with one monogamous partner was possible but he
found that love with many was. I thought at the time it had something to
do with having so much money and everyone wanting him for that
instead of seeing him as a person and even felt bad for him, but now I can
understand from his recent lessons unlearned that it was a simple
equation of his twisted perversion to become infatuated with the
vulnerable youth off the streets. Spending so much time in the entrapment
of Jeffrey's embrace, I was becoming numb to the feelings and aspiration
to ever climb above this deep hole I had dug myself into. I knew I wanted
to escape from this bizarre form of first class slavery but I still didn't
have the tools necessary to help me get out. How could I have? Everyone

complicated battle within myself, it is one I still ache to fully comprehend
today.
Sunny spring days melted away the ice off the frozen streets of New
York and the harsh winter winds begun to gently blow away the dead
leaves, making the caged trees appear to have some form of life again. I
hated the cold winters there, it would only add to my depression being
locked indoors. Give me hot Florida days blistering in the sun where I
can swelter by a cool pool and sip cocktails with pieces of fruit and little
oriental umbrella's floating around. What a vision of solace? Looking
around my extravagantly decorated mid-evil room I was reminded of the
desolation that I was more than accustomed too. Knowing it wouldn't be
long before I was summoned again for another ritualistic occurrence in
fornicating with my master, I hardly bothered to leave my assigned
chambers, scarcely being sent home for a moments break, I just accepted
my fate. As I predicted the intercom buzzed momentarily and I heard
Ghislane's voice come over and request to meet them in Jeffrey's study.
Not an odd call, I would often meet him there first so he could tie up
some unfinished business before heading to the dungeon, or what was
thought to be the massage room. Making my way down the hall, I had an
eerie feeling wash over me, as if I had several pairs of eyes on me.
watching my every move. A cold chill moved up my spine and I had to
move my thoughts elsewhere, too easy behind these walls to succumb to
my fearsome anxieties. I punched in number one once inside the elevator
and it took me down to the floor where Jeffrey and his surprise guest
were waiting with anticipation behind closed doors. I cracked open the
heavy wooden doors and a familiar face revealed itself. Definitely not
expected or pre-warned on my part but I already knew what he was here
for or at least why I was called down to the study. Prince Andrew had
that notorious cheesy grin slapped over his face, as he looked me up and
down like a shiny new car on display and he was about to take it for a test
drive. Ghislane led me to the decadent sofa he was lounging on and
twirled me around to give him a good lookover before sitting me down on
his lap. Like a show pony I knew exactly how they wanted me to be
paraded around, with the last of my dignity long lost, I had nothing more
to lose. It was easy to give them the reaction they desired, all I had too do
encounters with Jeffrey's "staff" but I led the way anyways, as if he was
now my guest of honor. Entering into the dim room it took a few minutes
for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but knowing my way around the
room was enough to find the shower. I turned on the steam room and
began to undress myself. Andrew followed my lead and disrobed,
throwing his attire to the floor. I wanted to run and hide feeling his hands
touch me again, but my servitude for Jeffrey kept me there. Getting out of
his stronghold I turned my attention to the steam filling up and tried to
turn his attention to the marble bench where I suggested he take a seat
while I rubbed his feet. By the look in his eyes I knew he could care less
about a foot massage, his real desires were being shown by the arousal
his body was forming. He indicated where he wanted me to touch him
and how, I fulfilled his seedy requests, but only just. There was no
pleasure in this for me, the only thing I derived from this event was to
sink further into my slumber of depression. I couldn't remember a time
when I felt needed for anything other than my body or amusements
thereof. After his massage was thoroughly conducted I couldn't wait to
get back to my room for another shower. Sitting on the floor of the
shower under the harsh spray of water, I scrubbed my body where he

being on coke and pills, not only was my mentality dwindling away but
also my looks. I sure as hell didn't feel like a seventeen year old anymore
and now I wasn't looking like one. My eyes had dark circles underneath
them from not sleeping and my bones protruded from my skinny
waistline and chest. This made Jeffrey apprehensive in keeping me
around as often and before I had a moments notice, I was out of money
and looking for a job. When I questioned him what was happening, he
told me I wasn't the same girl he had first met some time ago now and
looked like I needed a break from working so much. " I'll call you next

this in every possible way. Even though a week's wages for working a
full-time job as a waitress didn't come close to the money I had made in a
couple hours of working for Jeffrey, I was happier than I had been in a
long time. I made some friends at my new job and found my duties to be
easy and pleasant. I was good at making customers smile and keeping
them happy becoming the waitress that made the most tips for the night,
which in turn made my co-workers happy since we'd all split the tips at
the end of the week. For the first time in a long time I had boys my age
hitting onto me, and not that I was ever taken aback by there attempts but
it reminded me of how it felt to be around a younger crowd. I missed so
much of what I couldn't get back and the more I tasted it, the more I
remembered how to smile. The relationship between T.J and I began to
falter in a way that was beyond reconciliation. Fights became physical
and I saw sides to him that only pushed me away more. He refused to
look for work to help pay bills and he became utterly frustrated not
having his usual cocktail of assorted drugs to keep him from feeling
anything at all. He didn't like the fact I was growing inside and thinking
beyond his elusive world. I had gone through too much to accept another
form of abuse and degradation. Making that point very clear to him by

While out doing the grocery shopping one evening I couldn't help but
stop at the local pet store and fell in love with a furry pooch. She was a
Japanese Chow-Chow and a bundle of fur that more resembled a baby
brown bear than a dog. I took her home with me and instantly she became
my best friend. We went for several walks a day and she bore the brunt of
many tear filled conversations, she was my loyal companion who
understood more than anyone had before, all I really need was someone
to listen and funny enough it was her that filled that hole.
Nearly three months had gone by and not a word from Jeffrey or
Ghislane. With T.J out of the picture now too all I had to concentrate on
Obviously mentally distorted from whatever choice of drugs he was
smoking that night. He screamed down my apartment complex, going
mad and scaring my neighbors I felt like I had no choice but to let him
inside. I tried talking to him as a good friend would, just wanting him to
see what he was doing to himself and what he had become. Part of me
still loved him and took pity on watching him spiral downwards. Taking
him back into my life was not a decision I made whole-heartedly, but was
something I did out of guilt and what I thought was loyalty. He moved his
clothes back to my place, which was all he ever owned anyways and we
tried to pick up the broken pieces. T.J being still badly addicted to many
drugs, I had to be very careful where I kept my jewelry and expensive
items. I decided to rent out a space at a local spot and store my cherished
items away, just taking the necessary precautions, I thought.
Still not working I knew how he was scraping by money and I didn't
agree with it, T.J was a known thief and had been caught several times
attempting to steal things, even as stupid as DVD's and PS2 or Xbox
games from a local Blockbuster. He even stole from his parents, his sister
and his brother and would probably steal a piece of candy from a five

and headed to my car with T.J in tow. For the rest of the night he was
oddly quiet and asked to be dropped off at his parent's house, I was more
than obliged to do so. I couldn't stand the sight of him let alone want to
be around him tonight. Being so revved up it didn't yet dawn on me that
something wasn't right. The next morning I was woken up by an alerting
phone call, I had the manager from the restaurant where I worked, on the
other end screaming at me and asking where the money is. I sat up in bed,
completely awake now, and asked him back, "What are you talking
about, what money?" His tone had calmed a bit and he could hear the
earnestly in my voice and explained his accusations 'The tip jar was
empty after you had left last night and there was over a hundred and fifty
dollars in there, now it's missing". The answer hit me instantly and I got
a terrible knot in my stomach...T.J. When I left him at the bar not even
thinking about the tip bowl to talk with the manager, he saw an
opportunity to fund more drugs and he took it. That's why he didn't even
want to come back to my apartment last night. It was all too clear for me
now and I tried to explain to my manager about my boyfriend's sickness
and asked him to take the lost money out of my wages. "I have no choice
but to let you go and file a police report for the missing money". I
couldn't believe what I was hearing. How did things turn upside down so
quickly? I exclaimed "Even though I'm paying you from my pocket for
money I didn't even steal and you've never even had any problems from
me before?". His apologies were short and icy, nothing that could be
done. I slammed down the receiver only to pick it up again to dial T.J's
parents house and to no surprise he hadn't slept there last night and was
not able to be reached. I felt like I was in a bad dream I couldn't wake up
from and with no money to pay rent, eat, or even survive, I was back to
the drawing board.
The week passed without hearing from T.J, he was in hiding, for now.
When the phone rang early one morning I expected it to be him, instead it
was a surprise phone call from a familiar voice. Jeffrey decided to give
me a call to invite me over to his Palm Beach mansion for some lunch
and to catch up, it really was just his way of finding out if I was cleaned

phone call. She zlanced up quickly and gave a brisk wave my way, then
cabana, which was Jeffrey's office, & gym, Jeffrey took a seat behind his
desk and told me to have a seat across from him. He took a sip of water
from an already poured glass and asked if I'd like some. "Yes, Thank
you" My reply was short and polite, already just wanting to get this
meeting done and over with. His face was like steel and his expressions
were stern, I felt like a child in trouble sitting in the principles office.
He cut straight to the chase wanting to know "Are you on drugs
anymore?" There was a moment's pause as 1 took a deep breath and told
him the entire truth. "I got really depressed for awhile and coped with my
emotions by blanketing them with mind-altering substances. Just smoking
a jay to relax wasn't good enough anymore. I needed to be high and

sorrows with an overflow of endorphins, making it possible to keep up

repeating itself
He listened to me continue to tell him about the good things that have
come from the break. Like my dog, yoga, and working at a restaurant,
making lots of new friends but most of all, I got my smile back, without
the drugs this time. He was really happy to hear the upside of everything,
but there was one thing I was reluctant to tell him about. My recent
travail that T.J effortlessly caused at the restaurant where I was so happily
employed. As my manager had warned he had to file a police report

Nodding my head in concurrence I went on to finish my epic drama. "I
received a phone call from the PBCP asking me to come in about the
money, I told them what happened over the phone but they still want me
to come in. I don't want to have a record for something I never did or

Pulling a few tissues out of the box, he passed them across the desk to
me. Trying to retract any damage done I said to him "1 must look like
such a mess to you and making you listen to my saga, I am so sorry... I
shouldn't have come to you with all of this." He looked surprised and
sympathetic "Quite the opposite actually. I'm glad you've come to me for
help. I have got a lot of connections especially with the Palm Beach
County Police Department. I give them regular hundred thousand dollar
donations, and after I speak with them there will be nothing more to
worry about. To be honest I'm more in shock about how much can
happen to you in such a short time, your life is one big soap opera"
Now he was chuckling and trying to make light of my somber mood.
Laughing along too I replied, " I know right? Drama just hangs around
me like a bad smell". We did some more light-hearted catching up and
went out to the poolside for some lunch and a swim, concluding the
evening with an erotic massage upstairs. He paid me the usual two
hundred dollars and asked me to come back tomorrow. "In the meantime
I don't want you thinking about your sticky situation, consider it dealt

Chapter 14
As was promised I never heard back from the Police Department and
Jeffrey had his favorite girl back by his side. We picked up where we left
off ever better than before, I being entirely subservient to every sexual
desire of his engaging myself in any role he wanted me to play. As he
was getting older his appetite for sex never hazed, if anything it only
increased. The orgies with other girls got larger in numbers and his
appeal to younger girls, new toys and wilder nights expanded from once
and awhile to quite an often occurrence in Jeffrey's company. I put it
down his new friend and business investment, Jean-Luc Brunel.
A long time agent for young and upcoming models, Brunel, a French
citizen, was known for roaming the world in search of young, naive
beauties living in poverty stricken countries and willing to do just about
anything for money. He would procure them mostly from Clubs in South
America and the Former Soviet Republic. Filling their heads with
fairytales of America and large amounts of money, he would promise
them all of the finer things in life, sometimes even throwing a pill in their
drink, if that meant getting them in his bed was becoming too much of a
task. What he wanted is what he got, which is why him and Jeffrey
ultimately became close pals and he invested one million dollars into
Brunel's company. In return Jeffrey now had supply of girls on tap for
With the assistance of each other, Brunel obtaining the illegitimate
visas for underage-overseas girls and Jeffrey housing them at his
brother's apartment complex on 301 E 66" St, Manhattan, they were
quite the team. Jeffrey and Brunel would charge them for rent, forcing
them to work for them selling their bodies for money, nude pictures, and
even pornography. These were what seemed like really nice people with
not so nice intentions setting an impression of how the dignified wealth
play and behind closed doors they had as much civilized manners as a
barbaric chimpanzee in heat. Giving a girl a step-up in finances by
teaching them there only worth is what lay between their legs, us girls all
were the same in the end, regardless of what country we came from, what
language we spoke or our cultural indifferences, we all were being used
for one thing alone, our youthful looks and beautiful bodies.
Being Jeffrey's permanent sidekick, I would have to part-take in a
many of the hedonistic exploitations that went on at one of his many
residences, which meant having to be uninhibited with many girls my age
and younger. Being complete strangers was hard enough but we couldn't
even understand each other, speaking in different tongues we were
expected to excel at preforming many acts of lovemaking and foreplay on
each other, while being observed by a man in a corner jerking off. Not
exactly what 1 would call an advantage in my stage of life, but in my head
I was convinced we all had to do what we had to do to get on with life
and if that meant doing all of this to keep Jeffrey happy, then I would do
It didn't take long in the accompaniment of Brunel for Jeffrey to hit an
all time low, at least one that I knew about. Stupid enough or sick
enough, I don't know which one it is or both but Jeffrey bragged about
his birthday present from Brunel, once accepting three, twelve year old
girls, sisters at that. He replayed the descriptive events with me telling me
how they all massaged him and finished him off orally. He was so excited
about the entire event, replaying over and over again over the next course
of weeks how cute they were and how you could tell they were really
young by the small amount of hair growth in their pubic region and non-

absolutely brilliant how easily money seduced all walks of life...nothing
or no one that couldn't be bought in his eyes. Behind the two of them
followed a destructive trail of those in their path that were misused,
violated, degraded in a variety of ways for one purpose... to satisfy the
desires of the perversion that rotted their hearts.
The next couple of months I spent in Jeffrey's company, my life was
revolved around him and his petty happiness. Arising to the occasion, I
was no longer his teenage sidekick, I was growing into being a young
woman and my body was blossoming like never before. Out of the
awkward stages of my life, I now took to looking after myself like never
before. Regular sessions in tanning beds and keeping fit became my life
outside of Jeffrey. He kept telling me what a beautiful woman I was
developing into and would offer suggestions to help me look good.
Sending me to dentists for regular teeth whitening consultations or
helping me choose my attire for the evening, he was ushering me into a
whole new position, training me up for something else, but I was unsure
Being a snotty little teenager was a girl of the past. Now I had to be his
eloquent speaking, desirable to all and almost his personal porcelain doll.
I went everywhere with him again, all of his eclectic dinner parties,
conferences, and meetings with various members of parliament, famous
celebrities, and other esteemed billionaires...most of whom lived by the
same rule of thumb as Jeffrey did. Quite an alarming realization having to
accept this world the way it is. Jeffrey knew all of the right people in this
game, and trading girls for favors is how he kept in the circle. He was at
the center of it all, blackmail being the only thing next to money with the
ability to pull a many of strings, his conniving ulterior motive was to drag
al that he could down to i his a varuse tries easily embrice
out the assortment of young girls and pass them around like they were
cocktails on a platter. No girl had a choice in whom they went with, only
completing a task, we would have to charm and bedazzle these ageing fat
men who other than paying for it would've never had a shot at getting to
know a beautiful girl intimately. I personally belonging to Jeffrey rarely
had to be loaned out and it was a big occasion. or should I say favor, if I
was. I'll never really know what made me so important or special to
Jeffrev, it definitely had nothing to do with love. I ruess in the end I will
always put it down to my capability of being whomever he wanted when
he wanted, so compliant it just made it easy for him to have a personal
toy at his constant disposal. All I can say is I lived in a jail with no bars,
and in a country where slavery was supposedly abolished a long time ago
but still existed right underneath everybody's noses. Myself and so many
other girls were walking proof of it.
I still was given proper training in massage therapy from time to time,
keeping me from looking back at being a teenager with no responsibilities
to being a young adult with prospering titles. He knew I wanted to be self-
sufficient so bad I would do anything for it and by giving me this dream
to hold to only kept me in check. I looked forward to my training
sessions, holding onto every word passed down to me and after the
session was complete I would hurry back to my room and transfer the
information into a workbook with associating exercises.
Trying my new moves on Jeffrey always impressed him, he would get
excited hearing about my passion for knowledge and would tell me he
could see it transfer into my massages, always giving it my all, my hands
were a focused energy when I was at work. Using every ounce of strength
to apply on a body, many were astounded in what I could do for being
such a small girl, and Jeffrey loved it, using me for a two-hour massage
"with benefits" sometimes being over twice a day. Ghislane would
sometimes use me to massage her still but it wasn't as common, she
preferred a man for that job.
Then would come the odd client here and there, of course set up by
Jeffrey. Most of which were orchestrated to get beautiful girls
comfortable and consequently naked then he would go in for the kill, so
to speak, touching them intimately, in their most private of places like
their vagina, breasts or anal. When he had us where he wanted, willing
and able, then would come the toys, outfits and so on. A scheme he has
used time and time again, telling those who know him well "he had never
been turned down yet". It was starting to dawn on me how I wasn't
getting any clientele that weren't used for Jeffrey's benefit and would
make me wonder if I just wasn't good enough for that, but I kept quiet,
never wanting to make waves like I had before.
To give me a break from it all as if Jeffrey didn't want to overload me
again, he would send me away to his ranch for a few days, what he knew
I considered being a small slice of heaven on earth. I'd spend my days
roaming the hills, riding horses, and enjoying the solitude of my own
company. One afternoon I was out exploring the land on Jeffrey's ranch

saw on paper. I would paint anything beautiful that caught me eyes

vibrant colors and emotion on display but my favorite soon became the
landscape of the Santa Fe's rolling hills and earthly green and beige tones
and in certain light it would illuminate into a golden shine. To grasp that
feeling I was absolved in at the hardest of times became my greatest inner-

achievement, like taking a piece of that serenity and putting on paper for
me to keep in my heart where it still is today, closing my eyes I am able
to see it, being there anytime I need to. I was enjoying the heat and taking
in the deserts sights when I stumbled off the track and into the
wilderness. Exploring everything new to me was my second nature and
never even entered my mind what would've happened if I went too far or
got lost. I would rather face Mother Nature's wrath than humankind's any

looking like the remnants of an old pueblo made out of clay and rock. I
picked up what looked like half of a clay bowl and noted that it had
Indian designs etched into the side of it. Excited about my findings I
decided to do some more exploring around the fields surrounding the
historic site. I collected rare pieces of arrowheads, utensils, and parts of
many broken bowls with artwork telling tales of their own. Time was of
no essence here and before I even realized the sun had sunk deeper into
the hills leaving me without any light to find my way back to the
pathway. Feeling silly now after passing by a familiar looking boulder
twice over, I was startled when I heard some poor animal become dinner

directom of vetrey mansion was mision, so roieved in the ind and
so were the housemaids after I hadn't showed up for dinner, assuming I
must've been out for one of my usual adventures. I went to bed
strenuously exhausted that night and as I was falling asleep the phone
rang, it was a call from Jeffrey who had been alerted of my
disappearance. "What happened tonight, one of the maids called me to
tell me you hadn't come back from your walk this evening" Detecting a
tone of anger in his voice I tried to distract him by telling him of my
findings and he scolded me for being gone for so long without anyone
knowing where I was. Going back to the Indian remnants, I persisted on
telling him what I had found. In the end he was iust worried about me
becoming a liability, but had to make it sound as if he cared. " Don't
worry Jeffrey, I won't be doing that again. I can honestly say I have
learned my lesson and the next time I want to explore I promise to take
someone with me". I satisfied his worry of me being a future nuisance
could become a sight for historical preservation and that means the
government could ultimately own my land."
I acknowledged his request and told them they were just a gift for my
Mom, who was in love with Indians "Wait until she see's I brought her
back real artifacts, she is going to totally freak out." He didn't mind that I
was taking them. In fact he admired my curiosity and adventurous spirit.
He reminded me that tomorrow was my last day. I would be driven to the
Albuquerque International Airport the day after next, to meet Jeffrey in
New York, for how long, only he knew. Giving Jeffrey many thanks for a
great week, letting him know how much I appreciated these small breaks
away, we then said goodnight. Hanging up the phone I had caught my
second wind and set out to the kitchen to find a late-night snack. Raiding
the fridge and pantry, I found some frozen pizzas and popcorn. I put on a
movie and munched on the popcorn while the pizza cooked. Some 1980's
dreadful alien flick got the better of me that night. It was based on a true
story about people abductions from extraterrestrial beings, which were,
like I was, visiting a remote area. I suddenly hated being alone on a ranch
in the middle of nowhere. I munched down my burnt, crunchy pizza and
became further enveloped in the thick plot. Leaving on the TV and the

Living through the night was a relief and I laughed at myself in the
moming, how spooked did I get? When I got to New York, Jeffrey, and
Ghislane had a good laugh over my tale of survival in the wilderness and
then the alien scare. "Your always having the best adventures" Ghislane
exclaimed. We were similar in that way, both being s bit of free spirits it

poked fun at me, her usual fun past time. Our relationship was an odd
one, never threatened by each other but always precautious towards one
another nonetheless able to crack a joke together, but when it came time
to "work" it was no fun and games, she was intensely serious. "With a
sense of humor like yours I would tend to think that you are the one from
another blanet." Just friendly banter between the two of us, then Jeffrey
had to jump in with his two bits, "I think you might be onto something
Ghislane. " I squinted my eyes and gave them both an exaggerated death
stare and pretended to grab my stomach in pain, "I think some things
trying to get out of me", putting my fist in my shirt to reenact a scene
from Alien, I fell onto the couch and faked my death. "I knew it"

all broke out into laughter. It was those fun times that made me feel like
we were all apart of this really perplexed family. We did everything
together similar to normal families like eat dinner, watch TV, and travel it
was only the hedonistic and corrupt side to these two deviates that made
them a peculiar pair.
Getting turned on at the two of us playing together, Jeffrey came over
to the couch we were on and pulled down his sweatpants revealing his
erect manhood. All of the laughter stopped, now it was time for work.
Pushing my head into his pubic region I had to give into his perverted
wants. Ghislane started to undress me. Once I was bare she loved starting
with my breasts. She cupped them in her hands and brushed her fingers
over my hardened nipples heading downwards pressing her lips deeply
into my skin, I had to maneuver my body on the couch in a complex
position to give them both what they wanted. And just like that, without
even a moment's notice I could be put on the spot and have to amuse
them in any way they wanted. A shameful way to make someone feel like
a used toy, I wasn't around for companionship I was there for one thing, I
was a compliant piece of eye candy.
Twenty minutes later and Jeffrey had erupted in pleasure. Ghislane sat
up, still fully dressed, and wiped the sides of her mouth with her hands,
riving a vindictive little chuckle, "That was fun." Jeffrey concurred with
a sly grin arching his back for a stretch just looking able to utter the
request "Why don't you come up with me upstairs for a steam bath and
massage, I need to be loosened up after that?" It was more of a statement
than a request, as if I had the choice to say "No thanks, I'm actually tired
myself and would love to just relax" instead I would reply with my
accustomed trained obedience, "No problem, when your ready lead the
way." I had to get dressed again being that we were in Ghislane's
downstairs office. Putting my clothes back on, Ghislane thought she had
buttered him up just where she wanted him to ask for him to come have a
look at her new townhouse renovations when he was finished with his
massage. A very strange relationship those two have, there's a definite
love flowing between them but not a passionate one, more like a
respectful business, he gets what he wants... an uncountable number of
girls and she gets what she wants, simple and sweet... an uncountable
amount of money. The two things in life that can create such beautiful
moments or the most horrendously terrible of them all. is sex and money.
Chapter 15
I joined him for a shower, steam bath and concluded his needs with a
massage while listening to classical music. I knew he didn't want
anything sexual from me now seeing he got what he already wanted
downstairs, no this one was purely therapeutic. My favorite massages to
give, making me feel like an actual real therapist. I lathered him in
aromatic oils and let my hands discover the ways to unlock the stresses
that his body held. After the massage was concluded we were going
downstairs to get ready to go see Ghislane's townhouse as he had
promised her earlier. He loved taking the hidden staircase while I hated it.
I was so creeped out by his choice of décor, the blood red carpets, violent
medieval paintings, and sculptures of the pagan god Pan, all of it
representing the darker side of hedonism his lifestyle provoked. Spiraling
down the hallway along with each step you took came with a pair of eyes
that followed your every step. Brown, blue, green, hazel, all of the colors
were there, staring at you the entire way down. As each step progressed,
so would my anxiety to get out of there.
We found Ghislane where we had left her, in her office. She had just
received an order in, a satellite camera with a twelve-inch flat screen. She
told us how it was used to pick up any person in any location with the
quick insert of an address. Quite a powerful new toy I thought, but it was
only a minute display of what the rich could afford, what use they would
get out of it was another concern. Soon after she was done figuring out
the controls on the camera, we made a rare and first for me pit stop, the
security room. What I thought was our way out by the front door was
another hidden door. I was in shock as I was led into a room, so discreet
that in three years I never even knew it existed. I kept my head down
most of the time, knowing how secretive this must be being another door
was an entire security base within his mansion. What I could see when I
stole a glimpse here and there was an array of tiny screens, twenty odd or
something. Small screens showing various rooms of the mansion I had
recognized. The images were constantly changing so I found it hard to
pinpoint an exact location but from the décor and short glimpses I
suddenly knew from then on that my feelings of my every move being
watched inside his corridors was now more than a possibility but was
actually happening. Jeffrey spoke to an obese Spanish guy at the desk,
whose job was to disgustingly overlook all of the video feedback. Kill
two birds with one stone Jeffrey thought, free porn to share with all of his
pedophile friends and when the occasion called for it, a security system
all at one expense. Ever consumed with making money as well as saving
it, I was again astonished at Jeffrey's capabilities. I didn't want to even
think how deep the video infiltrated, pretending like I never saw anything
at all I put the memory to the back of my mind and went on about my
day. Stopping at Ghislane's new townhouse, another gift bought and paid

for by Jeffrey, he pointed out needed changes all over the place, driving
the builders mad, as always. He wanted the place to scream out
"GHISLANE" with a bold statement. Checkered floors and bold colors
was the theme, like the queen of hearts from Alice in Wonderland, very
well suited I thought.
The dust from the walls being torn down chocked my throat and the
elevator was not in use, the stairs were hardly either. The whole house
was in bad shape then having to go up three flights of rickety steps was a
bit of a risk too but worth it once you made it to her future walk in
wardrobe or to us commoners, a closet the size of a small a house.
Complete with a dressing room, luxurious bathroom and plenty of storage
for her every ensemble. Even without it being finished it was already a
work of art, a sanctuary for any woman. She adorned herself in her future
home, finally her own, relishing every inch of it, she already put in a
work desk and spoke constantly of its ongoing renovations. About an
hour later we were off to pick out curtains and look at some paint samples
at a couple different boutique looking shops. Easily passing off as an
ordinary couple for the day, they walked arm in arm strolling the streets
of the Upper East Side. Except to me, still replaying the early afternoon's
events, shaking my head over the echoed images in my mind, I followed
behind just waiting to be needed again.
Over the course of the next few months was a constant influx of
exorbitant excursions at Jeffrey's mansions, mainly to his island, to keep

time would stop my memories from flowing back, rehabilitate my
problems and relax me enough to deal with any situation at hand, no
matter what the circumstance revealed itself to be. It was a drug that
would blind my eyes to everything I should've been running from.
Having Brunel always in the picture these days wasn't helping me at all
either. Sending his girls for Jeffrey at all of his places now and at a
vigorous flow, they had an abundance of girls at their disposal. If I were
to count one girl for everyday of the week, it would be the
underestimated statement of the century. So many girls between the two
of them, some nights it would be a free for all frenzy for Jeffrey and
Brunel, seven or so girls giving them their upmost attention, doting on
their every moan and whimper, Jeffrey being the main concern since
Brunel worked for him and we were all aware of that too. If there were
heaven on earth for men like Jeffrey, than he would be their God. Every
one of his inner most desires was fulfilled when his harem of women was
waund. No wonder he do's travel couch a relic veche day was he ever
asking me to bring girls to him as well. There was never enough girls to
fill his appetite, so on occasion I would meet a pretty girl around my age
and invite her back to his place to make some quick money by offering
her a really good contact in the modeling and acting business. Keeping
him satisfied and in need of me was a tiring job. With so much
competition I had to be on the ball, seeming ambitious to grant him all of
his desires. It was a lot of pressure and a spotlight of a role to undertake
at such a young age but I told myself this is what my life's training had
My Birthday was around the corner and turning eighteen had lost all of
its sparkle and pizzazz. There were no more surprises in store for me,
nothing that would bedazzle me I hadn't done already. I spent my
birthday on the island, having a quiet dinner and watching "Sex and the
City" on the couch with Jeffrey, Ghislane and Emmy. There was no cake
or a celebration of any sort but I did get a couple of presents that I opened
outside underneath the main cabana. Jeffrey gave me a beautiful pair of
sapphire and diamond encrusted earrings and Ghislane bought me another
designer makeup case. I thanked the two of them with a tight squeeze and
a gratuitous short spiel. As it went quiet, I looked out to the ocean and
wondered if across these waters was there ever going to be happier days
speny sit here when niel to him Mold her be id end up scrane and
my final bit of training, a marriage to a greedy old scrooge? Either way
what I wanted most didn't matter right now, I was still bound by Jeffrey's
hold over me and all I had to keep telling myself to get through this epic
journey was, this is just the way it was for now.
Around the table for breakfast Jeffrey announced that he was expecting
a few guests coming over with Brunel, no one of importance, just his
usual entourage of beautiful girls. Russian models this time and Jeffrey
was also having a photographer flown in to take modeling photos using
the island as the perfect background for a sexy shoot. All of us girls were
ushered onto rocks, hammocks, dug into sand and displayed just about
anywhere they wanted. We were being photographed in next to nothing,
like a netted fabric placed over us if the shot called for it, but the more
provocative the more Jeffrey and Brunel loved it.
After the photo shoot we did some outdoor watersports. While us girls
raced the jet skis around and jumped on the water trampoline, the men
stayed on dry land to watch us from the beach. I was so used to this
constant charade of girls and I didn't mind having a bit of fun but this
was different, I had to be more than just polite because I already knew it
wouldn't be long before we were all intimate with each other as well.
Being the only girl that spoke English out of all of them was also a huge
blunder. The only way we could communicate was through hand gestures

and body language, a very primitive form of speaking, but what choice
I did my best to get acquainted and as I had previously assumed after
lunch on the beach we were again ushered into another part of the island,
Jeffrey's cabana. There was no need for words here, as the girls already
knew exactly what to do. Without saying anything they undressed me and
began to ravage my body with their hands, tongues, lips and fingers. I
was delirious, never having done anything like this before with so many
girls. It was sheer chaos; I don't honestly know how men could fantasize
over this. Through the glimpses in between bodies crossing over me I
could see Jeffrey and Brunel watching us, sitting in a chair with their
hands around their penises, stroking themselves together 'The best part is
they don't even speak English so there's never a need to have to keep
them amused" I could hear one of the men divulge and pretty sure it came
from Jeffrey laughing out loud to Brunel. I just closed my eyes and went
somewhere else in my mind until it was all over. That was that, life went
on and we all moved on to eat dinner together.
It couldn't be more awkward as Jeffrey and Brunel were beside
themselves with their ego's beaming, and the girls chatted like busy little
chile were win ached at eire radet aroun he there and ofte
there was me. Sitting quietly and smiling in people's direction when
needed, I was counting down the minutes until I could go lay down in my
giant comfortable bed, slipping away to the gentle noises the island
created and sink comfortably into a deep sleep with the assistance of my
Xanax. Scratching at the plate in front of me with my fork out of
boredom, I wasn't even hungry. I had lost my appetite for food. Rather
sipping on the champagne I wanted to feel as far away from here as
possible. What seemed like hours for everyone to finish their meals we
were finally all saying goodnight and goodbye to each other, as Brunel
was off early in the morning and taking the eight beauties with him.
'Thank God" I told myself, once was more than I could handle of that in
It didn't take me long to get back into my own comfort zone. Heading
straight back to my cabana after dessert was served nearly tripping over
my own two feet as I tried to scuttle off in a hurry. As soon as I entered
my domain, I drew a breath and sighed a deep exhale outwards, finally
alone and at peace... for now at least. Although the sun had set hours ago
the high temperatures of the Caribbean were still an affliction, plaguing
my cabana 1 was welcomed by a rush of warm air as I opened the door. I
hit the switch to the fan and strived down for a shower. Preparing my
towel and toiletries I opened the back door to the outside shower and
placed them on the floor. Whether I was cleaning up in the midst of a hot
day or retiring for the evening, an outside shower was always splendid.
Under a thick dark cloak of the night sky only the moon and stars to shed
enough light for me to see my way around. I could feel the soft breeze
lick the droplets falling off of my bodies' curves in the reflection of the
moonlight. It only encouraged me to stay longer under the warmth from
the spray of rushing water. I let the hot water run out before I was
sufficed enough to go back inside. Lounging around the bed in my
panties and a tank top I was still sweltering from the heat. Trying to tire
myself out, I did some reading and eventually fell asleep. I needed those
times to unwind after such an ordeal, letting the Xanax wash away all of
the pain I could then forgive the mistakes I had made, blaming myself for
staying around for this I had wished I was never born at all. The pills
would take all of that away for me. My heart was a tangled weave of
deception and pain, only reassured by the lies that were told to me and the
lies I would have to convince myself of.
Chapter 16
When we flew back into Palm Beach, Juan drove me back to my
apartment. Lonely for some companionship I decided to call an old
friend. I was longing to be important to someone and unfortunately with
such little time to have a social life of my own I was compelled to call T.J
again. His Mom answered the phone and sounded quite surprised to hear
my voice on the other end. She was always kind to me, I even used to
bring her back "Cola" cans from other countries a bizarre hobby she
loved collecting. She just didn't know what I saw in her son, even saying
that to his face many times over. Not blind to his ways of cheating and
stealing, being a personal victim of it, she made it apparent that she did
not approve of T.J's choice in lifestyle. It used to really hurt him how his
parents thought so badly of him, so he gave up trying to earn their love a
long time ago. As long as he didn't steal from them anymore he was
allowed to live there. Instead of that being a lesson to him, he would just
try to be more clever in what he would steal, less obvious things. He
would steal the toaster and sell it for five dollars if he knew it would help
to get him his next high.
Nonetheless and at my expense I had a sweet spot for him. With
enough water under the bridge, I was able to forget about the troubles he
caused. His Mom told me she'd pass on the message when he got home,
but that could be days from now. The last time he had been home was
over a couple of weeks now. He only stopped by to get something to eat,
have a long sleep and to beg her for a few bucks, supposedly to help him
buy food. Then he was off again without a single word said, only leaving

his parents to their own assumptions, which were pretty much correct
anyways.
I then called around a couple of mutual friends to see if anyone had
heard from him. Everyone I spoke to pointed their fingers in the same
direction and the worst place possible, Ritchie's house. One of his best
friends told me of how bad he was doing, "He's not the same guy
anymore, and all he cares about is the next high he gets. If we don't get
anything for him he just loses it and goes off somewhere." It was hard to
hear how badly affected my best friend was and a part of me secretly
hoped they weren't right. Still defending him, I told everyone I had spoke
too while trying to find him that T.J would be fine, he's just probably
going through a bad phase, like we all do sometimes and needs people to
have his back more than ever now. I was pretty much laughed at on the
spot, most people that I considered my friends at the time were only
friends by association. As long as we all looked the part, acted the part,
and could handle the part, only then did they want to be around us. The
last person I called was the last person I had hoped he wasn't with and it
turned out that everyone was right.
He was with one of the biggest Coke dealers in our area, Ritchie-Rich,
as everyone used to call him. He didn't look like a typical strung out
junkie or dealer. Instead he looked like your average preppy college grad
ith inspiries posing. He dressed ed a his dred and mic guy to
them out onto the streets. He was a businessman and his business was
thriving. He carried everything from most drugs to guns and knives.
Having ears in all places made him a dangerous acquaintance. Using kids
off the local Palm Beach streets to run his dirty errands and the errands of
the others above him, he made his money by using these teenagers, who
as hard as it was to believe was once somebodies sweet child
I knew T.J didn't have the finances to support himself or his drug habit
Marcus he asked me, "What do you want to call Ritchie for? Come over

judgment, never getting the hint or just not caring that I could never and

Adam is dead, what happened?" "Oh snaps, I thought you knew, where
have you been girl, under a rock or something?" Marcus was less than
sensitive about his statements. "He got shot in the head by two black guys
who got suspicious when their usual supplier didn't show up, your boy
T.J was so fucked up he didn't even remember to turn up at Ritchie's for
the delivery, so Ritchie sent Adam alone and now he's dead." Adam was
a sweet kid who just happened to be born living on the wrong block. Best
friends with T.J since childhood, the two were inseparable until puberty
hit and even then they would chase girls together. Adam followed in T.J's
every footstep, mimicking his shadow, if T.J jumped off the Eifel Tower
then so would Adam so when T.J got hooked on drugs consequently
Adam did too, leading ultimately to his death. Wanting to end the
conversation with Marcus quickly I scribbled down the phone number on
a blank piece of paper in front of me and hung up the phone to call
Ritchie's place immediately.
"Yeah?" It was Ritchie whom bluntly answered the phone after the first
ring. "Hi -Uh- Rich, It's Jenna, T.J's ex, we met a couple of times at a
few parties" I was trying to remind him of who I was knowing how
paranoid he was about people having his number. "Oh yeah, I know who
you are, what is it you want?" He answered with a dry tone. " 1 was
hoping you could tell me where I could find T.J, I've heard some stuff
and am really worried about him, is he alright?" Ritchie snickered at my
concerns. "What are you his Mom or something? He's fine, he should be
back here around five o'clock, P'Il tell him you called." In the middle of
me saying "Thanks and good-bye" he hung up the phone, as there is no
room for manners in his line of work. I waited until five o'clock watching
the minutes on the clock tick past and when five o'clock came and passed
by with still no phone call, I couldn't deny to myself that I wasn't
stricken with distress. Falling asleep wasn't easy either. I ended up
crashing out on my sofa watching T.V, half expecting to hear of another
murder on the news and it being T.J.
Forgetting to put on my eye mask before I went to bed, I was woken up
the next morning by rays of the sun beaming into my living room. When I
sleep I am a creature of darkness, avoiding any window light at all costs.
Staggering to the coffee pot not used to getting up this early, my first
thought that day was T.J and why he hadn't called. A million thoughts
rushed through my head like a steam train...is he ok? Is he not calling
because he is still mad from our last breakup? Has he moved on to
someone else? Is he in any trouble? Did Ritchie even pass on my
message? the their we ran endles inflicteen pum in my entire

Until finally he called my cell phone later in the afternoon, relief swept
over me when I heard his voice on the other end. "Thank God you called,
I have been so worried about you, are you alright?" I jumped in without
letting him get past saying "Hello". "Yeah, I'n fine. Ritchie told me you
called his house looking for me yesterday and gave me shit for it saying
you were upset or something, what's up?" I knew I would have to be
delicate about asking what happened to Adam, thinking he'd be a mess
over it. "I heard from Marcus that something happened to Adam and I got
worried about you, what is going on?" T.J sounded scared, for what
reasons were beyond my knowledge but I was going to find out, he
replied " I don't want to talk about it over the phone. Are you in town so
we can meet up or something?" It was obvious 1 wanted him to know that
I was more than willing to lend my shoulder for his problems. "I'm home
now if you want to come over whenever you feel like it." He didn't
hesitate in taking me up on the offer. " But I won't be able to get there

It was more of a request than a favor to myself which is what he was
making it out to sound like, knowing him all to well I didn't make a fuss
through the thin walls and trying to find the unit number was difficult
from the sporadic flickering of the fluorescent lights above me.
At last I found Ritchie's one, quite astonished with myself that I even
made it this far. I had to knock loudly on the door a few times before a
young girl answered the door with eyeliner bleeding down from her eyes,
her jet black hair was strung out and a mess and she looked off her face
on some hard drug. She had only her bra and a short skirt on to cover her
private areas and a cigarette hung out of her mouth to complete the full
picture of terrible state she was in. She looked me down with contempt
and snubbed at ne "What do you want?" I maintained my politeness and
told her T.J was expecting me. She opened the door and walked away,
leaving me by myself to venture through looking for T.J.
Passing through the kitchen it looked like a hospital lab with syringes on
the counter tops and medicine containers lying around everywhere.
Minding my steps through the dirty house, I walked to the back to the
living room and found T.J in a K-Hole strung out on a filthy couch.
"Hey.. there" he acknowledged me with a giant smile spread across his
face. He probably didn't even know who I was from the dreadful state he
was in. My first look at him in months and I was in utter shock. My jaw
downtown area. Rolling up my windows and locking the doors to my
truck I nervously drove through the rough streets trying to find Ritchie's
apartment complex. Knowing all too well the history of the area, it's not a
place a lone white girl in a nice truck wants to be seen, many reports of
the locals rushing up to a vehicles with a weapon demanding money,
cars, or just angry and out to hurt someone. I was speeding through the
streets wanting to get out of there as quick as I could. A sad world we live
in with so much hurt everywhere you look and nobody wanting to do
anything about it, just accepting the hopelessness of never being able to
achieve anything more than what our civilization has succumbed to.
Being among one of those people, we were similar in so many ways.
Only separated by our own personal fears and the different direction they
I drove straight through the open gates at the entrance to the complex
and parked on the gutter in front of Ritchie's block of units. A crowd of
people stood outside the blocks I was entering. Being hit on and offered
drugs simultaneously my cheeks went flush and I put my head down not
saying a word. Walking up the corridors of the staircase looked like a

of my imagination, filled my nostrils. I could hear babies screaming
"T.J, hey buddy its Jenna, remember I was coming to pick you up
today. You don't look so good, what are you doing so messed up?" I
don't think he could even understand what I was even saying because he
could only reply by giggling and rolling over, patting the couch as if it
were a fluffy animal. I stood over him now and raised my voice so he'd
know I was serious and snap out of it a bit. "Get Up T.J, Now!" I ushered
at him to get off the couch, repeating myself a few times over and with no
response 1 knew I had to get physical. Rolling him back over to face me
again I smacked his face hard and I'm sure it stung but I got the reaction 1
had wanted. He sat up and looked at me confused
At least now he was able to focus on my words requesting him to come
with me. He was getting up from the couch and stumbling around before
falling down to the floor again. Putting his arm around my neck and
carrying the majority of his weight, I helped him up many times over and
down three flights of stairs into my truck and drove him back to my
place. It was a triumph on it's own arriving downstairs in one piece.
Being the only person who really cared if T.J lived or died I felt like the
responsibility of helping him was my concern alone.
Thankfully Jeffrey was in Palm Beach for the next couple weeks
entertaining royalty, which gave me a little time to try and clean T.J up. I
called a few of his friends that I knew and asked them not to score any

drugs for him any more, pleading with them and telling all of them he
was on the brink of death, reminding them of the friendship between us
all that once existed before the drugs corrupted so many of us. Some of
them laughed at me telling me I was wasting my time with T.J and others
were nice enough to at least lie to my face politely and promise not to
help him feed his addiction.
I just wanted to remedy all of his pain and problems but I felt so
helpless fighting his battle against the streets. I bought some marijuana
for him to smoke hoping to subside the withdrawals he was facing over
the next few days but with no avail. The only thing that would help him
was my Xanax, a few of those pills and he would go back to sleep, only
waking up to get more of them. I would have to force him out of bed to
have a shower once a day and make sure he ate something. He was more
like a baby right now than he was a boyfriend, too much in need of
something I couldn't give.
Chapter 17
When I went to see Jeffrey over the next course of days he picked out
the dilemma I wore spread across my face straight away. "Your back with
T.J aren't you" It was so funny that he knew me so well. "Yeah, he's in a
real bad place in his life right now and needs my help." He looked
astonished and replied, "You're a much better friend than I am, I know
people like him and trust me they never change, no use in even trying" I
believed him too knowing I was stupid for even attempting to change T.J,
but my heart felt differently, he was still a human being and a good friend
of mine just down at his worst. "That's what good friends are for" I
laughed back at his remark, not wanting to take this conversation too
much further. " I admire your loyalty at least, but take my word for it, he
will hurt you again." His words were chilling but true, I had to find out
for myself though.
Almost seeming like an actual friend for a second he ruined his brief
momentary image by turning over from the unfinished massage that I was
giving to him and acquired his sexual longings from my worn down soul.
Not only did he know that I didn't want to endure any more demands
tonight. but his energy enhanced from knowing it too. Looking up at him
during the foreplay, it was an easy observation from the look in my eyes
that I hated every minute of it, seething through all of my duties until he
Most days I could take this kind of treatment, it was only seldom I
couldn't hold in the way Jeffrey disregarded my feelings. He had me just
where he wanted me, like a pawn piece on a checkers board I was his
own personal sex slave. For the remainder of the evening I stayed quiet,
not sure of what to say after an episode like that. It was a vigorous
display of how calumniating he could really be. He required me to clean
up his spilled semen off of his genitals with a wet warm washcloth before
he retired to his bedroom for a good night's sleep. Only a monstrous
creep could sleep easy at night knowing what pain he caused others.
I went downstairs and asked Juan, who was still in the kitchen to pay
me for the evening telling him that Jeffrey had gone to sleep for the night.
It wasn't an unusual request. Juan would often have to fix up "the girls"
after the sessions and sometimes even drive them home. He went to
Jeffrey's desk and underneath was his duffel bag that always held
insurmountable bundles of crisp hundred dollar bills. He took out two for
me and handed them over. I thanked him and said goodnight, as I was
always polite to Juan and his wife, Maria. His eyes were gentle and told
nector that anale was alled at see do all all
moral expense.
Putting the keys into the ignition I started up the engine and reversed out
of Jeffrey's driveway with promptness. I didn't want to be there a
moment longer than I had to. Not much to look forward too getting back
to my apartment either, I needed some time to filter my emotions.
Parking my truck in front of a nearby beach I took my shoes off gradually
stepping out of the door into the fog. I walked down to the edge of the
sand where the water licked at my toes. My life was slipping away from
me and wa was ly big of every quest, my he diesenter revolvern
around being everything to everyone, forgetting about being something
for myself altogether. Pretending to be someone else became an attribute
I was better than good at, probably much of why Jeffrey liked me in the
first place. This time I held back my tears back and only let the anger
fester into a deep pit in my stomach. My rage was aimed at the very
people who abandoned me to fend for myself in the first place and
accepted this life as normal for me, my parents.
When I got back to my apartment I was expecting to have to look after
T.J, but to my surprise he had come around good that night. He greeted
me at the door and asked how my evening was. "It was all fine" I easily
lied. I never let anyone inside close enough to see my vulnerabilities.
They were mine alone to battle. In my head they were too shameful to

talk about anyways. He wanted to talk about something else anyways.
Sitting me down at the dining room table he began his spiel. " I know you
don't think much of me anymore, how could you? I'm a junkie who
steals and sells drugs for a living, but I promise that's all going to change
now. Adam is dead because of me and the only way I can make it up to
him is to get away from it all. I promise things are going to get better." It
was a convincing talk, but I knew him all too well. His demon inside
yearned for him to fail but who was I to second-guess him out loud, I
could only try to give him hope. "No one is perfect T.J. At least you're
trying now and that's all that matters to me. I am so proud of you." I gave
him a sincere hug and kissed him for the first time in a long time. "I love
you," he said to me and I returned my love back. We slept in the same
bed together that night and were officially back on together.
Two days later I was gone again, beckoned to be in Santa Fe. Ghislane
only told me that I was to meet someone there, not sure of whom that
was. It wasn't my place to ask questions. As far as I knew it could be
anyone and I had no choice but to be compliant to their needs. It was the
middle of the day when I arrived at the airport. One of the ranch hands
came to pick me up in a big work truck that smelled like dirt and sweat
but I didn't mind that's what I loved about the countryside.

sight. He wrapped his arms around my waist and greeted me like an old
friend. I hugged him back rolling my eyes at the same time, already
dreading what lay in store over the next couple of days. My job was to
entertain him endlessly, whether that meant having to bestow him my
body during an erotic massage or simply take him horseback riding. For
the next couple of days he was to be my only concern, but he wasn't. I
called in checking on T.J a few times a day, not wanting to be a nag but
just hoping he hadn't had any thoughts about relapsing. He was doing
great, even applying for a couple jobs. Being reassured by him made my
time away less complicated and thankfully with the help of my ever-
ready Xanax I was able to cope with the ordeal.
The mansion was completely empty save a couple of maids who also
cooked our dinners for us, and a couple bodyguards that we hardly even
meeting the sexual desires of these strange men, the Prince being one of
them. He loved my feet and even licked in between my toes. Then there
was the lack of passion in the intimacy we shared, to him I was just
another girl and to me he was just another job. Not the right reasons to be
together but I thought in this world and to these monsters, there didn't
need to be a reason. To them it's nothing but a reenactment of their
personal fantasies. To me it was a living nightmare.
Thankfully one of Jeffrey's assistants from New York called me on my
cell phone early in the morning on the second day to fill me in on my
next adventure. I had a flight booked for me to leave that afternoon to
arrive at La Guardia airport in the evening. Even though I had to go back
to yet another controlling man, I was still relieved. At least I was used to
the confinements of Jeffrey's control and in some twisted way he was
more comforting than these strangers he sent me to. Overlooking the city
of New York as the plane landed felt like I was flying from one cage to
another. Entrapped by falling victim to the predators that lured me into
their enclosure. I didn't know how I would ever get out again. That deep
pit in my stomach began to churn again, a physical reaction to the anxiety
I was plagued with. Before getting off the plane I touched up my make-
up to hide any signs of the frailty I was feeling.
Jo-Jo met me at the arrival terminal and picked up my luggage for me.
He never said much at all, nodding to any reciprocating conversation. I
don't think he could really speak that good of English anyways. It was

to Jeffrey's mansion on 72"d, the place looked empty. I walked up the
staircase to Jeffrey's office and he wasn't there. Feeling a bit hungry I
walked back down to where the kitchen was. I opened the fridge and
found some leftovers that Adam, Jeffrey's chef, had cooked. I loved his
cooking, when it wasn't filled with beansprouts and tofu. He used to
make me the best pizza upon request, or whenever he was cooking
seafood, which he knew I hated. He had an honest appeal about him and
never even took notice when on many occasions us girls would be
prancing around topless, sometimes even stark naked around the pool or
beach. He would have to serve us our meals and would do it with such a
casual professionalism, never making anyone uneasy at any occasion.
Half way through iny meal the kitchen doors swung open and incoming

from my seat and kissed them both on the cheeks. " Hi guys; how are

I got out the shiny red kettle from the cupboard, knowing my way all
too well around the kitchen and put it over the hot stove plate. Turning
around to face them, I thought they were acting peculiar. "So..."Ghislane
started the conversation, "How was the ranch with the Prince?" It was a
natural reaction for me to blush, knowing exactly what she was referring
too. Keeping busy preparing her cup of tea and avoiding eye contact with
both of them I started to unpack the counter where I had been eating, "I
think he had a really good time, he seemed relaxed during the trip and
when we said good-bye to each other he gave me a kiss. " I went on to tell
them what we did together "I took him horseback riding, nowhere to far
just around the property, um... we went swimming in the pool, and of
course I gave him plenty of massages. He had a massage at least couple
times each day really seeming to enjoy his time there." It's what they
wanted to hear, not the truth of how disgusting I had felt over the whole
thing but they already knew the truth anyways, it's what they had trained
Like two proud parents they both looked over me with such content.
"Good, you did really well" Jeffrey complimented me. Turning around to
the boiling kettle, I finished Ghislane's tea for her and the conversation
led on to other subjects. We all ventured up to Jeffrey's office and out
came the infamous duffle bag that went wherever he did. I was given
close to a thousand dollars for my time in Santa Fe, more than what I
thought anybody at my young age could make for a couple days of work.
It was fulfilling the obscene vulgar needs of the so-called privileged that
earned me so much.
Chapter 18
I spent the next few days in New York, venturing out to do some
shopping therapy. I loved the eccentric parts of the city. Every street was
different but the same energetic vibe filled all of them, animated with all
different walks of life. Hanging out at coffee shops reading the newspaper
or a good book was a favorite pastime while in the big apple. Being close
enough to get back to Jeffrey for when he needed me but also far enough
to get away from all of it. Most of the day slipped by without being
missed and I made my way back to Jeffrey's.
Making one last pit stop, I walked into an old bookshop to browse at
their assortment of old titles. I wasn't in any hurry so I took my time
reading the backs of interesting looking books. I bumped into a girl
looking down the same aisle I was down. "Sorry, I'm so clumsy" she was
apologizing for my mistake. "No, no, it was my fault, I wasn't looking at
where I was going. I get so wrapped up with my nose in a book and trip
over my own two feet if I'm not careful enough." We were both giggling
now and I further introduced myself to her. Her name was Valerie or
Vickie or something like that, anyways she was a student at a school for
hairdressing nearby. Chatting away both young and similar interests in
each other's choice of reading we found it easy to speak with one another.
She wasn't from around here only being in the city for the last two
months, her parents hated her being here, but were also supportive in her
big decision to move from the countryside in hopes of her accomplishing
her own dreams. Aside from not having her near them, they just wanted
her to be happy and supported in her big decision to move to the city,
helping her pay some of the way.
She was a pretty girl with cherry red hair and soft white skin. Her long
legs were emphasized by the short flowery dress that complimented her
hourglass figure. She would definitely fit the pro quo for going down in

one of those many weekends away in the Caribbean. I was blown away
by the amount of attention Al doted on his wife, it was so sweet to watch.
They sat next to each other at the dinner table gazing into one another's
eyes having an intimate conversation between them. Among the many
guests visiting that night and many of them young beautiful women, not

the remaining pieces left from the era of the pirate's day. Upon

he was even impressed not only in our amazing finds but what we did

Jeffrey wanted his evening massage before bed and Ghislane and
Emmy went to their office to talk about something, leaving our guest of
honor to find company elsewhere. Strolling into the darkness with two
beautiful girls around either arm, Bill seemed content to retire for the
evening. He wanted to have a hot bath before bed while I began the
massage in the tub. Starting with his feet and calves, he wanted to end the
night quickly. Never showing any restraint he sat up on the edge of the
tub and asked me to preform on him orally. I did my job, but that's all our
relationship was these days, a dreadful job. Getting it over and done with
as quick as possible was my hope but I couldn't let him pick up on those

exactly how he wanted it. Only then would my duties be fulfilled and I
would be able to get back the reality of my complicated life. Before I
could say goodnight, Jeffrey had one more request. He wanted me to tuck
him under the blankets and fluff his pillows for him. Then I had to reach
under the covers and massage his feet while watching him fall asleep, he
even wanted me to wait like twenty minutes or so after he fell asleep
before I could leave. It wasn't unusual for him to ask it but God I hated it,
never offering it I would always wait for him to request it. Once he was
snoring gently I wiped my hands clean of the lotion and quietly closed the
doors to his room. Making my way up the outdoor spiraling staircase, I
felt the breeze blow through my hair and looked up to the heavens. The
stars shown so bright out here in the middle of nowhere with no big city
lights to hinder their effect I could get lost in time staring into them. No
matter how far gone I really felt there was always something about a
simple caress from the wind or the reflection of the star sweeping sky in
the black glossy ocean that would always remind me of my fond love of
nature's blessings.
Back in New York, there was nothing left of nature to adorn. It was a
dwelling for those who no longer saw the use for trees without cages or
blue skies without clouds of man made fumes and gases. Unfortunately if
we weren't in the Caribbean, we were there in New York. Hardly going
back to Palm Beach, barely even seeing my family, my dog or T.J these
days at all. In my parents heads I was all grown up and educated in the
world of wealth not needing them any longer they would just wait for my
call once in a while to let them know how I was doing and that was the
extent to our restricted relationship. The road my life has led down never
has kept me close to home anyways so to me it wasn't anything
would ve been ail to be miser though, rarely lening myself think like
that. No room for pity in my heart, if I did, the floodgates could open and
I'd have enough grief in one lifetime to go around a few times that they
would've never been closed.
Jeffrey's business was running well from the looks of his attentiveness
the office he owned in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Alan
Dershowitz, his colleague in finances and personal solicitor, a bird of the
same feather, I had seen hanging around the island and Jeffrey's
Manhattan mansion, more and more these days. Alan's taste for the
young and beautiful was a bias for a blooming business relationship
between him and Jeffrey. After an explicit session of Jeffrey's vulgar
pilgrimage into my body, we were interrupted by a knock at the door by
Jeffrey's good friend, Alan. I wrapped myself up in Jeffrey's pink bed
sheets, which is the color preference he chose to sleep in because it
reminded him of the same color of his own words "Pussy",
my face from the unexpected intrusion. Jeffrey got up and wrapped a
towel around his loins and answered the door completely calm. Opening
the bedroom door and letting Alan inside they began to converse about
business immediately, right in front of me. Jeffrey started to tell Alan
what needed to be done while he jostled some notes down quickly. I
peeked my head from underneath the covers thinking they were too
wrapped up in their work to notice me get up and dressed, and Jeffrey
turned back to me and told me to just stay there this would only take a
second. Going back to Alan he turned his focus back into work and
hustled out a few more orders before letting Alan out of the door and
returning his attention to me.
"Sorry about that, work never stops and neither will the money coming
in. How else am I going to make a million dollars while I'm sleeping?"
Jeffrey chuckled as he sat back down on the bed next to me. I laughed at
his humorous and mostly true statement, then a strand of hair fell in front
of my face. Before I could get to it he put it back behind my ears and
sweetly stroked my face, for a moment we just looked into each other's
eyes and he nearly seemed almost human to me. It was bizarre how he
could be so kind and gentle one moment and the second beforehand I was
being treated like no more than a common plaything left out for display.
Nothing more than an ego trip, Jeffrey got off on letting the ones he
wanted to know that he could own anything and anyone he wanted in this
world. Maybe for a brief minute I believed the sincerity behind his eyes
but that vision would quickly fade away and I would be left second-
guessing why I even fell for his deceitful tricks for a moment.
Jeffrey got up from the bed and asked me to join him for a shower. In
his bedroom, which was the entire top floor, he had a glass shower
enclosed underneath a glass skylight right in the middle of the room. It

course his genitals area. The sunlight shown through the glass ceilings
into where we were standing, making the moment feel even more surreal
on top of the already popped Xanax I had popped before for breakfast
earlier that morning. Jeffrey was in such a lighthearted mood that day,
making funny cracks at me, and acting like a flirt. When I was finished
washing him he actually wanted to wash me too, which was another
totally out of his character suggestion.
For the rest of the day, he took me everywhere with him, the office and
then to a friends place, even just wanting to hang out with me for a while.
I wasn't used to being treated like anything more than a dog on a leash,
when he acted like this it just completely spun me around confusing me
We were spending heaps of time together these days, a lot more than
usual. At the ranch we would do things together, alone, and not just the
usual perverted things I was accustomed to doing with him alone.
Horseback riding on his ranch during weekends away by ourselves and
movie nights snuggling up over a bucket of popcorn instead of having to
massage his feet during the entire film became his way to alter my
perception of my original notion that I wasn't just his sex slave, I thought
I was finally becoming his friend.

years. Still a hard image to change after all I had been through and seen

impression I was intrigued in our new kind of affair.

but enjoy his eagerness to see me more relaxed these days. He wasn't
even bothering me to find alternate sources of girls for his twisted
satisfaction anymore and although I was still being used for his distorted
sexual enjoyments he further seduced me into believing I meant a lot
more to him than I ever did.
It all came to a sudden conclusion one sunny afternoon in the Caribbean.
Jeffrey pulled himself up to the ladders first step and climbed up the next
four steps to the top of the dock. His chest was heaving rapidly as he sat
down catching his breath. Ghislane was the next one up and then I
followed lastly behind them. To me it was an invigorating snorkel around
the shallow reefs within the radius of the dock, but to Jeffrey the half an
hour swim in the ocean was enough to overexert his ageing limbs. I took
off my snorkel gear and placed it in the storage bench, grabbing us a few
towels at the same time. Wrapping a towel around Jeffrey's backside and
handing one to Ghislane, I sat down next to them on the dock and we
laughed how fatigued Jeffrey was, poking fun that he really is getting
older. A very touchy subject for the vain at heart but he didn't seem to
mind it, probably knowing we'd never take the joke too far. We sat there
in silence for a moment, an odd silence at that. Jeffrey looked at Ghislane
and then Ghislane looked at me, placing me once again in the spotlight.
They both scooted closer to where I was sitting and I felt something
stirring in the air. The biggest turning point of events in all of my time
spent with them.
Jeffrey sat next to me and put his hand on my back and looked at me
kind of devotion and loyalty that I believe is rare to find among people

And iust like that he created a whole new dilemma for me to face. In
utter shock from the completely unexpected proposition and before I
could even think of anything to respond with, Ghislane made the
finishing touches with the business end of the deal starting with the pros
before the cons "You would have around the clock nannies to help you.
Jeffrey would pay for a mansion of your choice in either Palm Beach or
New York" and as if the drumrolls were beckoning " and... you would

monogamous and that the child would belong in Jeffrey's custody in the
event of a falling out between the two of you." She kind of threw that last
one in there quickly, as if she could get away with me not hearing that I
would basically have to relinquish the rights to my own flesh in blood
and surrender them to a life of servitude and abuse with these people. My
maternal alarm bells went off straight away and I already knew my
answer. No way I could I do that to any poor baby, God only knew what
these monsters had in store for me let alone a baby, but it was an instant
reaction that saved me. "I don't know guy's, I mean I'm really young
and never really even thought about having kids yet. Wow, I just don't
know." I slicked my hand through my hair nervously and took in a silent
breath. I had to go beyond what I was truly feeling and give them the
feeling that I'd never let them down. Putting an eager smile on my face
and sucking up my gut's intuition I told them "You know what, let me get
my certificates in massage and have some time to prepare for this and get
healthy then next year we'll all think about having a baby together." It
was crazy to even hear me say out loud but from the expressions on their
faces I had fulfilled their wishes.

Chiane: Siting on ay ael istening (o TV-s chamil blare in the
background of my room I was painting my toenails when I was suddenly
buzzed on the intercom. It was Jeffrey calling himself to ask me to meet
him in his office in ten minutes. Perfect timing to let my nails dry I
thought to myself. Already contemplating his desire to come downstairs I
knew i had something to do with my bride resenty. wisely no
what he had in store for me.
I knocked on the slightly ajar door to Jeffrey's office and heard him
beckon me inside. "Hello, what cha up too?" I asked in a cutesy tone of
voice. Walking over to his desk he looked up at me taking his reading
glasses off while granting me a big smile. "Come over here and sit down
with me" as he ushered me to come sit on his lap. Pulling me onto him he
had a funny look on his face, like he had something really big to tell me
and was letting the anticipation build in the thickness of the silence.
"What???" I laughed at the way he was looking at me now. "First of
all... Happy birthday today." Was only the beginning of his
announcement and he proceeded to tell me "I know how much you have
wanted this for so long and you are more than deserving of it. You are
going away to Thailand to learn authentic Thai Massage and within eight
weeks you'll receive a certificate for being a qualified Thai Massage
Therapist." Astonished at his attempts to see me get what I wanted, not
exactly the type of massage I was interested in but it was a start and a
first certificate for me to acquire. My eyes lit up and I threw my arns
around his neck, planting a big kiss on his lips, which 1 rarely ever did.
"Wow, I don't know what to say, this is beyond my wildest
dreams... thank you so much!" I did well to let him know I appreciated
his grandeur offer. He went on to give me the details of where I'd be
staying, the school's schedules, and how much he loved Thai massage,
apparently it was the next big thing to hit the shores of America. He had
planned out an entire itinerary for me. I was to depart at the end of
August and he had already enrolled me in a class at "ITM Massage
School". I would only have a few days to settle in before I would be
attending classes five days a week over eight hours a day. He even had an
assignment for me to do while I was over there. I was to meet up with a
girl who was also being put up at the "Princess Hotel" where I was
staying. She had an Asian sounding name so I just assumed she was a
local girl hoping for an opportunity of a lifetime, if she only knew what
she would be getting herself into. If I decided that she met Jeffrey's
particular quota of approval then she would be sent over to the U.S to
meet with him or one of his esteemed colleagues. Besides the guilt of
having to decide a stranger's uncertain fate, everything else sounded
more than wonderful. Eight weeks gone from Jeffrey sounded like a
lifetime away and I couldn't be more excited at this chance. It was the
opportunity of my lifetime and I wasn't going to waste a second of it.
Ghislane came in a few minutes later and the look on her face told me
she already knew. I got up from Jeffrey's lap and gave her a big hug and
told her, "This is so nice of you guys, Thank you so much!" She didn't
share my enthusiasm of excitement. In a dull tone she responded, "I
didn't have a thing to do with it, it was all Jeffrey's idea but good-luck
way of telling you she cares without really ever showing it. Probably

doesn't make sense to most sane people but after all of the time spent
with them, I had gotten to understand a few of their quirky ways. Even if
I didn't agree with them, they knew I would for their sake of opinion.
What did it matter anyways I thought, I had been degraded in every other

I was sent home for a little over a week to pack for the long trip and
make the rounds visiting my family before I left overseas on my first trip
all by myself. It was great to see my family after such a long time away.
My older brother and his wife even came down to visit for the well
wishing of my departure. Everyone in my family seemed stoked at the
prospects my long journey had led me down. Here I was jet setting
around the world in my teens and getting paid to study the course of my
dreams at a cost that I only knew I would have to pay. It was a wonderful
get together with all of them around, a great way to remember them. If l'd

much I would miss them in the decade to come! But I didn't know what

I also had a few good friends to catch up with before I went. Every
night was another party and by the end of the week I had drunken enough
to drown an Irishman on St. Patty's Day. I was given the lists to all of my
friends email address and told to keep in touch. Yeah right I thought, I
was going to be too busy having too much fun to be thinking about sitting
on a computer emailing people, but I told them I would anyways. Save
myself the point of having to explain that in many different ways to a
group of already tipsy slurring teenagers. Out of everyone who was really
happy for me, T.J wasn't. He hated the idea of me leaving him to have a
non-stop party in Thailand without him. He was just starting to seem like

all. I vaid too much money on insurance for that thing and knowing his
driving record I didn't want the risk of something happening while I was
time so I just put my dog on the lead and took her for a walk to calm
down the situation and give me some time to be alone. Mary Jane was the
only one I hated leaving behind. When we got back from the long walk
she barricaded my suitcase while I was packing the horrendous amount of
clothing that I always did. I was promising her I wouldn't be long and
told her how much I loved her giving her a big hug. I choked back on the
tears that were swelling up in my eyes, it was like she already knew the
night before I flew out to New York that this would be my final trip.
There was a commercial flight booked for me in the morning and I
needed the rest that night to fully recover from my binge of celebration
drinking. T.J crept into bed later that night and tried to redeem his
behavior with sweet nothings and dry humping my backside. It did
nothing for me sexually. I didn't feel like that for him any longer and the
sooner he realized that, the better he'd be off. I told him I wasn't up for it
and he picked up a pillow and slammed the door behind him. It didn't

It was only a short flight to New York and I just couldn't wait until next
week when i'd be jetting of to an exotic destination all by my lonesome
self. It was all I could think about talk about and dream about, finally my
break. Ghislane did what she did best that week and prepped me for
everything I could imagine under the sun. Do's and Don'ts, emergency
numbers and western union locations were among some things on the list
she gave me. Like I said, she showed her caring side in other ways.
There was also the name of the girl I was supposed to be meeting, the
room she was in and what dates she would be staying there.

staircase I prepared myself for some major sucking up before I left, he
would be expecting it for his recent generosity, or so I had thought.
Opening those familiar heavy doors the first thing I saw was an
unfamiliar face standing over Jeffrey's shoulder.
She was a tall girl with blonde hair twisted up in a professional looking
knot. Her big smile was flashing at him with hints of her cheekiness to
come and she was dressed to kill with a short tight grey skirt and a
matching suit jacket over her white buttoned down blouse, revealing her
voluptuous ample cleavage. She looked like the old college professor's
wet dream. When she introduced herself to me, a thick Czech accent
presented itself. Her name was Nadia Marcinkova and Jeffrey looked just
about as smitten as a victim of a love struck arrow from no one but the
cupids themselves. Jeffrey further introduced her as his new assistant and
masseuse while I would be away, barely taking his eyes off her for one
second. It was a bit of a blow to take, being so easily replaced but also a
part of me already knew this was expected off someone like him. Good
for him I thought to myself, why should I have bitterness over someone I
never had intimate feelings for and knew had never really cared for me in
the first place. Kissing her on the cheeks and telling her my name, I was
doing my best to grin and bear it. We hugged for a brief show of
uniformity but it was just that, a show for Jeffrey to see. When he was
away for the moment or she wasn't busy hanging off his every word, the
way we all started out, she would snub me off to only head off in another
direction. A real bitch if anyone was to ask me but no one would anyways
it wasn't my job to like her.

Nadia despised me even more when Jeffrey told her to follow my lead
during the massage as she tried to take over and do her own thing a few
times. To me it was quite funny her competitive side, I had nothing more
in my eyes. After a few sessions together it was my time to be off on
another adventure far, far away from here or from the chains that I wore
servitude, but unfortunately it is the way our civilization has been for
many centuries before us and I don't see changing any time soon or as
long as perverts like Jeffrey are allowed to walk around freely and
procure our daughters off the streets all because he's got a lot of money to
pay many, many, many people off.
Throw out your confetti because here I come Chang-Mai!! My
celebrations started the second I landed, it didn't take me long to make
myself aquatinted with a few fellow travelers and find the hot spots of the
hustling city. It was like nowhere I had ever been before. The streets were
lined with stalls offering an assortment of souvenirs, clothing, and knick-
knacks. Everyone lived so freely and was in such great spirits. The parties
raged on until the wee hours of the morning and people became best
friends over night. From the second I got there I knew Thailand was
going to be a lot of fun and I was right! Popping bottles of champagne,
dancing all night to the beat of every club's rhythm's along my way and
carrying on like it was my birthday...every night was a repetition I could
definitely get used too. During the day I was a real good girl, the teachers
pet even. Showing the credibility of my experience in massage from over
the last few years and already ahead of the class the teacher was using me
to help instruct the others with demonstrations. Mostly in a class full of
males it wasn't a surprise that 1 made friends with quite a few of them,
some of them with ulterior motives, but for the most part the sleazebags
were none of my concern, I had already dealt with a lifetime of them to
be able to spot one out and steer clear of his approaches. Out of the entire
plas loadma die friend with only appy does indon saw
accent. Her first time leaving the States or Wisconsin itself for that matter
so it was easy to acknowledge that she was a little taken aback by ail of
the bustling city life so becoming her friend felt like I was doing a good
deed showing her around the hot spots of the Chaing-Mai nightlife.
Eventually I even ended up inviting her to stay with me at my hotel. She
was running out of money to party every night then pay for school on top
of her accommodation, it was all becoming too much out of her small
budget. So I thought about it and offered her a bed in my room, I had two
of them anyways. Plus she was a really nice girl and if I could help make
her first time out of the country an unforgettable experience then I was
also gaining something from it as well.
The first month in quickly passed me by. Having such an incredible
time on my own and putting my heart into learning Thai Massage it
seemed to just fly past. Routinely I had to call in and check in with
Jeffrey and Ghislane letting them know my whereabouts and progression

His eagerness put a twisted familiar knot in my stomach. Reminding me
of the dream I have to awake from soon and the reality of the certain
homecoming I would be arriving to. " It's such a great course, thank you

so much for sending me here to learn this. You are going to love my new
area of expertise! I am having such an amazing time over here!!" I had to
let him know how much I appreciated what he had done for me and he
loved the head swell that it would make him feel as well. Hating the
thought of going back to him, I wasn't going to let that put a damper on
my spirits while I was still out there. It was my time to party harder than
ever before. Every night was a new adventure for me. Chang-Mai was a
maze of places to get lost in and the vibrant city was my playground. The
way I saw it this was my last chance to get out and break free, letting
loose my inner girl it felt so good to take the lead of my own life.
Chapter 21
It was an average evening getting ready in front of the bathroom mirror
on just an average Sunday, though unbeknownst to us girls as we sat
there chatting away carelessly, this night was already written in the stars
for me. It was a very long time ago now when I was still a young child
my hands preined in th to saler aried for God to heaving pra veis.
All I asked him for was death. My precious life was already such a
hopeless battle that I felt too small to fight alone for. Begging him to
deliver me from this cruel world I would pray for all of my pain would to
away for good. My only clause in my prayers was the possibility that
there was somebody in this wide world that I was meant to love,
something much bigger than I could have even imagined vet. This
invocation of mine was forgotten about long ago now, until tonight.
wouish be diferent che night ahary had sach thysels hort to the
accustomed lifestyle I was brought up to believing was acceptable. It was
this night my very soul was about to cosmically collide with the man I
was always meant for, the man my heart already belonged to and would
know from the instant we met. This night would be the first day to the
beginning of my new life to come.
Bilitend headed ocks aid petown. We were bese no kil and toking
for something to do when we ran into a few of our class mates at one of
our favorite drinking spots. They were meeting up for some drinks before
a Muay-Thai kickboxing tournament. It sounded like fun when they
invited us alone to watch it with them. The massive crowd lined the street
where the fight was being held and once I got inside the arena it was push
and shove to try to find a spot to watch from. The friends that we were
hanging out with were meeting up with another group of guys that were
training for the kickboxing tournaments that we were watching.
Then it happened it was the first moment 1 laid eyes on the man that
would love me for the rest of my life. I wasn't expecting the most
amazing time of my life to happen right there and then but it did and I
would never be the same again. Destiny fell right smack into my lap and
there was no stopping it! It wasn't just his smoldering appeal that was
obvious at first sight it was the entire package of mannerism and chivalry
that made him stand out of the crowd. Stepping right out of the pages of
the fairytales I used to read, he was nothing like I had ever come to know
Watching him from a close distance he was playfully shadow boxing
one of the guys from my massage class and it was at that moment that
this handsome stranger first caught me staring at him. From top to toe this
athletically built man was intriguing to watch, I couldn't take my eyes off
him like I was magnetically drawn to his power of attraction. He further
interested me when he wasn't acting like the majority of harping dogs
that would jump at the eyes 1 was giving him now. Instead he coyly

After the fight and all of the men revved up from the fight, I suggested
that we all head to the pizza joint in front of the Princess Hotel where I
was staying for a late night snack. I made it my goal to make myself
known to this appealing stranger. In the tuk-tuk on the way there I made
sure I sat next to Robbie. Scooting my knees closer and closer to him on
the short ride he continued his chase by moving further away from me, a
game of cat and mouse that I loved. When he answered back the array of
my questions he had the cutest Aussie accent ta re mack the aray
Gradually we got to know each other better over a pie of peperoni
pizza and two can's of coke. Too me he might as well have been the only
other person in the restaurant, he knew he had my undivided attention and
I think he liked it. There was no one like him that I had ever met before
and I knew there was no other who could make me feel the way that I felt
at the first sight of him. Being charming and suave was all an accidental
front. It was easy to read him. Immediately it wasn't hard to see his sweet
side, holding the door and pulling out my chair at the restaurant, I was

already smitten. After pizza he walked me across the street to my hotel
where we made plans to meet up again. There was no kiss goodnight or
anything like that. No, he was too polite for that, he wanted to prove
himself different and different he was. Walking through the hotel's
revolving doors I watched as he walked away and when he was finally
out of sight, I sung my way up to my room. Floating on cloud nine I was
free falling into a deep pit of love.
The next day I attended my class as usual but not able to concentrate
like I normally did, too excited about when I'd be seeing Robbie that
night again. As I walked out of class that afternoon even the teacher
noticed a difference in my performance and asked me if I was feeling
well, "On top of the world actually" I smiled back at the old instructor
and it wasn't far from the exact truth either. I hadn't ever felt the
churning of butterflies in my stomach and the constant thoughts of
anyone else like this before. My girlfriend and I got a tuk-tuk back
together as we usually did after school and I couldn't shut up about the
night before. She was laughing at my girlishness telling me that anyone
who just met me would think i had never been let out before, but little did
she know that I had more than my fair share in experience with men and
never had I ever come across anyone that could make me feel this way,
and what spun me out even more was that it was such an instant
attraction. Never considering myself a person who believed in the
existence of "Love at first sight", but a true romantic deep at heart, T
couldn't help but believe in it now. He is my walking proof of it!
Waiting for me in the hotel lobby was the very person I couldn't stop
entertaining the thought of all day long, there he was looking ever so fine
standing in front of me now. The whole entire world faded away and all
that was left for the moment was this complete stranger 1 had only met
There sha but need for mape vy the ero some le aread heat was
snagged hook, line and sinker. Smiling all the way up the many stories in
the elevator up to my room he took notice of the posh décor of the hotel.
"You should see where I'm staying, this is a royal palace compared to it"
His first impression of me he automatically thought I was going to be a
spoiled high-maintenance girl that had money coming in from a parents
stranger almost everything.
Lie that knew was wrong and being the first time had shoken bout my
years with Jeffrey to anyone honestly like that ever before, I had felt like
i had deserved punishment. He offered me no judgment, instead only
gave me his warmth and compassion as he wrapped his strong arms
around me, making me feel so meager and small but so safe at the same
time. Encouraging me to see the worthiness of myself and leave that life
behind, he adorned me with a kind love that I wasn't accustomed too.
He took me in and made me feel so at home. It was like I had known
him my whole life. I couldn't bear to be without him another second
while I was away on this dream holiday. When he wasn't training for
Muay-Thai tournaments and I wasn't in school, nobody would ever see
us. Too enveloped in each other in my hotel room to care about anything
else. Which is why I asked him to come stay at my hotel with me, seeing
he was never at his own anyways. My girlfriend was soon departing back
to Wisconsin, making my room more than available for him. Enchanted
by his words and tender touch, the way he made love to me was again
like nothing I had experienced before. Even down to after sex as I had
been routinely instructed by Jeffrey to get up for a warm washcloth to
clean his genitals afterwards, he refused it, telling me I was no longer a
slave and that he didn't want me acting like one. He'd just rather lay
down together afterwards and repeat our sweet nothings with many
adjoining kisses.
On our third night together with nothing but the bed sheets between us,
we had spent all night looking into each other's eyes sharing such an
undeniable passion for one another. In the deepest caverns of my heart I
knew this man would give me what I had never experienced
before... True love. We were still laying in each others arms when the
orange and pink sunrise began to rise slowly through the peak's of my
rooms windows, enticing me to come feel the freshness of the morning's
chill. Only the bed sheets were still wrapped around my body as I went
the balcony. It was overlooking the city in a valley surrounded by
mountainous tops. My thoughts began to rampage through my head and I
knew this could only be a dream for me. It was getting serious now, too
serious for the life that I led back home. As if he sensed my anxiety
Robbie walked up behind me and wrapped his strong arms around my
my thoughts. "Back home, as you already know, I am going back to
someone else, it's my job, and as much as I really like you, this guy that I
kind of see is going to expect me to be putting him first, I am so sorry to
say all of this after such a wonderful few days we have spent together, but
you need to know this thing happening between us can't get anymore
serious than what we have for now. I am so sorry" I looked down to the
floor with nothing else I could say to alter his perception of me now that I
had told him the truth and it never dawned on me that thought he
wouldn't be out the door before I could even finish my sentence but he

continued to surprise me with his efforts to make me believe we were
more than just friends with a summer crush. " You see... your problem is
that you don't see what I am looking at right here in front of me, a
beautiful girl who is completely lost in a game that she has no control
over. Get out of it now, take my hand and follow me back to my home in
Australia." I heard what he had said but I found it hard to comprehend
what he was actually talking about. "What?" I asked him with a look of
mont His tat my fat Yor abody re property as can do this. Marry
Repeating the question he got on one knee and proposed again " Jenna, I
am in love with you and want to spend the rest of my life making you
happy. Please don't go back to him. I know that I am the only one for you
and I will always treat you right. He paused for another second and
repeated his question "Jenna, will you please marry me?" My hands fell
into my face after that and without even letting myself think through the
answer, I let my heart do all of the talking. Looking back up at him I said
"Yes!" I almost shouted the answer at him, as if saying it louder would
give the word more meaning. Wanting to believe him and everything that
he was saying felt like a vacation from all of the suffering and loneliness
that yod wad ad era feare or direrend dings that rately owing
hand in hand...or so I thought. All I knew from the brief period I had
known this stranger was that he was offering me a life and love down an
unfamiliar path and it was a gamble to believe a complete stranger but
somehow I knew he was right. My heart was beating so loud I thought it
was going to jump right out of my chest. With the earnestly in my reply
he picked me up in his strong arms and took me back to the bed and
reiterated his words in a more physical sense this time. Never had I felt
loved like this before, so swept off my feet and unable to even think, eat,
or do anything for that matter which would involve leaving the hotel
Everyday after school would be my Robbie waiting to take me back to
the hotel room for another night's passionate rendezvous, but a few
nights after his proposal, he had another surprise in store. He didn't just
want to get married someday. He wanted to get married now, this week
even. I walked into the fabric store and was attended too by several
seamstresses who were already be expecting my arrival. I was there to
design and have fun designing my own dream wedding dress. While I
was busy picking out fabrics and having measurements taken I would
look away for a moment only to catch his tender eyes staring in my
direction. Such adoration behind his looks... could it be real? I would
often ponder it to myself just hoping for the gamble I was taking to work
out. I still had to believe in something better than what I was accustomed
too and here he was right smack dab in front of me.
Giggling at all of the lace and frills they were trying to dress me up in,
looking more like an antique porcelain doll than anything else I closed
my eyes and pictured the day that I thought would never come, starting to
imagine the kind of dress I would like to wear I envisioned a simple
sleekness, a complimentary figure hugging gown with a small train but
long enough to distinct it as an actual wedding dress. After we settled on
what we were going to wear for the big day, we would next have to
decide where we would hold the ceremony. Not before celebrating the
entire week beforehand though. We started our honeymoon early
celebrating every night spending our time between my hotel room and
sending our heads spinning on the dance floor at many different clubs.
Only with each other in sight, the dance floor was ours, we were out to
give each other something to remember each night by. I whispered all of
the things I couldn't wait to do him once we got back to the hotel room
and watching him heat up on the dance floor I was never able to get
enough of him driving me crazy. Like a thirst I was unable to quench, his
lips were like a fountain of deep springs that I could never reach the
Seven days, exactly a week after his proposal I sat on my bed in distress,
contemplating what I would say to the man who I was about to call.
There was no nice way to go about it. I couldn't last forever with him and
this was my one chance to get out of it for good. I was leaving him, never
to return to him ever again. I just had to go ahead and do it. Part of me
was hoping he'd be at least a little happy for me and the sudden change in
my life's direction but the other part of me knew I was already asking too
Calling his office in New York I was transferred to Jeffrey's personal
office. He picked up the phone on the third ring, pausing before I could
get any of the words to come out of my mouth but I mustered up my
courage eventually and gave him my prepared spiel. Beginning with how
much I had appreciated everything he has done for me up until this point.
I hoped he would be understanding but he just wanted me to hurry up and
get to the point. Trying to contagiously pass on my excitement through
the phone lines, I finally screamed out "I'm getting married! Can you
believe it?" No reply was given only a silence on the other end. Trying to
make some conversation ridding the uncomfortable silence, I went on to
tell him about Robbie and how I had fallen madly in love with him over
the last amazing few days we'd spent together. The absence of sound
made my thoughts begin to run wild and to get some response I had to
ask him what he thought about everything I was telling him. Finally a few
seconds later his reaction to the news sunk in and his only and final reply

until many years to come was " Have a good life!" With that statement he
slammed down phone receiver. Leaving only an echo of the dial tone to
answer back too. I was to paralyzed from the shocking response. "What
have I just done?" was the first thing that entered my thoughts.
Overwhelmed with guilt I felt like I was falling down a deep and dark
hole and then the tears began to flood in. Here I was standing at the dawn
of a new happy life for myself and I couldn't see past how bad I had let
Jeffrey down not yet seeing the hold he had on me.
Like my knight on a white horse, in came my hero to soothe my
somberness. He rushed over to the bed where I was beating myself up
mentally and wiped the falling tears from my cheeks. "I take it that it
didn't go so well...huh?" Sniffling through my sobs I managed to tell
him that "It doesn't matter anymore all I care about is you and leaving all
of that life behind me!" I wrapped my arms around him and he asked me
in a half joking voice "Then why are you crying?" He got me almost
laughing now too "I guess it's just so scary taking such a huge plunge
away from what I'm used too and taking such a big move to another
country. It's just all so different and I'm just trying to comprehend
everything that is happening in such a short time." Always out to lift my
spirits his next comments made me gush in laughter "You think that was
a hard phone call wait until I call my Sicilian mother! Watch this, I know
exactly what she'll say. First it'll be a saga about how I'm killing her with
my selfish actions then it'll be about how she's going to kill herself for
doing such a terrible job raising normal children. Don't worry though,
she'll love every second of it. Wogs thrive off of the drama in their lives
and off everybody else's for that matter!!" He was pretty much on the dot
when he told me how she'd react to the news. In the end after relentlessly
trying to change his mind, she sighed, "If it was going to be anybody to
do something as crazy as this, Robbie, it would be you!" It wasn't a

later why they hadn't put up a fight, he just simply replied that nobody
expected it too last very long. Fair enough, I thought. I don't think
anyone did at first...even us at our toughest times. We were a rare
attribute these days in the numb era we have all been accustomed to
living in, turning nothing into something, which I had also come to
realize, was the most precious gift in life...Love.
Falling asleep was easy to do in his arms that night. I laid my head on
top of his chest listening to the drum of his beating heart. I had never felt
like I was more at home than ever before in my life. He pulled me gently
in closer to him, letting me know that he was there for me even when the
lights went out and the thoughts would usually creep in. Amazing how he
knew what I needed without even asking for it. Wishing for something
like this my whole life I thought I was being such a fool in so many ways,
but I was so wrong. The way his pretty eyes looked at me with such an
understanding and compassionate sincerity made me want to trust his
words and believe the love that he was offering me was indeed real.
The next morning, Robbie was up and out of bed early to pick up our
tailored wedding suits and dresses for our big day at Doi Cept Temple.
His best friend from high school days that was travelling with him from
Australia met him in the hotel lobby at seven o'clock. He was going to be
joining us for the wedding as Robbie's best man. He still hadn't been able
to find black shoes to go with the suit, so after he dropped off my dress
back to me he was off again to try and find himself a pair of decent
looking ones. Overjoyed with excitement I was thrilled from the second I
kissed Robbie good-bye for the last time before we were officially
married. Looking in the same mirror only a week ago I was now a
different person, I felt like I was plunging into a bottomless abyss. Here I
go, I thought to myself as I plunged out the door letting the butterflies in
my stomach carry me all the way to my nearly husband.
1 had to go to the beauticians that morning for my pre- wedding makeup
and dressing. The ladies who were doing my hair and face at the salon did
a great job making me feel so beautiful for my special occasion that every
girl dreams about their whole entire life. Requesting simplicity at best,
not wanting to go overboard with all of the wedding apparel they tied my
long hair up into a knot wrapping around it a veil of flowers made up of
baby's breath and small yellow and purple budding flowers. I couldn't
have dreamt it up better myself and when I met my husband to be at the
bottom of the mountain he stood before me speechless "You look so...
beautiful!" were his first words that his mouth formed almost whispering
them. He took my hand and we walked into the sky lift together. Behind
us followed an interpreter that Robbie hired to translate the Buddhist
Monks ceremony speech for us English only speakers and then his best
friend, who only moments before gave him the best mans speech about
being the last chance to walk away from this and not get married to a girl
he hardly knew, but my Robbie wouldn't hear a word of it. He already
made up his mind the instant he proposed and I said yes, "I was born to
be with this girl," he told his best mate. "Alright then lets go do this
then!" Once he knew Robbie was sure in his decision he was more than
ecstatic for him. We were slowly lifted up the tremendous mountainside,

surrounded by the floral green carpet of mossy grass that covered the
earthly skyscraper and falling fog, it was like being carried to heaven or
the closest thing to it! Taking my eyes off the scenery and catching him
adoringly staring at me again, I welled up with unstoppable tears. "I am
so lucky, is this really happening?" He squeezed my hands and replied
back "You're the only one for me...I love you!" relieving the anxiety
written all over my tear stained face.
Chapter 22
Getting out of the carriage we were greeted by good fortune from the
Gods above. A sun shower cascaded over us at we advanced into the
ancient holy temple. My tears of joy dried and my happiness was glowing
for all to see. The many visitors to the temple stopped and took photos of
the passing bride and groom, no other foreigners had ever been married
there and certainly anyone wearing traditional western wedding attire,
such a sight had never been seen behind these religious walls, we became
a permanent icon at the temple. The ceremony was done in the Buddhist
customs according to their ancestral accordance, and translated for us in
our own language. Both Robbie and I were anointed with a blessing from
the monk with a splash of water and seven sacramental bracelets, each
one representing another meaning to the longevity of our union together.
We signed our names in the Buddhist wedding registry of Doi Cept
Temple and officially became Mr. & Mrs. Roberts at least officially in
our hearts knowing the laws of Australia only recognize certified
weddings, meaning when we got back to his homeland we'd have to
make a run for the courthouse. This was our real wedding though, perfect
down to every detail. Walking up to the highest point of the temple to the
balcony hanging over the edge of a cliff side over looking the city of
Chang-Mai, we knew we had found the perfect spot to recite our vows of
love to each other. Providing everything for me and more than I could
ever ask for, his vows were to love me unconditionally until death do we
part, shelter me from all the cruelty in the world that I was so accustomed
too and to be like the bear. because the bear never forgets. Tears once
again streamed down from my eyes as he made this moment
unforgettable. Wiping the mascara fading underneath my eyelids whilst
giggling at my embarrassment I took his hands back into mine again and
gave him the vows that were the sacred prepared words from my heart.
My ears were thundering the sound of a million horses hoofs descending
downhill and my heart was beating so fast my words barely trembled out
of my mouth when I began to tell him how much he had changed my
whole life around and how I would dedicate my entire being to loving
him and only him until I blew my final breath.
I meant every word that I said to him, this was it for me, wanting
nothing more out of life than to be with someone like him to raise a few
kids together and grow old on the front porch letting the days fade us by.
I know it probably sounds boring to most and it would've to me as well
many years ago but after the life I had led, I had enough experience in the
real world for my liking and now all I want to do is to enjoy the
remaining days of my life for what it is...a simple and satisfying
existence. Our day was so special but not only to us, even too the Monk
that married us. Upon our descent down the lifts he asked if he could take
a photo with the bride and groom in front of their symbolic liberty bell
signifying the union between east and west. It represented a lot for us too,
it was the commencement of a new life together and just the beginning of
battling each other's past demons together.
Kissing the bridal party goodbye, who were just the local girls I had
met on some of our many nights out of having fun. I threw my arranged
bouquet of Thailand's white wedding floras mixed with colorful orchids
to the screaming Thai women behind me and we were given one last
tradition to take with us, the release of caged doves. It was such an
incredible gesture, especially for me. Symbolizing their freedom as well
as mine I opened the cage's door to let them free to decide our own fates.
As the wings on the birds began to spread open and they took their final
decent into the blue skies granting themselves freedom I knew mine had
finally come too. The relevance of watching them fly away and how I had
perceived my own day of marriage related to the identical feeling of
fleeing an entrapment of my own kind. I was liberated from the bounds of
slavery I had come to know over the many years I had spent with my fair
share of greedy perverted old men only to have serendipity mend my
scars with the powerful healing of what true love has to endeavor on.

were gone they were also given instructions by none other than the groom
himself to pick the petals off the steins of red roses to place on our bed in
the shape of a giant heart. The rose petals led the way to where we
consummated our love physically and it was undeniably the first time in
my life I had really ever been made love too. Hours had passed by before
we thought about anything else besides one another's words of arousal,
tantalizing touches, and lingering kisses. We ate a quiet dinner at a local
restaurant and went straight back to the arms of each other again, so

profoundly in love with one another it was the ideal display of what the
"honeymoon period" should have to show for. It was crazy, young and
energetic, just what it should be between two blossoming lovers.
The following morning we left the Princess Hotel, no longer under any
of Jeffrey's financial privileges or control so to speak, continuing our
love spree in another dwelling of our own accord. Three days later when
we finally showed our face for the first time since checking in downstairs
in the new hotel lobby, besides to request fresh sheets and towels, the
entire staff of the hotel had a good laugh at our expenditure, from their
reaction it must've been nice to see a couple so affectionately fond of
Now we wanted to have another type of fun, Robbie had visited a
tourist agent by himself before we got hitched to book a honeymoon
itinerary for us to explore Thailand and beyond together, another surprise
he had in store for me. We left early in the morning and joined the
crowded bus for our journey beyond the border of Thailand to a village in
the war torn nation of Laos. When we got through the extremely armored
visa office eight hours off the beaten path, we then had to cross a flooding
river from a recent heavy downpour of rain in a slim banana boat that
looked like it could barely handle our weight let alone the excess of my
luggage that Robbie was so kind to trek around the world for me.
Unbelievably we did make it to the other side only to find that my
honeymoon in the tropics wasn't exactly how it had been explained to
me. Naked children ran through the dirty streets, with one boy that
decided to release his bladder on the pathway where we were walking as
we passed by him on the way to our hotel. My doubts of his choice in
destinations became apparent after that sight. Robbie was getting hungry
after we hadn't eaten the entire duration of the trip and being such a
suded me roe ud diges sume kind of school dising ringo on ghe
settling for some toast and jam, something safer I thought. Then I saw the
lady behind the counter dip some plates in a dirty bucket full of dirty
water and then rinse in another bucket of water that didn't look as bad as
the previous mud drenched one and then further proceeded to put my
toast and his food on top of them serving it to us all in a clear view. I iust
couldn't bring myself to even fathom it "I can't eat that!" I mouthed in a
hushed voice trying to quietly make my point clear but was made public
with his loud mouth outburst of "Why not? Looks fine to me. You have
to try and eat something, vou haven't eaten all day!" I know it was just
his carine side that was trying to force me and to too it off he is Sicilian
and they're all about eating so it was our first debate and now we were
officially married with many more marital conflicts to subsequently
follow. Two head strong and stubborn people both with the right
intentions but still recovering from old wounds. It was only natural and
important that we fought just as much as we made passionate love
together. Countlessly proving to one another the true intentions of each
other loves but sometimes in not so seemingly actions.
Finally arriving at the hotel it was like a scene out of a horror flick. We
were showed up to the room that looked like someone had been brutally
killed in. The bed sheets were torn apart and the bed was stained with
blood from some poor helpless victim. Nearly vomiting at the pure sight
of the room and the stench that accompanied it, I was now tearing at the
thought of even staying here for a single moment longer. "No way!" I
told my new husband and from the tone in my voice he knew I was
serious. Not that I was not denying the fact I have never been an outback
type of girl. I was fine with that impression, I am no snob but give me the
simple luxuries of a clean bed and a shower then I'll make myself at
home, but this was just the epitome of filth and even possibly an act of a
horrendous event but who knows, the lady who showed us to the room
seemed fine with it passing it off as a hooker on her period. In some ways
that was even worse... "Yuk. Okay Robbie it's time to go... now!" we
were heading back down hill back to the passport center declaring our
passage bars sing Tha border an black, he africad held that umpine
while others rummaged through our luggage for drugs or whatnot.
Finding nothing of course they released us and stamped our passports,
making us good for another three months if we wanted. We were thankful
for escaping with our lives alone, although we had nothing to hide but
still an endearing experience nonetheless in the first days of our
honeymoon of all days.

Arriving in Koh Samui for finally a bit of relaxation in the tropics, it
was my idea of how a holiday should be, sunny warm, and clean... well,
clean enough. We lived it up like kings for the next six weeks. Making it

wife and belonging to a husband like Robbie. Marriage was bliss for the
duration of our honeymoon until we had to ride coach on our way to
Bangkok Airport to fly out to Australia. Chatting away with always so
much to say to each other we watched a movie and finally got
comfortable leaning up against each other as pillows. We both fell asleep
on the long ride and when we woke up to the sound of the buses brakes
coming to a halt we initially realized my purse and Robbie's wallet with
all of our money and cards in it was missing. Stranded in the city of
Bangkok was frightening enough as it was but too make matters worse a
lady looking in her mid-seventies, scrawny and hunched over from an
obvious lack of nutrition lifted up her skirt to a passer-byer with a she-
male hanging off his arm and began smacking her vagina blaring out
"Look! No cock... Pussy, pussy! Only five baht" repeating herself many
times over the man just walked on past as she sat back down on the curb
waiting for the next alluring customer. Robbie and I shook our heads in
disgust and disbelief, things could really be that bad for someone, I would
know best as it wasn't far off the life Jeffrey had been training me up for.
Completely broke at two o'clock in the morning and with no one to call
for help, I panicked right away. Robbie rubbed my back and his tired eyes
trying to make the situation better. Luckily we had made friends with
some really nice people from the resort on the island who gave us about
two thousand baht when they saw how devastated Robbie and I were.
With just enough money to rent a really cheap room for the night at a
backpackers hostel and pay for a taxi to the airport the following day, we
Early the next morning we were off in separate planes, since Robbie's
ticket was pre-booked and no available seats left for me to join him meant
we would be landing in Australia separately. Fortunately we had found a
corresponding flight that arrived within the same hour of each other but I
would have to make a stop over to the Philippines. The lengthy hours of
the duration on the flight seemed to stretch on with only the thoughts of
the journey ahead of me I couldn't wait to get back to my husbands
loving arms. The trip was going well, sleeping the majority of the flight
until I had to change planes in the Philippines.
After the plane landed and before any passenger was allowed to get off

and I handed over the requested information. The officer looked me over
and got on the phone immediately which sounded like a phone call to his
superiors but I couldn't tell since it was in another language. A brief
conversation but long enough to get me thinking, he then called over two
guards who took me by the arms and brought me into an empty room but
for a desk and three chairs to be interrogated. No one would tell me what
was going on they all just scattered around in frenzy, ignoring all of my
hysterical inquisitions. Leaving me by myself and alone with my thoughts
I couldn't help but panic even worse now.
This was a total bombshell of confusion on my part, what had I done
wrong? Minute's later a large-framed women in a green uniform entered
the room with the guards from before and sat down across from me with
a stern look in her eyes. She placed my documents on the desk in between
us. Not saying a word to me she was waiting for me to give her an
explanation for something. "Can you please tell me what this is about,
have I done something wrong?" I asked her politely, trying to restraint
any animosity towards her. Her reply sounded as grim as she looked.
"You have been in Thailand for three months and now you have only a
one way ticket booked to Australia with no visa. What exactly are your
plans once you get there, Ms. Roberts?" To myself I wondered what

her for a moment, deciding whether or not she would grant me
permission to meet my husband in Australia or send me back alone to
Bangkok. With only time on my side she had to make a hasty verdict
now. One more question had to be answered before I was let go, she
wanted some proof. " If you have just got married can you show me your
marriage certificate then?" This didn't help my stories credibility at all
seeing that we were married in a Buddhist temple and given woven
bracelets instead of certificates. Explaining to her that I didn't have one to
show her yet but was already aware that I would have to obtain a legal
marriage certificate through a courthouse upon my arrival in Australia to
stay there legally, it was only because of my husbands beliefs we wanted
to get married in a Buddhist ceremony. She must have shared a common
interest in religion or something like that as she finally cracked a smile

my adrenaline was still pumping from the previous encounter with the
officials of the Philippines who had enough power to condemn me if they
had felt like it. I caught my plane in the knick of time and once I was
settled in my seat my thoughts went back to my dear Robbie and how
much I was missing him. I was just relieved that I was on my way to be
back with him again soon.
Looking out the window 1 could see the red earth beneath me. As I
landed for the last time I took notice of the first steps I walked off the
plane and onto a new soil for the first time. I had so much to be looking
forward too in my new homeland. In my heart I knew this was all I ever
wanted, this was going to be my haven. There was another surprise in
store for me when two elder strangers walked up to me and asked my
name. "Are you Jenna?" Nodding at their question they gave me their
first names and wrapped their arms around my neck. My new mother-in
law then said, " We are Robbie's parents. We wanted to be the first ones
who welcomed you to Australia and into our family" It was my in-laws
meeting me for the first time. Handing me some balloons and flowers
they even had gifts for their new daughter-in law. While waiting for
Robbie's plane to arrive we all chatted about many things like the flight
over from Thailand and the scare at the previous airport in the
Philippines. I asked them how they knew whom to look for? My father in
law laughed, saying recognizing me was easy from Robbie's detailed
description. He told them to look out for a petite, young blonde carrying
an abundance of luggage. Laughing together over a few more brief
conversations of getting to know each other better they seemed relieved
to finally meet me compared how stressed she sounded in the
conversations 1 overheard Robbie having with her while in Thailand.
Watching the arrivals board I knew Robbie's plane had landed ages ago
but was just waiting for him to get out of customs. It didn't bother me
anyhow. I was enjoying get accompanied with his parents for the first
time. Eventually i saw my husband walking down the runway behind the
gates, I just couldn't wait a second longer. i ducked underneath the gates
and ran all the way up the runway to jump excitedly into his arms. I

taken a lot of hard work and doesn't come without its flaws but no matter
what it is just perfect for the two of us. He helped me how to remember to
smile again and life has slowly began to sort itself out. They say that time
heals all wounds but what I had experienced in my young years wasn't
nearly long enough to let all of the hurt go. Seeking help through many
counselors and psychiatrists I was doing everything I could do to deal
with the scars and all of the pain left behind. Completely off of any
pharmaceuticals, since the last day of our honeymoon, and healing my
heart with love instead of hate our marriage is my foundation and Robbie
is my solid rock. We have to be for one another, putting the bonds of our
union through the wringers and back, as neither of us expected my past
life eventually to come back and haunt me after so long.
Our blissful life came to a sudden halt one day when we were out
visiting my in-laws at their nearby house on just another plain afternoon.
There was a knock on the front door and my father in law got up from
watching TV on the couch to answer it. He rushed back quickly coming
into the dining room, where I was feeding my nineteen months and five
month old boys at the table, and he blurted out, "Jenna there are three
police officer's at the door asking for you by the name of Virginia
Roberts!" I asked my mother in law to stay with the babies to find out
Jhatey it was al vas. diden even think it aenything dodo to otter
they were racetly police oficers and two federal agents of
Australia with one F.B.I agent from America. The American agent asked
ifI wouldn't mind actually coming outside so that I may speak with them
in private. "Okay" I said, as well as mentally preparing myself for
something big from the look of it, it's not over a parking ticket or
anything small that you get three federal agents knocking at your in-laws
front door asking to speak in private. "Can we first ask you if you are in
fact Ms. Virginia Roberts and originally from Palm Beach County in the
United States?" T confirmed my name and previous state of residence
then they even asked, "May we see some identification please?" A
different agent asked the question this time and I told him "I will have to
go and grab it, my purse is inside. I'll just be one second."
Robbie was standing on the other side of the door trying to figure out
what they were doing here talking to me and when I rushed through it to

Pulling out my Australian drivers license from my wallet, I was going
to hand it over to them but they were sufficed at a quick glance. There
was no meet and greet, they went straight to the point. One agent picked
up a briefcase off the porch floor and opened it up taking out a stapled
stack of paper. Then that same agent asked me if I had ever known an
affiliate by the name of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. All of the sudden my
stomach tangled in a familiar knot that I hadn't felt in many years from a
past life that I was trying to forget about. I nodded in affirmation of their
question and said "It was a long time ago and he's no longer an affiliate
of mine, but yes, I did know him once." It was shameful enough to think
about let alone talk about with them for the first time since I had started
my entire life over. His next response left me nothing short of speechless.
The United States Attorney's Office for the district of Florida was giving
me a notification of being an identified victim. Jeffrey was finally caught
for his atrocious acts of perversion on girls who were barely old enough
to even comprehend "the birds and the bees" so to speak.
On June 30" 2008, Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty for procurement of
minors to engage in and solicitation of prostitution. More than a dozen
girls had been named as victims of Jeffrey's federal offense's and without
ever stepping a day in court he was granted a plea bargain consenting to
charges that named him a registered pedophile for only two of the minor
girls. Getting away with even serving only twelve of the sentenced
eighteen months behind bars be that in the evening alone and in the
morning he was released during the day. Restricted to the confinement of
his lavish mansion in Palm Beach only to be with his original sex slaves
from over ten years ago, Nadia Marcinkova and Sarah Kellen, and
knowing Jeffrey all too well, they wouldn't be the only ones there while
he was pulling his laughing stint of retribution. Even at nighttime the girls
were still allowed to visit him, accounting to nearly seventy times while
serving his time in incarceration.
No justice had been served for any of us victims. Denied the very
constitutional rights allegedly there to protect and serve us. We weren't
allowed to have a voice in front of a jury and judge or even informed for
that matter. Instead we were handed this notification of being a victim but
told we were all too late to do anything about. To make matters worse
part of that plea bargain was that we had the option to sue him with the
lawyers he provided for us, and conveniently enough I found out later
they were also his lawyer's old friends from the college days.

the words to tell my husband what was going on. I rushed to the back of
the house and went out to the back yard where I wanted a minute to
compose myself and process the information I had just been told. Robbie
followed behind me but the stillness in my eyes convinced him to give
me that moment to compile my emotions.
A few moments later and I was ready to talk. Collapsing into his arms
with such anguish, he just held me until my sobs subsided and I was able
to tell him what actually happened. Starting with an apology, I began to
tell him how I was so sorry but my troubled past has come back to plague
our simply sweet lives and was just about to turn it all upside down. He
was so understanding from the beginning of all this, telling me that he
will always be behind every choice that I make in mending the sorrows of
my tormenting past and there he has been through all of the thick and
Deciding to call the lawyers on the victim suit provided for me was a
big decision but one 1 had to do to seek the unanswered questions from
my battered heart. The two women at the firm that I spoke to treated me
so wonderfully, like long term friends they counseled me not only in the
terms of a lawsuit towards Jeffrey but also in the matters of being
emotionally and sexually abused. I chose to proceed with the lawsuit at
spotlight for everyone's entertainment where he had kept me for so many
Winning my lawsuit against him was not enough to heal old wounds, I
never got the chance to stand up in front of a jury and tell them how
much pain I had endured and still endure throughout the many nightmares
I face when darkness hits and the silence of the sleeping household fills
my head with pictures of reliving my past with him or the others he sent
me too. Or did I even get to hear him confess his guilt and suffer the way
I did locked in confinement for many years? No, instead I got to see a
picture of Jeffrey with his arms around a very youthful looking teenager,
if even that, parading the streets of New York, the very way he had with
me and so many other girls long before.
As if it were a public display intended for not only his many victims to
see but also a spectacle for the public justice system, it was bold show of
insolence laughing in our faces while we all sat by not being able to do
anything to help these young girls from the streets still suffering his
perverted afflictions. Not much longer there was another story on Jeffrey
İ saw in the papers of him and Prince Andrew having a stroll together in
Central Park. It instantly sparked my concerns for other girls in the verv
same position I was in so long ago and he was obviously up to the same
old tricks, I had to do something now. Not being able to sit by any longer

with the knowledge of being able to help out in some way. I had to tell
my story no matter how shameful it was to even speak about. Putting my
shame aside I had to derive every bit of courage I could sustain and now I
am ready to tell it. The hardest lesson I had failed at learning until later
on in my life became my strength, the belief in my inner voice and the
ability to speak up. I do have a voice and now the world is going to hear
it in my whispered cries for justice. Swept away by a surge of media with
one phone call I sent Jeffrey's publicist into frenzy. Not to mention the
release of the photos showing the first night that Prince Andrew and I
shared together that I so happened to unveil for the public to see.
I spent too much of my life going out of my mind waiting for the
rescue that never came until it was too late and then the scars were
already imbedded deeply within. Thankfully I am now free from the
struggles that nearly destroyed the love inside of my heart. I only wish it
could be the same for the other victims, not just of Jeffrey's inflictions
but every person who has ever suffered at the hands of another.
I'm here to tell you from my own experience that the moon is yours if
that's what you want, all you have to do is stand up and take it. If some
girl off the streets of Florida, like me, can stand up against the tyrants that
run the deep pockets of our world, than anyone can. Just like I needed to
believe that someone stood up for me once like Robbie did long ago, I
now stand up for us. For all of us girls, the ones who are still on the
streets and think they don't deserve better or it's an unachievable dream
to be entitled to more out of life. For all of the beautiful girls who don't
see beyond they're outside appearance. For all the girls still trapped in
enslavement and unable to get out of the abuse that holds them down. But
most of all, I stand up for every girls belief in love, because it is the very
savior of my spirit and soul.

she has continued to try and promote Victims Refuse
Silence at every possible chance she gets with -- the
story she told me was that someone had come to her
door, knocked on the door, selling something or talking
about something totally different, and she explained
what our mission was and tried to get them to, then, go
and spread the word for victims of human trafficking,
as well.
And this would be in Australia this
conversation occurred?
A
Correct.
Okay. To your knowledge, is VRS incorporated
in any fashion in the country of Australia?
A
It is not.
To your knowledge, does VRS have any website
presence in Australia?
A
I believe that the internet works everywhere,
so I would say yes, because, if you Google Victims
Refuse Silence, we do have a website. So I would
imagine that that's something that would come up in
Australia.
Okay. Other than the somebody knocking at
her door, that conversation, did she report to you
anything else that she has done on behalf of Victims
Refuse Silence in the last year, let's say?

on behalf of VRS?
I do not believe her appearance there was
made on behalf of VRS, but I do believe that - I know
that she wanted to promote the charity, so that we
could start helping people and that she could start
getting her mission out to the public.

We'll look at it. And that would be the only

Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page6 of 37
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Before the Court reaches the question whether plaintiff can prove falsity and actual
malice, it should decide three questions of law, one that narrows considerably the legal issues
and two that dispose of the case entirely.
1. It is undisputed Ms. Maxwell, through her agents, sent to various media-
representatives and to no one else—the January 2015 statement. It is undisputed she had no
control over any of the media that decided to republish excerpts from the statement. On these
facts, under black letter New York law, she is not responsible for these republications. Plaintiff's
contrary argument relies on a "foreseeability" doctrine the New York Court of Appeals has
specifically rejected. Summary judgment should enter in favor of Ms. Maxwell as to any
republication.
2. Under the New York Constitution, whether a statement is constitutionally
nonactionable opinion depends upon, among other things, an examination of the full context of
the communication and consideration of the setting surrounding it. The January 2015 statement,
making no reference to specific allegations, explains why the author believes plaintiff's
allegations are "obvious lies": "Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious
details..." It is an expression of a venerable opinion: when a person falsely cries wolf
previously, others are free to opine she is telling falsehoods now. This is nonactionable opinion.
3. Under New York law, a statement made pertinent to good faith anticipated litigation is
nonactionable. The statement was sent exclusively to the media representatives, and contained a
clear message: the media should not republish plaintiff's "obvious lies," else Ms. Maxwell would
sue them. Such a statement is nonactionable.
If the Court reaches the question of falsity and actual malice, the Rule 56 record
establishes plaintiff cannot prove falsity and actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.

Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page7 of 37
ARGUMENT
I. Ms. Maxwell is not liable for republications of the January 2015 statement.
Under black letter New York law, liability for republication of an allegedly defamatory
statement "must be based on real authority to influence the final product." Davis v. Costa-
Gavras, 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1096 (S.D.N.Y. 1984). "[W]here a defendant 'had no actual part in
composing or publishing,' he cannot be held liable." Id. (citing Folwell v. Miller, 145 F. 495, 497
(2d Cir. 1906)); accord Geraci v. Probst, 938 N.E.2d 917, 921 (N.Y. 2010). "[C]onclusive
evidence of lack of actual authority [is] sufficiently dispositive that the [trial court] 'ha|s] no
option but to dismiss the case...'' Id. (emphasis supplied; quoting Rinaldi v. Viking Penguin,
Inc., 420 N.E.2d 377, 382 (N.Y. 1981)).
It is undisputed Ms. Maxwell and her agents had no ability to control and did not control
whether or how the media-recipients would use the statement. Doc. 542-7, Ex.J 19 2-3; id., Ex.K
9 24. Unsurprisingly, plaintiff has offered no evidence of such control. A fortiori this Court
"ha[s] no option but to dismiss the case," id. (internal quotations omitted), to the extent it is
founded upon the media's republication of the statement.
A. Plaintiff's argument against summary judgment is substantially groundless.
A legal argument is frivolous if it is presented contrary to a "long line of authorities" and
the "fundamental principles" of the underlying substantive law. Plaintiff Giuffre's argument
opposing summary judgment as to republication is frivolous.
The New York Court of Appeals in Geraci followed a long line of New York cases
holding that a defamation defendant is not liable for republication of his allegedly defamatory
statement unless he had "actual authority" to control the decision to republish: "Our
'Porky Prods. v. Nippon Exp. U.S.A., 1 F.Supp.2d 227, 234 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff'd, 152
F.3d 920 (2d Cir. 1998).
2


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page8 of 37
republication liability standard has been consistent for more than one hundred years." See
Geraci, 938 N.E.2d at 921 (footnote omitted). Indeed, the Geraci court observed, the New York
Court of Appeals in Schoepflin v. Coffey, a case decided in 1900, held:
"It is too well settled to be now questioned that one who .... prints and publishes a
libel[] is not responsible for its voluntary and unjustifiable repetition, without his
authority or request, by others over whom he has no control and who thereby
make themselves liable to the person injured, and that such repetition cannot be
considered in law a necessary, natural and probable consequence of the original
slander or libel."
938 N.E.2d at 921 (emphasis supplied; quoting Schoepflin, 56 N.E. at 504).
The cases in which this Court and its sister courts in this Circuit assiduously have
followed this line of New York cases are legion. The Second Circuit was in the vanguard.*
256 N.E. 502 (N.Y. 1900).
3See Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 880 F. Supp. 2d 494, 501 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) ("It]he original
publisher is not liable for republication where he had 'nothing to do with the decision to
[republish] and [he] had no control over it."") (quoting Rinaldi v. Viking Penguin, Inc., 425
N. Y.S.2d 101, 104 (15 Dep't 1980), aff'd, 420 N.E.2d 377 (N.Y. 1981)); Egiazaryan v.
Zalmayev, No. 11 CIV. 2670 PKC, 2011 WL 6097136, at *5 (S.D.N. Y. Dec. 7, 2011) (same);
Davis v. Costa-Gavras, 595 F. Supp. 982, 988 (S.D.N. Y. 1984) ('Under New York law, liability
for a subsequent republication must be based on real authority to influence the final product, not
upon evidence of acquiescence or peripheral involvement in the republication process."); Davis,
580 F. Supp. at 1094 (original publisher not liable for injuries caused by the republication
''absent a showing that they approved or participated in some other manner in the activities of
the third party republisher") (quoting Karaduman v. Newsday, Inc., 416 N.E.2d 557, 560 (N.Y.
1980)); Croy v. A.O. Fox Mem'l Hosp., 68 F. Supp. 2d 136, 144 (N.D.N.Y. 1999) ("The original
author of a document may not be held personally liable for injuries arising from its subsequent
may not be het pesonaly li
republication absent a showing that the original author approved or participated in some other
manner in the activities of the third-party republisher.") (citations omitted); Cerasani v. Sony
Corp., 991 F. Supp. 343, 351 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) ("a libel plaintiff must allege that the party had
authority or control over, or somehow ratified or approved, the republication").
4See Folwell v. Miller, 145 F. 495, 497 (2d Cir. 1906) (affirming directed verdict in favor
of managing editor: "when it appears affirmatively that he was not on duty [upon receipt of
libelous matter and its republication], and could not have had any actual part in composing or
publishing, we think he cannot be held liable without disregarding the settled rule of law by
which no man is bound for the tortious act of another over whom he has not a master's power of
control") (emphasis supplied), quoted with approval in Davis I, 580 F. Supp. at 1096; Cerasani,
991 F. Supp. at 351.

Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page9 of 37
In the face of this uninterrupted line of New York state (and federal) cases dating back to
the nineteenth century powerfully establishing a bright line rule regarding republication liability,
plaintiff Giuffre manages what amounts to a-
—frivolous-murmur of opposition. She claims
there are "[t]wo standards" in New York law: one "older," and one "more modern." Resp. 28.
The "older" standard, plaintiff says, is represented by the legion of cases we have cited. The
"more modern formulation" —where can it be found? Why, in one place: a treatise on
defamation. Id. (citing Sack on Defamation § 2.7.2, at 2-113 to -114 (4'"' ed. 2016)). It surely is
frivolous to argue that a treatise creates a republication-liability standard that is separate from,
"more modern" than, and supersedes the New York Court of Appeals' 2010 decision in Geraci
and this Court's 2012 decision in Egiazaryan.
Trying to build on this start, plaintiff argues, "New York appellate courts have repeatedly
held than an individual is liable for the media publishing that individual's defamatory press
release. " Resp. 28 (emphasis supplied). Even if we accept plaintiff's mischaracterization of the
January 2015 statement as a "press release," her argument still would be meritless. To begin
with, when plaintiff says the New York appellate courts have "repeatedly" supported her claimed
rule of law, she means ... twice. And an examination of those two cases reveals she is quite
wrong and, worse, has advanced a seriously misleading argument. Neither case involved, as here,
a motion for summary judgment. In both cases, the New York appellate division affirmed the
denial of a motion to dismiss under the state's equivalent of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(b)(6). See Levy v. Smith, 18 N. Y.S.3d 438, 439 (2d Dep't 2015); National Puerto Rican Day
Parade, Inc. v. Casa Pubs. ("NPR"), 914 N.Y.S.2d 120, 122-23 (15' Dep't 2010).
'As discussed in This Reply, at 16-19, the January 2015 statement would be a strange
"press release," as it threatened to sue the very press to which it was "releasing" information.


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page10 of 37
This argument, too, is frivolous. Despite plaintiff's baseless claim there is an "old"
formulation and a "more modern" formulation of republication-liability law in New York, both
cases she cites applied the same "old" standard used by the New York Court of Appeals in
Geraci, by this Court in the two Egiazaryan cases, and by us in our Memorandum of Law in
support of Ms. Maxwell's motion for summary judgment. See Levy, 18 N.Y.S.3d at 439 (citing
Geraci and Schoepflin); NPR, 914 N.Y.S.2d at 594-95 (citing Hoffman v. Landers, 537 N. Y.S.2d
228, 231 (2d Dep't 1989) (citing Schoepflin)).
Both the courts in Levy and NPR applied the Geraci standard and the 12(b)(6) standards,
e.g., assuming the pleaded facts were true. They concluded it was possible to infer from the
complaints' allegations that the defendant caused the republications. Accordingly, they denied
the motions to dismiss. See Levy, 18 N. Y.S.2d at 439; NPR, 914 N. Y.S.2d at 123. It was
improper for plaintiff to cite these cases without disclosing they are 12(b)(6) cases in which the
courts applied the Geraci republication rule and inferred facts from the pleaded allegations.
B. New York state and federal courts have rejected liability for republication
based on "foreseeability"
Plaintiff cites section 576 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts for the proposition that if
republication was foreseeable, then the defendant is the cause of any special damages from the
republication. This argument is frivolous. As an initial matter, plaintiff has pleaded no special
damages. See Doc.1; Doc.23 at 23; Doc.37 at 17.
Regardless, the New York Court of Appeals in Geraci rejected the Restatement's
foreseeability doctrine. See 938 N.E.2d at 921-22 (noting that section 576's foreseeability
standard "is not nearly as broad as plaintiff... suggest[s]" and "[t]hat we did not endorse such a
broad [Restatement] standard of foreseeability in Karaduman is evident from our decision the
following year in Rinaldi") (emphasis supplied).
5


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page11 of 37
While trying to distinguish this Court's decision in Davis, plaintiff fails to disclose that
Davis itself-decided 26 years before Geraci-also rejected plaintiff's foreseeability argument.
The Davis plaintiffs, like plaintiff Giuffre here, also asserted republication liability, despite
defendant's lack of participation, on the ground "he could reasonably have foreseen that
republication would occur." 580 F.Supp. at 1096. This Court, relying on Karaduman, was
unpersuaded: The New York Court of Appeals "has not applied the foreseeability standard
suggested by plaintiffs in prior libel cases in which such a standard would have been relevant, if
not controlling." Id. This Court noted: The jurisdictions that have adopted a foreseeability
standard "have refused to hold responsible a defendant with no control or influence over the
entity that actually republished the statement." Id. Plaintiff's failure to disclose this Court's
holdings in Davis is a notable lapse in candor.
C. Plaintiff's purported application of the Geraci rule is misleading and wrong.
Plaintiff eventually purports to apply the "old" standard, that is to say, the controlling law
in the state of New York. She argues Ms. Maxwell "authorized" the January 2015 statement,
"paid money to her publicist to convince media outlets to publish it," "request[ed]" its
publication, "made a deliberate decision to publish her press release," "actively participated" in
"the decision to publish her press release," was "active" in "influencing the media to publish" the
statement, and "approved of" and "pushed for" the publication of the statement. Resp. 30-31.
These argument-manufactured facts have no record support.
In applying the controlling law, plaintiff wittingly makes a mess of it. She disingenuously
suggests any help Ms. Maxwell gave to help her lawyer prepare the January 2015 statement and
her signing-off on it are the equivalent of requesting, authorizing and controlling its
republication. That isn't the law. The "authority" required for republication liability is the
"actual authority.... to decide upon or implement" the republication. 580 F.Supp. at 1095
6


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page12 of 37
(emphasis supplied; citing Rinaldi, 420 N.E.2d at 382). Judge Sofaer studied Rinaldi's holding,
and noted republication liability must be based on a "decision" by the defendant to republish and
must focus on "real authority to influence the final product, not upon evidence of acquiescence
or peripheral involvement in the republication process." Id. at 1096 (emphasis supplied).
Accordingly, Judge Sofaer held, when there is "conclusive evidence of lack of actual authority"
this is "dispositive" of republication liability and the trial court "'ha[s] no option but to dismiss
the case against the [defendant]." Id. (emphasis supplied; quoting Rinaldi, 420 N.E.2d at 382).
There is no evidence Ms. Maxwell "paid money to her publicist to convince" the media
to publish her statement; this is why plaintiff cites no evidence to support that assertion. See
Resp. 30. Mr. Gow's email containing the statement says nothing to "convince" the media to
publish the statement. See Doc.542-6, Ex.F. There is no evidence Ms. Maxwell was "active" in
"influencing the media to publish" it; nor is there any evidence she "pushed for" or "requested"
its publication; this is why plaintiff cites no evidence to support these assertions. See id. 31.
Indeed, plaintiff has zero evidence Ms. Maxwell or her agents ever did anything to urge
or request any media to publish the statement. Mr. Gow presented the January 2015 statement
via email to six to thirty media representatives; it was not sent to anyone else; in the email he
told the journalists he was presenting a "quotable statement" "on behalf of" Ms. Maxwell and
"[njo further communication will be provided." Doc.542-6, Ex.F. It is undisputed Ms. Maxwell
and her agents had no control over the media that republished portions of the statement.
Doc.542-7, 542-7, Ex.J 19 2-3; id., Ex.K 91 24.
Plaintiff argues "a jury" should decide whether Ms. Maxwell "authorized or intended"
the statement to be republished, or "approved of, and even participated, in" its republication.
Resp. 30-31. All plaintiffs want to get to "a jury." The summary-judgment question is whether
they deserve to. Plaintiff has offered no evidence to put before a jury on the dispositive Geraci
7


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page13 of 37
question: whether Ms. Maxwell affirmatively authorized or requested a person or entity "over
whom [s]he has ... control," 938 N.E.2d at 921. The only new argument plaintiff makes in her
entreaty to see "a jury" is that she should be permitted to prove Ms. Maxwell's "complicity." As
with her other factually bereft arguments, the complicity argument awaits plaintiff's introduction
of facts to support it. Having failed to do so, plaintiff cannot avoid summary judgment.
Plaintiff labors in vain to turn the Barden Declaration into "disputed issues of fact." For
there to be a disputed factual issue, plaintiff would need to introduce evidence disputing his
sworn statements. She has not done so. In any event, the Barden Declaration is all but irrelevant
to the central, dispositive republication question: whether Ms. Maxwell is liable for the media's
republication of her statement, where they did so without her authority or request and where she
and her agents had "no control"
over the media. On this question we cited to the Barden
Declaration for one evidentiary fact: Messrs. Barden and Gow had no control over the media?
See Doc. 542-7, Ex. K 9| 24, cited in Memo. of Law 14. Plaintiff has offered no admissible
evidence disputing this fact.
"[T]here is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving
party for a jury to return a verdict for that party." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,
249 (1986). It is one thing to argue in conclusory fashion, as plaintiff does, that "a jury" should
decide a factual question. It is quite another to identify evidence in the Rule 56 record that raises
a genuine question of material fact, which plaintiff does not do. Summary judgment is warranted.
'Geraci, 938 N.E.2d at 921.
As discussed in Argument I.D., below, we cited more plenarily to the Barden
Declaration in connection with a different point—the particular unfairness of subjecting
Ms. Maxwell to liability when the media selectively quoted portions of the January 15 statement.
"In the Memorandum, we erroneously cited to 9 24 of Exhibit J; we intended to cite to
9 24 of Exhibit K (Doc.542-1, Ex.K), which is Mr. Barden's declaration.


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page14 of 37
D. Subjecting Ms. Maxwell to liability for the media's republication of excerpts
they unilaterally selected is particularly unfair.
It is undisputed that no one ever republished in toto the January 2015 statement and that
various media unilaterally selected portions of the statement to republish. We said on page 14 of
our Memorandum that the media's "selective, partial republication of the statement is more
problematic yet" (emphasis altered). That is to say, as improper as it is to hold a publisher of a
statement liable for republications over which she had no control, worse is it to make her liable
for selective, partial republications of her statement. We relied on the holding in Rand v. New
York Times Co., 430 N. Y.S.2d 271, 275 (15 Dep't 1980), that a publisher cannot be charged with
a republisher's "editing and excerpting of her statement." Memo. of Law 14.
Plaintiff argues that our position is "absurd on its face" because "[i]t would mean... a
defamer could send to the media a long attack on a victim with one irrelevant sentence and, when
the media quite predictably cut that sentence, escape liability." Resp. 32. This argument has two
erroneous assumptions. One is that the "defamer" can "escape liability." Not true. An original
publisher remains liable for her defamation. We are concerned here with republication. The
second wrong assumption is that the original publisher must always remain liable for any
republication. Geraci rejects that view: Under New York law "each person who repeats the
defamatory statement is responsible for the resulting damages." 938 N.E.2d at 921.
The effort by plaintiff to distinguish Rand is meritless. She argues the media's
republication of the January 2015 statement actually was not a republication at all, just an
original publication. Resp. 32. That argument is "absurd on its face," id., since there is no dispute
Ms. Maxwell did not control the media's decision to republish (excerpts from) the statement.
Plaintiff next argues the media did not "edit[]" or "tak[e] ... quote[s] out of context." Id.
Plaintiff could not be more wrong. As she concedes, all republications of the statement by the
9


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page15 of 37
media were selective, partial republications of the statement. Any such selective, partial
republication by definition took those excerpts "out of context." This is so because Mr. Gow
informed the media in his email that he was providing "a quotable statement," Doc. 542-6, Ex.F,
not a statement "from which you, the media, are free to excerpt as you please."
More importantly, as Mr. Barden explained, selectively excerpting the statement
substantially altered his message. See id., Ex. K 1 20. For example, when he said in the third
paragraph that plaintiff's claims are "obvious lies," it followed two paragraphs in which he
explained why it was obvious the new claims are lies. See id., Ex.K 1 19-22. Excerpting and
republishing only the "obvious lies" phrase as plaintiff did in her complaint certainly gives
the reader a different understanding than if the media had republished the entire statement. As
Rand held: A defendant cannot be liable for the republication of derogatory but constitutionally
protected opinion "when the foundation upon which that opinion is based is omitted. The
defamatory remark should be read against the background of its issuance." 430 N.Y.S.2d at 275
(internal quotations omitted).
Plaintiff argues: "A jury could reasonably conclude that [Ms. Maxwell's] statement that
Ms. Giuffre's claims of child sexual abuse are 'obvious lies' is not a rhetorical device, nor
hyperbole, but a literal and particular affirmation that [plaintiff] lied." Resp. 33 (emphasis
supplied). We italicize plaintiff's rhetorical sleight of hand. As plaintiff knows, nowhere did the
January 2015 statement specify which of plaintiff's countless allegations are "obvious lies."
Indeed, this is the problem with plaintiff's case: since the statement specified no particular
allegations as obvious lies, plaintiff believes she is entitled to "prove" the truth of every
allegation she ever has made about her alleged experience as a "sex slave." What Mr. Barden's
declaration makes clear is he deliberately made no reference to any specific allegation by
plaintiff. He had a bigger target: plaintiff's credibility. He used the statement to show plaintiff's
10


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page16 of 37
behavior is that of a liar, i.e., one who increasingly embellishes her story, and her allegations
become more and more outlandish, so that by January 2015 she was claiming to have had sex
with a well respected Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K 11 19-22.
Contrary to plaintiff's argument, "even apparent statements of fact may assume the
character of statements of opinion, and thus be privileged, when made in public debate ... or
other circumstances in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or
hyperbole." Steinhilber v. Alphonse, 501 N.E.2d 550, 556 (N.Y. 1986) (internal quotations and
brackets omitted). That was the case here. Plaintiff falsely-and, as Judge Marra held,
"unnecessarily]'' —alleged in lurid detail that Ms. Maxwell had sexually abused her. The six to
thirty journalists would have anticipated a "fiery" denial of the allegations. Regardless, the
statement overall was constitutionally protected opinion grounded on facts disclosed to the
journalists: plaintiff's increasingly outlandish and inconsistent stories, her newly embellished
allegations, and her increasingly lurid and salacious enhancements of her earlier allegations.
E. Mr. Barden's declaration is perfectly proper.
Plaintiff makes a plethora of complaints about Mr. Barden's declarations. None has any
merit. She objects to Mr. Barden's declaration of his intent and purposes for preparing the
January 2015 statement because, she says, this implicates the attorney-client privilege. That is
untrue. His intent and purposes are by definition not attorney-client communications and do not
implicate such communications; they are attorney work product, ' which he is free to disclose."

She objects he is "non-deposed." But Mr. Barden was the third-listed potential witness in
our Rule 26(a)(1)(A) disclosure, served on plaintiff a year ago; the disclosure said he "has
knowledge concerning press statements by ... Defendant in 2011-2015 at issue in this matter. "12
Plaintiff was free to depose him; that she chose not to was her own tactical decision. Finally,
plaintiff argues "there are factual disputes" regarding the declaration. But plaintiff identified no
such factual disputes relating to the declaration. A party opposing summary judgment cannot
create a dispute by arguing, which is all plaintiff does. See Resp. 35-38.
F. Plaintiff effectively has confessed Arguments I.B. and I.C. of the Memorandum.
Argument I.B. of the Memorandum contends the First Amendment bars liability for
republication by media organizations of the January 2015 statement. See Memo. of Law 16-17.
Argument I.C. contends that under Geraci plaintiff is barred from introducing into evidence any
of the media organizations' republication of the January 2015 statement. See id. at 17-18.
Plaintiff offers no resistance to these arguments. We respectfully request that the Court consider
these arguments confessed. See, e.g., Cowan v. City of Mount Vernon, 95 F. Supp. 3d 624, 645-
46 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing cases).
II. The January 2015 statement is constitutionally protected opinion.
In deciding whether a statement is opinion the New York Constitution requires
application of "the widely used four-part Ollman'3! formula," Immuno AG v. Moor-Jankowski,
567 N.E.2d 1270, 1274 (N.Y. 1991). See id. at 1274, 1277-78, 1280-82 (noting Steinhilber's
adoption of formula). We addressed each of the four Ollman factors. The plaintiff avoids this
analysis, choosing merely to block-quote large portions of this Court's Rule 12(b)(6) order. That
"Menninger Decl. ExHIBIT NN, at 2.
13 Ollman v. Evans, 750 F.2d 970 (D.C. Cir. 1984).
12


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page18 of 37
is a mistake. Immuno AG is the seminal case prescribing the analysis to be used in a summary-
judgment proceeding for assessing whether under the New York Constitution a statement is
absolutely protected as opinion.
Instead of addressing the four factors, plaintiff simply relies on this Court's 12(b)(6)
order. The Court's order does not control. In deciding the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court
assumed the complaint's allegations were true and drew all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's
favor. In this proceeding, plaintiff is not entitled either to the assumption or the inferences. The
opinion-versus-fact question will be controlled by the Rule 56 record.
Relying on the Court's order, plaintiff argues that the question whether the three
allegedly defamatory sentences are opinion or fact is controlled by Davis v. Boeheim, 22 N.E.3d
999 (N.Y. 2014), and Green v. Cosby, 138 F. Supp. 3d 114 (D. Mass. 2015). See Resp. 38. Davis
was an appeal from a 12(b)(6) dismissal. This procedural posture was critical to its decision:
[D]efendants argue that because a reader could interpret the statement as pure
opinion, the statement is as a consequence, nonactionable and was properly
dismissed [pursuant to a pre-answer motion]. However, on a motion to dismiss we
consider whether any reading of the complaint supports the defamation claim.
Thus, although it may well be that the challenged statements are subject to
defendants' interpretation, the motion to dismiss must be denied if the
communication at issue, taking the words in their ordinary meaning and in
context, is also susceptible to a defamatory connotation. We find this complaint to
meet this minimum pleading requirement.
Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1006-07 (internal quotations, brackets, ellipsis and citations omitted).
Green was a decision on the defendant's motion to dismiss. The case was decided under
California and Florida defamation law. See 138 F. Supp. 3d at 124, 130, 136-37. The court made
it clear the 12(b)(6) procedural posture was critical to its decision: "At this stage of the litigation,
the court's concern is whether any fact contained in or implied by an allegedly defamatory
statement is susceptible to being proved true or false; if so capable, Defendant cannot avoid
application of defamation law by claiming the statement expresses only opinion." Id. at 130.
13


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page19 of 37
In the case at bar, application of the four Steinhilber factors on the Rule 56 record
compels a different conclusion. The complaint alleges three sentences in the January 2015
statement are defamatory: in the first paragraph of the statement, plaintiff Giuffre's allegations
are "untrue"; in the same paragraph, the "original allegations" have been "shown to be untrue";
and in the third paragraph, plaintiff's "claims are obvious lies."4 Doc. 1 9 30.
Factor 1: Indefiniteness and ambiguity. On the face of the complaint in a 12(b)(6)
proceeding, the words "untrue" and "obvious lies" might be susceptible of "a specific and readily
understood factual meaning," Doc.37 at 9. This is especially true if it is taken out of context, e.g.,
extracted from the statement. But this approach is forbidden. See, e.g., Law Firm of Daniel P.
Foster, P.C. v. Turner Broad. Sys., 844 F.2d 955, 959 (2d Cir. 1988).
The first sentence— "[t]he allegations made by [plaintiff] against [Ms. Maxwell] are
untrue"—is indefinite and ambiguous because it is wholly unclear which "allegations" are being
referenced. The second sentence—"[t]he original allegations ... have been fully responded to
and shown to be untrue"—also is indefinite and ambiguous for the same reason. Additionally, it
is unclear what are the "original" allegations. It is unclear what is meant by "shown to be
untrue." What one person may believe is a fact shown to be untrue, another person may believe
is a fact not (sufficiently) shown to be untrue. The existence of God, climate change and
existence of widespread voter fraud in the election are examples of this. The third sentence—
14Ms. Maxwell testified in her deposition that she "know[s]" plaintiff is a "liar." This
testimony, plaintiff argues, "contradict[s]" our contention that the three allegedly defamatory
sentences in the July 2015 statement are opinion. Resp. 39-40. Plaintiff's argument is a non-
sequitur. Ms. Maxwell's 2016 deposition testimony in which she disclosed all the reasons she
believes plaintiff has uttered a plethora of false allegations is irrelevant to whether the three
sentences in the July 2015 statement, prepared by Mr. Barden to respond to the joint-motion
allegations, are opinions.
14


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page20 of 37
"[plaintiff's] claims are obvious lies"—also is indefinite and ambiguous. An "obvious lie" to one
person is not an "obvious lie" to another.
Factor 2: Capable of being characterized as true or false. On the 12(b)(6) record, the
Court held the three statements "are capable of being proven true or false." Doc.37 at 9. As a
general question of law, one person's statement that another person's allegations are "untrue" or
are "obvious lies" is not necessarily capable of being proved true or false-regardless of the
subject matter of the opined "untruths" or "lies." See Rizzuto v. Nexxus Prod. Co., 641 F. Supp.
473, 481 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), aff'd, 810 F.2d 1161 (2d Cir. 1986); Telephone Sys. Int'l v. Cecil, No.
02 CV 9315(GBD), 2003 WL 22232908, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2003); Memo. of Law 35
(citing cases). As Steinhilber observed, "even apparent statements of fact may assume the
character of statements of opinion, and thus be privileged." 501 N.E.2d at 556.
At least two of plaintiff's CVRA allegations cannot be proven true or false (only two
such allegations are needed in order to render the January 15 statement an opinion). We have
identified two such allegations in the joinder motion: that Ms. Maxwell "appreciated the
immunity granted" to Epstein, and that she "act[ed] as a 'madame' for Epstein." Memo. of Law
22. Plaintiff does not dispute this. The result is that the January 15 statement's assertion that
plaintiff's "allegations" and "claims" in the joint motion are "untrue" or "obvious lies" is by
definition an opinion. It cannot be proven true or false whether Ms. Maxwell "appreciated"
Epstein's immunity or whether she "acted as a madame." Indeed, it seems quite obvious that the
joinder-motion allegations about "appreciation" and "madame" are themselves opinion.
In the statement, Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell also says plaintiff's "original
allegations ... have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue." Doc.542-6, Ex.F. This
cannot be proven true or false. The "full response" to the original allegations is a reference to the
"Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell" issued March 9, 2011, in response to plaintiff's
15


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page21 of 37
allegations contained in media stories, including the Churcher articles. See Doc.542-3, Ex.C.
Whether the 2011 statement "fully" responded to the original allegations and whether it
"showed" the original allegations to be untrue are pure (argumentative) opinion. "[O]bvious lies"
on its face is an opinion. The "obviousness" of a lie simply cannot be proven true or false.
Factor 3: The full context of the statement. Three contextual facts are revealed by the
Rule 56 record. One, the email transmitting the statement to the media-representatives-along
with the third-person references to Ms. Maxwell-told them Ms. Maxwell did not prepare the
statement: "Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell." Doc.542-6,
Ex.F (emphasis supplied). It is undisputed that in fact Mr. Barden prepared the bulk of it and
ultimately approved and adopted as his work all of it. Doc.542-7, Ex.K 1 10.
Two, Mr. Barden's statement issued on behalf of his client would not be a traditional
press release solely to disseminate information to the media; this is why he did not request
Mr. Gow or any other public relations specialist to prepare or participate in preparing the
statement. Id., Ex.K 1 15. The statement was a broad-brush communique to the media about
plaintiff and her new allegations; it was not to be a "point by point" rebuttal of each new
allegation. Id., Ex.K 1 13. The logic and approach to preparing the statement were simple:
compare plaintiff's prior allegations and conduct in telling her story with her current allegations
and conduct. See generally id., Ex.K 1 13. When he wrote the statement, he knew of plaintiff's
2011 allegation that she had not had sex with Prince Andrew and he knew of her CVRA
allegation that she did have sex with him. Id., Ex.K 1| 14. Also within his knowledge was the
story she had told Churcher before March 2011—a story that was far less provocative and
salacious than the one she included in the joinder motion. See id., Ex.K 9 5; compare Docs.542-1
& 542-2, Exs.A & B (Churcher articles published March 2011) with Doc.542-4, Ex. D (plaintiff's
joinder motion containing dramatically different and more lurid and salacious allegations).
16


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page22 of 37
Mr. Barden's approach provides critical context to explaining how the statement builds a
logical argument that the new allegations are false. It first notes plaintiff's "original allegations";
then it points out how the story changed and was embellished over time, "now" with allegations
that plaintiff had sex with a prominent and highly respected Harvard law professor ("Each time
the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about public figures and world
leaders ...."). The argument builds up to the opinion in the third paragraph: "[Plaintiff's] claims
are obvious lies and should be treated as such...." Doc.542-6, Ex.F. See generally id., Ex.K
19 13-22. This third paragraph and the threat in the fourth paragraph to sue the media for
republication of plaintiff's falsehoods-confirms what is plain from the statement itself: it was
not a traditional press release.
Three, the statement was intended to respond (via denial) to the media-recipients'
requests for a reply to the new CVRA joinder-motion allegations. Id. 19 8, 10, 16. But more than
that, it was intended to be "a shot across the bow" of the media. Id. 9 17. The logical argument
was created to (a) persuade the media-recipients that they needed to "subject plaintiff's
allegations to inquiry and scrutiny"; (b) explain to the media-recipients how it was "obvious"
that plaintiff "had no credibility" because of her shifting story and increasingly lurid and
salacious allegations as time went on, many of which (e.g., the allegations of sex with Prince
Andrew and Professor Dershowitz) on their face appear far-fetched,' and (c) warn the media-
'Since the CVRA joinder motion, there has emerged a substantial amount of evidence—
some from plaintiff's own pen—that plaintiff's allegations about having been "forced" to have
sex with prominent individuals are falsehoods. A telling example is a series of emails between
plaintiff and reporter Churcher when plaintiff was working on negotiating a book deal about her
alleged experiences and Churcher was trying to help her. On May 10, 2011, plaintiff tells
Churcher she cannot remember whom she had told Churcher she had had sex with. Churcher
responds responds, "Don't forget Alan Dershowitz," which Churcher says is a "good name for
[plaintiff's] pitch" to her literary agent. It is clear neither Churcher nor plaintiff believed plaintiff
(footnote cont'd on next page)
17


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page23 of 37
recipients that they republished plaintiff's obvious falsehoods against Ms. Maxwell at their legal
peril. See id. 1 13, 16, 17, 20.
As the New York Court of Appeals observed, the context of a statement often is the "key
consideration" in fact vs. opinion cases. Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1006. So it is here. As Davis
suggested, the three challenged statements are "subject to [Ms. Maxwell's] interpretation," id. at
1007; accord Sweeney v. Prisoners' Legal Servs. of N.Y., 538 N.Y.S.2d 370, 371-72 (3d Dep't
1989). The context of the January 2015 statement makes clear that the characterization of
plaintiff's allegations and claims as "untrue" or "obvious lies" are ultimate opinions—
conclusions-drawn from disclosed facts.
Factor 4: The broader setting surrounding the statement, including conventions that
might signal to readers that the statement likely is opinion and not fact. It is undisputed that
the January 2015 statement was sent exclusively to more than six and fewer than thirty media
representatives, each of whom expressly had requested from Mr. Gow that he provide them with
Ms. Maxwell's reply to the new joint-motion allegations. Doc.542-7, Ex.K 111 8, 10. As was
obvious from the statement, it was not a traditional press release, as such a release does not
explain-lawyer-like—why new allegations when measured against previous allegations lack
credibility. Nor does a traditional release threaten to sue the media to whom the release is sent.
The media representatives upon receiving the January 2015 statement would have understood it
was presenting an (opinionated) argument that plaintiff was not credible because of her
had had sex with Professor Dershowitz, since (a) Churcher suggests that he would be a "good
name" to "pitch" because of his prominence ('he [represented] Claus von Bulow and a movie
was made about that case...title was Reversal of Fortune"), and (b) Churcher states, "We all
suspect [Professor Dershowitz] is a pedo[phile] and tho no proof of that, you probably met him
when he was hanging put w [Epstein]." Menninger Decl., EXHIBIT. 00, at Giuffre004096-97
(emphasis supplied).
18


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page24 of 37
inconsistent and shifting sex abuse story and her increasingly lurid allegations against more and
more prominent individuals. And they would have understood that these characteristics of a
storyteller undermine her credibility and ergo the credibility of her new allegations.
In its 12(b)(6) order the Court said the three sentences have the effect of denying
plaintiff's story but "they also clearly constitute fact to the reader." The ruling is affected in two
ways by the Rule 56 record. Based on the foregoing discussion of the evidence, the three
sentences clearly constitute (argumentative) opinions of Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.
Though the Court did not discuss who is "the reader," this is important in Steinhilber
Factor 4." Under settled defamation-opinion law, an allegedly defamatory statement is to be
viewed "from the perspective of the audience to whom it is addressed." Dibella v. Hopkins, No.
01 CIV. 11779 (DC), 2002 WL 31427362, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2002). Here, "the reader" is
six to thirty journalists. They could not have read the July 2015 statement or the three allegedly
defamatory sentences
-the same way it was read by these journalists' audience, i.e., the general
public. This is because, as plaintiff implicitly concedes, these journalists only republished
excerpts and not the entirety of the statement, which would have given context to the three
sentences. It is axiomatic that an out-of-context republication of the three sentences—without the
rest of the statement—would deprive the reader of the logic and reasoning behind the
opinionated conclusion that plaintiff was making "untrue" allegations and telling "obvious lies."

III. The pre-litigation privilege bars this action.
A. The privilege applies to the January 2015 statement.
Statements pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation made by attorneys (or their
agents under their direction'°) before the commencement of litigation are privileged and "no
cause of action for defamation can be based on those statements," Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 28
N.E.3d 15, 16 (N.Y. 2015). The facts that must be established, therefore, are (a) a statement,
(b) that is pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation, and (c) by attorneys or their agents
under their direction. We did this. See Memo. of Law 6-8, 33-38; Doc.542-7, Ex.K 11l 8-30. For
example, Mr. Barden (a) drafted the vast majority of the January 2015 statement and approved
and adopted all of it, (b) directed Mr. Gow to send it to the media representatives who had
requested Ms. Maxwell's reply to plaintiff's joint-motion allegations, (c) in the statement
threatened legal action again these media representatives, and (d) at the time of the statement
"was contemplating litigation against the press-recipients." Id., Ex.K 99 10, 16-17, 28, 30.
Plaintiff argues without citation to authority: Ms. Maxwell herself did not testify she
intended to sue; she hasn't offered any witnesses to testify she intended to bring a lawsuit; she
didn't in fact sue; and—this one is a non-sequitur-the statement was an "attempt] to continue
to conceal her criminal acts." Resp. 41-42. These arguments fail. The privilege exists without
regard to whether Ms. Maxwell testifies she "intended" to sue, whether she has "witnesses" to
say she intended to sue, or whether she "in fact" sued. It refers to "anticipated" litigation, not
"guaranteed" litigation. Indeed, the point of the pre-litigation privilege is to promote
communications that avoid litigation. See Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19 ("When litigation is
'See Chambers v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. CV 15-6976 (JBS/JS), 2016 WL
3533998, at *8 (D.N.J. June 28, 2016); see generally Hawkins v. Harris, 661 A.2d 284, 289-91
(N.J. 1995).
20


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page26 of 37
anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to communicate in order to reduce or avoid the
need to actually commence litigation."). It applies when there is a good faith basis to anticipate
litigation. Mr. Barden, Ms. Maxwell's lawyer who drafted and caused the statement to be sent
out, actually was anticipating litigation. Doc.542-7, Ex.K | 28. The argument that the statement
was an attempt to "conceal" Ms. Maxwell's "criminal acts" is fatuous. It would be hard to post
facto "conceal" alleged criminal acts that plaintiff luridly and salaciously described in an earlier
public filing, i.e., in the CVRA case, in which the United States government was the defendant.
Citing no record evidence, plaintiff argues, "The record evidence shows [Mr. Barden] did
not make the [January 2015] statement." Resp. 42. That argument is easily disposed of by
Mr. Barden's uncontested testimony. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K 19l 10-13, 15-17, 20, 26-28, 30.
B. Malice is irrelevant to the pre-litigation privilege.
Citing the New York Court of Appeals' decision in Khalil, we pointed out that malice is
not relevant to the pre-litigation privilege. Memo. of Law 34-35. To prevail on the pre-litigation
privilege the defendant need only establish one element: the allegedly defamatory statement at
issue was "pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation.'" Id. (quoting Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at
16). Plaintiff disputes this and, without discussing Khalil or citing authorities, simply argues the
pre-litigation privilege is "foreclosed ... because [Ms. Maxwell] acted with malice." Resp. 43.
As suggested by her inability to find any law to support her, plaintiff is wrong.
Under general New York defamation law, "It]he shield provided by a qualified privilege
may be dissolved" if plaintiff in rebuttal can show that the defendant "spoke with 'malice."
Liberman v. Gelstein, 605 N.E.2d 344, 349 (N.Y. 1992); accord Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19.
"Malice" means two things: spite or ill will, and knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of
falsity. Liberman, 605 N.E.2d at 349. Plaintiff relies on this general qualified-privilege law.
21


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page27 of 37
The problem for plaintiff is that in Khalil the New York Court of Appeals held this
general rule does not apply to the pre-litigation privilege. Khalil worked for a company named
Front. After eight years, he resigned and began working for "EOC," one of Front's competitors.
Front's lawyer Kimmel sent a demand letter to Khalil alleging he had committed criminal,
tortious and ethical misconduct. Kimmel sent another demand letter to EOC and others stating
Khalil had conspired with EOC to breach his fiduciary duty to Front. Six months later, Front
sued Khalil. Khalil brought a third-party claim against Kimmel for libel per se. The trial court
dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the letters were "absolutely privileged" under the litigation
privilege "and that it therefore did not need to reach the question of malice." 28 N.E.3d at 17
(internal quotations omitted). The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that the litigation
privilege absolutely protected the letter "because they were issued in the context of prospective
litigation." Id. at 18 (internal quotations omitted).
The Court of Appeals affirmed, but altered the law on the litigation privilege. It observed,
"Although it is well-settled that statements made in the course of litigation are entitled to
absolute privilege, this Court has not directly addressed whether statements made by an attorney
on behalf of his or her client in connection with prospective litigation are privileged." Id.
(emphasis supplied). Some Appellate Division departments had held the absolute privilege
applies to statements made in connection with prospective litigation, but other departments had
held such statements were entitled only to a qualified privilege. Id.
The answer to whether pre-litigation statements should be absolute or qualified, the Court
of Appeals held, is driven by the rationale for protecting pre-litigation statements:
When litigation is anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to
communicate in order to reduce or avoid the need to actually commence
tigation. Attorneys often send cease and desist letters to avoid litigation...
'ommunication during this pre-litigation phase should be encouraged and no
chilled by the possibility of being the basis for a defamation suit.
22


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page28 of 37
Id. at 19. However, the court recognized that "extending privileged status to communication
made prior to anticipated litigation has the potential to be abused"; extending an absolute
privilege to this context, the court said, "would be problematic and unnecessary." Id.
The court held it would recognize only a qualified privilege for pre-litigation
communications. Id. Crucially to the case at bar, the court held that the traditional privilege-
rebuttal malice was inapplicable to the pre-litigation privilege:
Rather than applying the general malice standard to this pre-litigation stage, the
privilege should only be applied to statements pertinent to a good faith anticipated
litigation. This requirement ensures that privilege does not protect attorneys who
are seeking to bully, harass, or intimidate their client's adversaries by threatening
baseless litigation or by asserting wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in
law and fact, in violation of counsel's ethical obligations. Therefore, we hold that
statements made prior to the commencement of an anticipated litigation are
privileged, and that the privilege is lost where a defendant proves that the
statements were not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation.
Id. (emphasis supplied).
Accordingly, the only question is whether the January 2015 statement Mr. Barden caused
to be issued to the six to thirty journalists was "pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation."
The undisputed evidence establishes that the answer is yes. Mr. Barden anticipated litigation."
He "fully complied with [his] ethical obligation as a lawyer." He was hardly "bullyling],
harass[ing], or intimidating]" the six to thirty journalists, since he caused a press agent, Mr.
"See Doc.542-7, Ex. K 9| 28 ("At the time I directed the issuance of the statement, I was
contemplating litigation against the press-recipients...."); id. 9 17 (statement was intended as
"a shot across the bow"", "the statement was very much intended as a cease and desist letter to
the media-recipients, letting [them] understand the seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell
considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false allegations and the legal indefensibility
of their own conduct"); Doc.542-6, Ex.F ("Maxwell ... reserves her right to seek redress").

Gow, to issue the statement," and he believed he had an affirmative duty in representing
Ms. Maxwell to prepare the statement and cause it to be delivered to the journalists. 2°
Plaintiff argues that when Mr. Barden issued the January 2015 statement on
Ms. Maxwell's behalf, he had only "wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact,
in violation of counsel's ethical obligations'" and did not have "good faith anticipated
litigation." Resp. 46 (quoting Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19; italics omitted). Plaintiff's rationale?
Because she was telling the truth and so the media would only be reporting the truth. Id. That is a
nonsensical, frivolous argument.
Whether Mr. Barden, who represents Ms. Maxwell, had a meritorious or good faith basis
for anticipating defamation litigation has nothing to do with whether the media believed plaintiff
was telling the truth, and surely not whether the plaintiff believed or said she was telling the
truth. Based on his knowledge of plaintiff's history, Mr. Barden in good faith believed that
plaintiff had been making false allegations for years and that the falsity of the allegations "should
have been obvious to the media." Doc.542-7, Ex.K 9| 13; see id. 99l 14, 16-17, 20-23, 26-28, 30.
Accordingly, at the time he caused the statement to issue, Mr. Barden had a good-faith basis to
anticipate litigation against any of the media that republished plaintiff's false allegations.
It hardly matters for purposes of the pre-litigation privilege whether the media
republished or did not republish plaintiff's allegations or whether Mr. Barden ultimately did or
did not sue any of the media for any republication. As the Khalil court recognized, "[a]ttorneys
often send cease and desist letters to avoid litigation," 28 N.E.3d at 19, and such letters have a
19The Khalil court admonished attorneys to "exercise caution when corresponding with
unrepresented potential parties who may be particularly susceptible to harassment and
unequipped to respond properly even to appropriate communications from an attorney." Khalil,

valid purpose protected by the pre-litigation privilege. Mr. Barden testified that the January 2015
statement in fact served as a cease and desist letter. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K 1| 17.
IV. Ms. Maxwell's January 4, 2015, statement is nonactionable.
Plaintiff did not respond to our argument that Ms. Maxwell's January 4, 2015, statement
to a reporter is nonactionable. See Memo. of Law 38-39. We respectfully submit plaintiff has
confessed this point. See Cowan, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 645-46.
V. Summary judgment is warranted because plaintiff cannot establish falsity or actual
malice by clear and convincing evidence.
Plaintiff is a public figure. See Memo. of Law 16-17, 49-54. Therefore, she must prove
falsity and actual malice. Under New York law, a public-figure defamation plaintiff must go
beyond the federal constitutional minimum and prove falsity by clear and convincing evidence.
Blair v. Inside Ed. Prods., 7 F. Supp. 3d 348, 358 & n.6 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing DiBella v.
Hopkins, 403 F.3d 102, 111 (2d Cir.2005)). She must also prove actual malice by clear and
convincing evidence. Karedes v. Ackerley Grp., Inc., 423 F.3d 107, 114 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting
Phila. Newspapers v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 773 (1986)).
Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that "produces in the mind of the trier of fact a
firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so
clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable the factfinder to come to a clear conviction,
without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue." Blair, 7 F. Supp. 3d. at 358 (internal
quotations and brackets omitted).
Plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence (a) the material falsity of three
sentences in the context of the January 2015 statement, and (b) Ms. Maxwell's actual malice, i.e.,
knowledge of the falsity of the three sentences or reckless disregard of whether they were false.
The three sentences are: in the first paragraph of the statement, plaintiff's allegations are
25


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page31 of 37
"untrue"; in the same paragraph, the "original allegations" have been "shown to be untrue"; and
in the third paragraph, plaintiff's "claims are obvious lies."?! Doc.1 9 30.
Plaintiff cannot prove the falsity of the three sentences, let alone actual malice. If the
Rule 56 record establishes that two of plaintiff's CVRA joinder-motion allegations are false and
two of her "original" allegations are false, this defamation action collapses on itself. This is
because the statement does not specify how many of plaintiff's allegations are false; it certainly
does not say "all" plaintiff' s allegations are false. It uses the plural of "allegation." The plural of
allegation literally means "more than one." See Memo. of Law 21.
Sentence No. 1. Since the sentence does not specify any particular allegation and since
plaintiff made a plethora of allegations against Ms. Maxwell, plaintiff would be required to prove
the truth of every one of the plethora of allegations and that Ms. Maxwell knew each one of the
allegations was true. Conversely, if there are at least two allegations that plaintiff cannot prove to
be true or if there was good reason for Ms. Maxwell to believe at least two of the allegations to
be false, then summary judgment should enter against plaintiff.
There are at least two allegations by plaintiff against Ms. Maxwell that are untrue. In the
CVRA joinder motion, plaintiff alleged that in plaintiff's first encounter with Mr. Epstein,
Ms. Maxwell took her to Mr. Epstein's bedroom for a massage that Mr. Epstein and
Ms. Maxwell "turned ... into a sexual encounter," Doc.542-4, Ex.D, at 3. This allegation
contradicted her allegation in the Sharon Churcher article that a woman other than Ms. Maxwell
''Ms. Maxwell said in her deposition she "know[s]" plaintiff is a "liar." This testimony,
plaintiff argues, "contradicts]" our contention that the three sentences in the January 2015
statement are opinion. Resp. 39-40. Plaintiff's argument is a non-sequitur. Ms. Maxwell's 2016
deposition testimony in which she disclosed all the reasons she believes plaintiff has uttered a
plethora of false allegations is wholly irrelevant to whether the three sentences in the January
2015 statement, prepared by Mr. Barden to respond to the joint-motion allegations, are opinions.
26


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page32 of 37
took her to Mr. Epstein's bedroom; during the massage that woman gave instructions to plaintiff,
and the massage "quickly developed into a sexual encounter." Doc.542-1, Ex.A, at 4.
A second allegation pertaining to plaintiff's entire story about Ms. Maxwell's
introduction of plaintiff to Prince Andrew is untrue. In the joinder motion, plaintiff alleged
Ms. Maxwell served an "important... role" in "Epstein's sexual abuse ring," namely,
connecting Mr. Epstein to "powerful individuals" who would sexually abuse plaintiff. Id., Ex.D,
at 5. Plaintiff alleged that in this role Ms. Maxwell introduced plaintiff to Prince Andrew, and
she was "forced to have sexual relations with this Prince in three separate geographical
locations," including Ms. Maxwell's London apartment. Id., Ex.D, at 5. These allegations
directly contradicted her earlier allegations in the 2011 Churcher article that (a) there never was
"any sexual contact between [plaintiff] and [Prince] Andrew," and (b) Prince Andrew did not
know "Epstein paid her to have sex with [Epstein's] friends." Id., Ex.A, at 6.
Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell said in the first sentence that plaintiff's
"allegations" —plural—against Ms. Maxwell are "untrue." We have just established through
plaintiff's own contradictory words that it would be fair to characterize at least two of her
allegations to be untrue. Having spent significant time with Ms. Churcher in 2011 and having
substantial incentive to disclose all important details of her "sex abuse" story, see Menninger
Decl. ExHIBIT OO, plaintiff in 2011 presented a story that exculpated Ms. Maxwell and Prince
Andrew of the very misconduct that in 2015-
—after securing a lawyer and seeing her story as a
profit vehicle she inculpated them for. In the face of her contradictory allegations, plaintiff
cannot possibly prove by clear and convincing evidence that all her joinder-motion allegations
are true, or that when Ms. Maxwell said they were untrue, she knew each one of the allegations
was true or that she recklessly disregarded whether each one was true.
27


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page33 of 37
Under New York law, a defendant's allegedly defamatory statement is held "to a standard
of substantial, not literal, accuracy." Law Firm of Daniel P. Foster, 844 F.2d at 959. Here,
Ms. Maxwell's first sentence literally is true: more than one of plaintiff's allegations are
"untrue." Accordingly, there is no defamation.
Sentence No. 2. The second sentence at issue in this action states, "The original
allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue." Plaintiff
alleges the sentence is defamatory to the extent it asserts the original allegations were "shown to
be untrue." Doc. 1 9 30. Plaintiff cannot prove this statement's falsity.
It is a matter of pure opinion whether any given allegation was "shown" to be untrue.
Some people require more proof than others to conclude that a fact has been "shown to be
untrue." We discussed above various examples of this, e.g., climate change. Here, Ms. Maxwell
via Mr. Barden in March 2011 issued a statement denying plaintiff's Churcher-story allegations
as "all entirely false." Doc.542-3, Ex.C. Plaintiff did not respond to this statement, let alone
claim it was defamatory. Her non-response reasonably could be seen as a concession that
Ms. Maxwell's denial was righteous. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K (Mr. Barden: "I would have been
remiss if I had sat back and not issued a denial, and the press had published that Ms. Maxwell
had not responded to enquiries and had not denied the new allegations; the public might have
taken the silence as an admission there was some truth in the in allegations.").
Regardless, we easily can show two of plaintiff's original allegations are untrue. Many of
plaintiff's original allegations are contained in the two Churcher articles, Docs.542-1 & 542-2,
Exs.A & B. The articles contained numerous allegations by plaintiff relating to her alleged
sexual abuse. In her deposition, plaintiff was shown Deposition Exhibit 7, a collection of some of
her allegations in the articles. Plaintiff placed checkmarks by those allegations she admitted-
over the course of 20 pages of testimony—were not true. See Menninger Decl. EXHIBIT PP, at
28


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page34 of 37
435:7-455:6 & Depo. Ex.7. These include her claims that: (1) she was 17 when she flew to the
Caribbean with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell "went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter,"
referring to former President Bill Clinton; (2) her conversation with Mr. Clinton about
Ms. Maxwell's pilot skills; and (3) Donald Trump was a "good friend" of Mr. Epstein's and
"flirted with me".
Plaintiff's admissions on the falsity of her original allegations are fatal to her defamation
claim as to the second sentence. The eleven admittedly false "original allegations" axiomatically
would warrant the second sentence. Plaintiff has no possible way to prove the second sentence is
false. Indeed, like Ms. Maxwell's first sentence, the second sentence literally is true: more than
one of plaintiff's original allegations are untrue. A statement that literally is true cannot be
defamatory as a matter of law. See Law Firm of Daniel P. Foster, 844 F.2d at 959.
Sentence No. 3. Defamation as to the third sentence is foreclosed. To begin with, as
discussed above, whether plaintiff has uttered "obvious lies" is a matter of opinion: in the face of
plaintiff's gratuitous and lurid allegations of Ms. Maxwell's years-long participation at the center
of a child sex-trafficking ring, for the journalists-recipients of the July 2015 statement the phrase
was an anticipated "epithet[], fiery rhetoric or hyperbole," Steinhilber, 501 N.E.2d at 556
(internal quotations omitted); see Tel. Sys. Int'l, 2003 WL 22232908, at *2 (observing Court's
previous holding in Rizzuto that defendants' use of phrases "conned," "rip off" and "lying" in
advertisements were not actionable as libel and were "rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet
used by those who considered themselves unfairly treated and sought to bring what they alleged
were the true facts to the readers") (internal quotations omitted).
Even if arguendo the third sentence—plaintiff's "claims are obvious lies"-cannot be
considered opinion, the Rule 56 record forecloses a defamation claim. The sentence does not
specify which of plaintiff's "claims," i.e., allegations, are obvious lies. It could refer to the
29


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page35 of 37
"original" claims; the "new," CVRA claims; the claims against Ms. Maxwell; the claims against
anyone, including Professor Dershowitz, who was mentioned in the preceding sentence; or any
two or more of all the claims plaintiff ever had made about her alleged experiences as the alleged
victim of a child sex-trafficking ring.
Regardless of what is being referred to, there is no defamation. As demonstrated in the
discussion above of the first and second sentences, the Rule 56 record establishes that at least
two of plaintiff's "original" allegations are untrue, at least two of her CVRA allegations are
untrue, at least two of her allegations against Ms. Maxwell are untrue, at least two of her
allegations against anyone (e.g., Ms. Maxwell, Prince Andrew or Professor Dershowitz) are
untrue, and at least two of her allegations about her alleged sex-trafficking experiences are
untrue. Moreover, the untruthfulness the falsity of the allegations certainly is "obvious."
After all, plaintiff herself admitted under oath that a multitude of her original allegations are
untrue, and she implicitly admitted some of her CVRA allegations are untrue because they were
contradicted by her original allegations.
CONCLUSION
The Court should grant summary judgment in favor of Ms. Maxwell.

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page9 of 74
I.
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
There can be no question that disputed issues of material facts preclude granting
summary judgment when, in a one-count defamation case, Defendant presents the Court with a
68-page memorandum of law, a 16-page statement of purported facts, and approximately 700
pages of exhibits. The sheer scope of Defendant's response, if anything, conclusively
demonstrates that volumes of disputed facts surround the core question of whether Defendant
abused Ms. Giuffre. Indeed, Defendant acknowledges a dispute between the parties as to whether
she abused Ms. Giuffre. See, e.g., Motion for Summary Judgment at 1; Motion to Dismiss at 1.
This Court already said that this disputed factual question is central to this case:
Either Plaintiff is telling the truth about her story and Defendant's involvement, or
defendant is telling the truth and she was not involved in the trafficking and
ultimate abuse of Plaintiff. The answer depends on facts. Defendant's statements
are therefore actionable as defamation. Whether they ultimately prove to meet the
standards of defamation (including but not limited to falsity) is a matter for the
fact-finder.
Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss at 10. While this fact remains in dispute,
summary judgment is foreclosed.
But even turning to Defendant's claims, the avalanche of aspersions she casts upon Ms.
Giuffre and her counsel should not distract the Court from the fact that the instant motion cannot
come within sight of meeting the standard for an award of summary judgment. The most glaring
and emblematic example of the Defendant's far-fetched claims appears in her attempt to move
away from her defamatory statement by arguing that it was her attorney and not her, who issued
the defamatory statement for the press to publish, though she is forced to admit the statement
was made on her behalf. This is an untenable position to take at trial, and an impossible
argument to advance at the summary judgment stage, as both the testamentary and documentary
evidence positively refute that argument. Defendant incorrectly asks this Court to make a factual
1


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page10 of 74
finding that her defamatory press release was actually a legal opinion, issued not by her, but by
her lawyer, to the media, despite documentary evidence showing otherwise.
Defendant also argues that she has proven the truth of her statement calling Ms. Giuffre a
liar with respect to the statements Ms. Giuffre made about Defendant. To the contrary,
voluminous evidence, both documentary and testimonial from numerous witnesses, corroborate
Ms. Giuffre's account of Defendant's involvement in the sexual abuse and trafficking of Ms.
Giuffre. Just to briefly highlight a few, Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her
under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for
Epstein, and punished her when she didn't cause Epstein to orgasm. Tony Figueroa testified that
Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that
Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre. Even more
shockingly, the butler for Defendant's close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old
Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with
Epstein and she refused. This is a fraction of the testimony that will be elicited at trial about
Defendant's involvement in the sexual abuse and trafficking of Ms. Giuffre.
Defendant's primary argument in support of her contention that she did not abuse and
traffic Ms. Giuffre as a minor child is that employment records show that Ms. Giuffre was either
sixteen or seventeen when Defendant recruited her from her job at Mar-a-Lago for sex with
Epstein, not fifteen-years-old as Plaintiff originally thought. Call this the "yes-I'm-a-sex-
trafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls" defense. Defendant does not explain why sexual
abuse of a fifteen year old differs in any material way from sexual abuse of a sixteen or
seventeen year old. All instances involve a minor child, who cannot consent, and who is
'See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 8:5-10; 13:1-3; 12:17-14:3; 15:1-5; 32:9-16; 34:5-35:1;
36:2-1.
2


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page11 of 74
protected by federal and state laws. The fact remains that Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre while
she was a minor child for sexual purposes and then proceeded to take her all over the world on
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, the "Lolita Express,"' as well as to his various
residences, and even to her own London house. Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that
Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre - although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even
a single one of those flights. Inconsequential details that Ms. Giuffre may have originally
remembered incorrectly do not render her substantive claims of abuse by Defendant false, much
less deliberate "lies." At most, these minor inaccuracies, in the context of a child suffering from
a troubled childhood and sexual abuse, create nothing more than a fact question on whether
Defendant's statement that Ms. Giuffre lied when she accused Defendant of abuse is
"substantially true," thereby precluding summary judgment. See Mitre Sports Int'l Ltd. v. Home
Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 255 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) ("Because determining whether COI
is substantially true would require this court to decide disputed facts ... summary judgment is not
appropriate").
Defendant has tried to spin these inconsequential mistakes of memory into talismanic
significance and evidence of some form of bad-faith litigation, but this claim fails under the
weight of the evidence. As the Court knows, the clear weight of the evidence establishes
Defendant's heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring and
in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms.
Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein - including 23
documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly

together. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 103:4-9 ("Q. After that day, do you
recall that she started coming to the house more frequently. A. Yes, she did. Q. In fact, did she
start coming to the house approximately three times a week? A. Yes, probably."). It is also
undisputed that witnesses deposed in this case have testified about Defendant's role as a procurer
of underage girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. At the very least, a trier of fact should
determine whether the evidence establishes whether or not Ms. Giuffre's claims of Defendant
being involved in her trafficking and abuse are true. Defendant's summary judgment motion
should be denied in its entirety.
Il.
UNDISPUTED FACTS
The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting
underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come
over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers. Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a
minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein's private jets - the - Lolita Express" - with Defendant at
least 23 times.
A.
It is an Undisputed Fact That Multiple Witnesses Deposed in This Case Have
Testified That Defendant Operated as Convicted Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's
Procurer of Underage Girls.
1.
It is an undisputed fact that Joanna Sioberg testified Defendant lured
her from her school to have sex with Epstein under the guise of hiring
her for a job answering phones.
Ms. Sjoberg's account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with
Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg's
school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein's home under the guise of a
legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student,
4


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page13 of 74
nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and
made it clear that Sjoberg's purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so
that Defendant did not have to do it.
Q. And when did you first meet Ms. Maxwell?
A. 2001. March probably. End of February/beginning of March.
Q. And how did you meet her?
A. She approached me while I was on campus at Palm Beach Atlantic College.
Q. And how long did you work in that position answering phones and doing -
A. Just that one day.
***
Q. And what happened that second time you came to the house?
A. At that point, I met Emmy Taylor, and she took me up to Jeffrey's bathroom and he was
present. And her and I both massaged Jeffrey. She was showing me how to massage. And
then she -- he took -- he got off the table, she got on the table. She took off her clothes, got
on the table, and then he was showing me moves that he liked. And then I took my clothes
off. They asked me to get on the table so I could feel it. Then they both massaged me.
Q. Who did Emmy work for?
2 A. Ghislaine.
3 Q. Did Maxwell ever refer to Emmy by any particular term?
5 A. She called her her slave.
***
Q. Did Jeffrey ever tell you why he received so many massages from so many different girls?
A. He explained to me that, in his opinion, he needed to have three orgasms a day. It was
biological, like eating.
***
Q. Was there anything you were supposed to do in order to get the camera?
THE WITNESS: I did not know that there were expectations of me to get the camera until
after. She [Defendant] had purchased the camera for me, and I was over there giving Jeffrey
a massage. I did not know that she was in possession of the camera until later. She told me --
called me after I had left and said, I have the camera for you, but you cannot receive it yet
because you came here and didn't finish your job and I had to finish it for you.
Q. And did you - what did you understand her to mean?
A. She was implying that I did not get Jeffrey off, and so she had to do it.
Q. And when you say "get Jeffrey off," do you mean bring him to orgasm?
A. Yes.
***
Q. Based on what you knew, did Maxwell know that the type of massages Jeffrey was getting
typically involved sexual acts?
THE WITNESS: Yes.
Q. What was Maxwell's main job with respect to Jeffrey?
5


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page14 of 74
THE WITNESS: Well, beyond companionship, her job, as it related to me, was to find
other girls that would perform massages for him and herself?
Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and
Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein's Manhattan mansion:
Q. Tell me how it came to be that there was a picture taken.
THE WITNESS: I just remember someone suggesting a photo, and they told us to go get on
the couch. And so Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet, the puppet
on her lap. And so then I sat on Andrew's lap, and I believe on my own volition, and they
took the puppet's hands and put it on Virginia's breast, and so Andrew put his on mine.*
Ms. Sjoberg's testimony corroborates Ms. Giuffre's account of how Defendant recruited
her (and others) under a ruse of a legitimate job in order to bring them into the household to have
sex with Epstein. Ms. Sjoberg's testimony also corroborates Ms. Giuffre's account of being lent
out to Prince Andrew by Defendant, as even the interaction Ms. Sjoberg witnessed included a
sexual act: Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre's breast while using a hand to
touch Ms. Sjoberg's breast.
It is an undisputed fact that Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant
would call him to bring over underage girls and that Defendant and
Epstein would have threesomes with Ms. Giuffre.
Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with
Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons:
Q. Okay. And tell me everything that you remember about what Ms. Roberts said about
being intimate with Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein at the same time.
A. I remember her talking about, like, strap-ons and stuff like that. But, I mean, like I said,
all the details are not really that clear. But I remember her talking about, like, how
they
would always be using and stuff like that.
Q. She and Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein would use strap-ons?
A. Uh-huh (affirmative).
***
3 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 8:5-10; 13:1-3; 12:17-14:3; 15:1-5; 32:9-16; 34:5-35:1;
36:2-15.
4 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 82:23-83:9.
5 Defendant attempts to discredit Figueroa's damaging testimony by repeatedly mentioning that he has been
convicted for a drug-related offense. Unsurprisingly, in this attack, Defendant does not mention that she has a DUI
conviction. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. at 390:13-15. (April 22, 2016).
6


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page15 of 74
Q. Other than sex with the Prince, is there anyone else that Jeffrey wanted Ms. Roberts to
have sex with that she relayed to you?
A. Mainly, like I said, just Ms. Maxwell and all the other girls.
Q. Ms. Maxwell wanted -- Jeffrey wanted Virginia to have sex with Ms. Maxwell?
A. And him, yeah.
Q. And did she tell you whether she had ever done that?
A. Yeah. She said that she did.
***
Q. And what did she describe having happened?
À. I believe I already told you that. With the strap-ons and dildos and everything."
Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for
Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein:
Q. [W]hen Ghislaine Maxwell would call you during the time that you were living with
Virginia, she would ask you what, specifically?
A. Just if I had found any other girls just to bring to Jeffrey.
Q. Okay.
A. Pretty much every time there was a conversation with any of them, it was either asking
Virginia where she was at, or asking her to get girls, or asking me to get girls.
Q. Okay. Well, tell me. When did Ms. Maxwell ask you to bring a girl?
A. Never in person. It was, like, literally, like, on the phone maybe, like, once or twice.
Q All right. Did Ms. Maxwell call you frequently?
A. No.
Q. All right. How many times do you think Ms. Maxwell called you, at all?
A. I'd just say that probably a just a few, a couple of times. Maybe once or twice.
Q. One or two --
A. The majority of the time it was pretty much his assistant.
Q. How do you know Ms. Maxwell's voice?
A. Because she sounds British.
Q. So someone with a British accent called you once or twice and asked for --
A. Well, she told me who she was.
Q. Okay. And what did she say when she called you and asked you to bring girls?
A. She just said, "Hi. This is Ghislaine. Jeffrey was wondering if you had anybody that could
come over."

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page16 of 74
It is an undisputed fact that Rinaldo Rizzo testified that Defendant
took the passport of a 15-year-old Swedish girl and threatened her
when she refused to have sex with Epstein.
Rinaldo Rizzo was the house manager for one of Defendant's close friends, Eva Dubin.
Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears - how, while working at Dubin's house, he observed
Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin's house. In distress, the 15 year old girl
tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through
threats and stealing her passport:
Q. How old was this girl?
A. 15 years old.
***
Q. Describe for me what the girl looked like, including her demeanor and anything else you
remember about her when she walks into the kitchen.
A. Very attractive, beautiful young girl. Makeup, very put together, casual dress. But she
seemed to be upset, maybe distraught, and she was shaking, and as she sat down, she sat
down and sat in the stool exactly the way the girls that I mentioned to you sat at Jeffrey's
house, with no expression and with their head down. But we could tell that she was very
nervous.
Q. What do you mean by distraught and shaking, what do you mean by that?
A. Shaking, I mean literally quivering.
***
Q. What did she say?
A. She proceeds to tell my wife and I that, and this is not -- this is blurting out, not a
conversation like I'm having a casual conversation. That quickly, I was on an island, I was
on the island and there was Ghislaine, there was Sarah, she said they asked me for sex, I said
no. And she is just rambling, and I'm like what, and she said -- I asked her, I said what? And
she says yes, I was on the island, I don't know how I got from the island to here. Last
afternoon or in the afternoon I was on the island and now I'm here. And I said do you have a
-- this is not making any sense to me, and I said this is nuts, do you have a passport, do you
have a phone? And she says no, and she says Ghislaine took my passport. And I said what,
and she says Sarah took her passport and her phone and gave it to Ghislaine Maxwell, and at
that point she said that she was threatened. And I said threatened, she says yes, I was
threatened by Ghislaine not to discuss this. And I'm just shocked. So the conversation, and
she is just rambling on and on, again, like I said, how she got here, she doesn't know how she
got here. Again, I asked her, did you contact your parents and she says no. At that point, she
says I'm not supposed to talk about this. I said, but I said: How did you get here. I don't
understand. We were totally lost for words. And she said that before she got there, she was
threatened again by Jeffrey and Ghislaine not to talk about what I had mentioned earlier,
about -- again, the word she used was sex.
Q. And during this time that you're saying she is rambling, is her demeanor continues to be
what you described it?
8


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page17 of 74
A. Yes.
Q. Was she in fear?
A. Yes.
Q. You could tell?
A. Yes.
A. She was shaking uncontrollably?
4.
It is an undisputed fact that Lyn Miller testified that she believed
Defendant became Ms. Giuffre's "new mama".
Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre's mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living
with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre's "new momma."'° Incredulously, Defendant
testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre."
It is an undisputed Fact that Detective Joseph Recarey testified that
he sought to investigate Defendant in relation to his investigation of
Jeffrey Epstein.
Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police's investigation of Epstein. He testified that
Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his
investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein's lawyer:
Q. A cross-reference of Jeffrey Epstein's residence revealed which affiliated names?
A. It revealed Nadia Marcinkova, Ghislane Maxwell, Mark Epstein. Also, the cross-
reference, any previous reports from the residence as well.
Q. During your investigation, did you learn of any involvement that Nadia Marcinkova had
with any of the activities you were investigating?
***
Q. The other name that is on here as a cross-reference is Ghislane Maxwell. Did you speak
with Ghislane Maxwell?
A. I did not.
Q. Did you ever attempt to speak with Ghislane Maxwell?
A. I wanted to speak with everyone related to this home, including Ms. Maxwell. My contact
was through Gus, Attorney Gus Fronstin, at the time, who initially had told me that he would
make everyone available for an interview. And subsequent conversations later, no one was
available for interview and everybody had an attorney, and I was not going to be able to
speak with them.
Q. Okay. During your investigation, what did you learn in terms of Ghislane Maxwell's
involvement, if any?

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page18 of 74
THE WITNESS: Ms. Maxwell, during her research, was found to be Epstein's long-time
friend. During the interviews, Ms. Maxwell was involved in seeking girls to perform
massages and work at Epstein's home.
It is an undisputed fact that Pilot David Rodgers testified that he flew
Defendant and Ms. Giuffre at least 23 times on Epstein's jet, the
"Lolita Express" and that "GM" on the flight logs Stands for
Ghislaine Maxwell.
Notably, at Defendant's deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms.
Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein's pilot's flight logs. ' However, David Rodgers,
Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials - GM - was,
in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant
flew with Plaintiff. '4 The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on
many of them when she flew with Defendant.!
7.
It is an undisputed fact that Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, and
Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about
Defendant trafficking girls for Jeffery Epstein.
Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years.
They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant's participation in
recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein. Marcinkova testified as follows:
Q. Did Ghislaine Maxwell work as a recruiter of young girls for Jeffrey Epstein when
you met her?
A. Same answer. [Invocation of Fifth Amendment]
***
Q. Have you observed Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein convert what started as
a massage with these young girls into something sexual?
A. Same answer. 16

Kellen testified as follows:
Q. Did Ghislaine Maxwell work as a recruiter for young girls for Jeffrey Epstein when you
met her?
A. On advice of my counsel I must invoke my Fifth and Sixth Amendment privilege...
***
Q. Isn't it true that Ghislaine Maxwell would recruit underage girls for sex and sex acts with
Jeffrey Epstein?
A. On advice of my counsel I must invoke my Fifth and Sixth Amendment privilege...!
Similarly, Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant's
involvement in procuring underage girls for sex with him.
Q. Maxwell was one of the main women whom you used to procure underage girls for sexual
activities, true?
THE WITNESS: Fifth.
***
Q. Maxwell was a primary co-conspirator in your sexual abuse scheme, true?
THE WITNESS: Fifth.
Q. Maxwell was a primary co-conspirator in your sex trafficking scheme, true?
THE WITNESS: Fifth.
Q. Maxwell herself regularly participated in your sexual exploitation of minors, true?
THE WITNESS: Fifth.!
8.
It is an undisputed fact that Juan Alessi testified that Defendant was
one of the people who procured some of the over 100 girls he
witnessed visit Epstein, and that he had to clean Defendant's sex toys.
Juan Alessi was Epstein's house manager. He testified as follows:
Q. And over the course of that 10-year period of time while Ms. Maxwell was at the house,
do you have an approximation as to the number of different females - females that you were
told were massage therapists that came to house?
A. I cannot give you a number, but I would say probably over 100 in my stay there.
Q. I don't think I asked the right - the question that I was looking to ask, so let me go back.
Did you go out looking for the girls -
A. No.
Q. - to bring -
A. Never
Q. - as the massage therapists?
A. Never.
Q. Who did?
" See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 8, Kellen Dep. Tr. at 15:13-18; 20:12-16.
18 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 3, Epstein Dep. Tr. at 116:10-15; 117:18-118:10.
11


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page20 of 74
A. Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Epstein and their friends, because their friend relay to other friends
they knew a massage therapist and they would send to the house. So it was referrals.
Q. Did you have occasion to clean up after the massages?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And that is after both a massage for Jeffrey Epstein, as well as clean up after a
massage that Ghislaine Maxwell may have received?
A. Yes.
Q. And on occasion, after -- in cleaning up after a massage of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine
A. yes, I did you have occasion to find vibrators or sex toys that would be left out?
It is an undisputed fact that Defendant was unable to garner a single
witness throughout discovery who can testify that she did not act as
the procurer of underage girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein.
Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one - to testify that
Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex. Even one of her
own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex.
Another one of Defendant's witnesses, Ms. Giuffre's mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre's
"new mamma." Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in
Epstein's shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have
testified that she was Epstein's procuress. Others who lived with her - Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia
Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen - invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on
the same. No one has testified to the contrary.
B.
Documentary Evidence also Shows that Defendant Trafficked Ms. Giuffre
and Procured her for Sex with Convicted Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein while
She Was Underage.
The Flight Logs
Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why
she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6
international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile's private jet all over the world. Her motion for

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page21 of 74
summary judgment - as well as all previous briefing papers - are absolutely silent on those
damning documents.
The Photographs
Throughout a mountain of briefing and, and even in her own deposition testimony,
Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre's photographs of her, Defendant,
and Epstein. She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed
with his hand around Ms. Giuffre's bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with
Defendant, inside Defendant's house in London. This particular photograph corroborates Ms.
Giuffre's claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be
in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now-
convicted sex offender 2°
Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with
Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein:21
20 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007167, Prince Andrew and Defendant Photo.
21 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 42, GIUFFRE007182 - 007166.
13


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page22 of 74
And, Ms. Giuffre has produced a number of pictures of herself taken at the Zorro Ranch,
Epstein's New Mexico Ranch, two of which are below.
22
Finally, among other nude photos, which included full nudes of Defendant, Ms. Giuffre
produced images of females that the Palm Beach Police confiscated during the execution of the

warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be pre-
pubescent (Ms. Giuffre will only submit its redacted form): 23
The Victim Identification Letter
In 2008, the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District of Florida identified
Ms. Giuffre as a protected "victim" of Jeffrey Epstein's sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms.
Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.24
Re:

IDENTIRIED VICTIM
NOTIFICATION OF
Dear
By virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District
of Florida provides you with the following notice hecause you are an identified victim of a
federal offense.
New York Presbyterian Hospital Records
Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical
records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre
produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page24 of 74
Defendant and Epstein taking Plaintiff to New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York while
she was a minor? The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old.
Judith Lightfoot Psychological Records
As the Court is aware, Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production
concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre's medical history. Defendant repeatedly and
vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records in a
fanfare of unnecessary motion practice. See, e.g., Defendant's Motion to Compel (DE 75);
Defendant's Motion for Sanctions at 10 ("Ms. Maxwell has been severely prejudiced by
Plaintiff's failure to provide the required identifying information and documents from her health
care providers."). Ms. Giuffre and her counsel took on the considerable burden and significant
expense of retrieving and producing over 250 pages of medical records from over 20 providers,
spanning two continents and nearly two decades.
Now that those records have been collected, Defendant's 68 page motion makes no
reference to a single medical record produced by Ms. Giuffre, nor a single provider, nor a single
treatment, nor or a single medication prescribed. After Defendant's repeated motion practice
stressing the essentiality of these records, this may surprise the Court. But not Ms. Giuffre.
Defendant's requests unearthed documents that are highly unfavorable to Defendant that
corroborate Ms. Giuffre's claims against her.
Years before this cause of action arose, Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a
psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and
Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist,
unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre's abuser:
25 See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 33, GIUFFRE003259-003290.
16


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page25 of 74
... [Ms. Giuffre] was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell who said she could help
her get a job as a massage therapist... seemed respectable... was shown how to
massage, etc., Geoff [sic] Epstein. Told to undress and perform sexual acts on
person. Miss Maxwell promised her $200 a job.?
Therefore, years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating
psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein.
6.
Message Pads
Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his
associates' sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff,
including Defendant, at Epstein's Palm Beach residence.? These were collected both from trash
pulls from the residence and during the execution of the search warrant where the pads were
found laying out in the open in the residence? The search warrant was executed in 2005 and the
message pads collected include messages recorded in 2004 and 2005. Numerous witnesses have
described that these copies of collected messages accurately reflect those taken by various staff
at the Palm Beach Epstein mansion between 2004 and 2005.29
The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell's involvement in the sexual abuse of
minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell's denial of any involvement with Epstein during
relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events.
While there were hundreds of these messages recovered during the investigation, this
small sample demonstrates the undeniable reality that there exists a genuine issue of material fact
with respect to Defendant's involvement in and knowledge of the activities described by Giuffre
which Maxwell has said we "untrue" and "obvious lies."
26 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 38, Lightfoot Records, GIUFFRE005437.

17


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page26 of 74
This sampling reveals that Maxwell, "GM," took messages at the residence, including
from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein. This
demonstrates that Maxwell was at Epstein's Palm Beach mansion in 2004 and 2005, incidentally
a time period she has denied being around the house in her deposition. See supra
GIUFFRE001412; 001435; 001449. The messages also reveal that multiple "girls" were leaving
messages that were being taken and memorialized and left out in the open for anyone to see.
Certain messages also make clear that a number of these "girls" were in school. In addition to
taking messages herself (and the staff working under her direction taking these relevant
messages), staff employees were taking and leaving messages for Defendant. This is evidence
that Maxwell was in the house at relevant times, including times that she has now testified under
oath that she was not there. Other messages demonstrate Epstein and Maxwell's friends,
including Jean Luc Brunel, leaving messages relating to underage females. The following is a
small sampling of such messages:

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74
The following are descriptions of a sampling of messages pads that create a genuine dispute
of material fact:
• One message pad reflects
, who is identified in the Palm Beach Police
Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for "work" explaining that she does not
have any money. The term "work" was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein's
sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages. (See GIUFFRE05660 ("She stated she
was called by Sara for her to return to work for Epstein.
stated 'work' is the term
to frarah to provide heavake i meden do, have money. Do yoy th no year
"I need work. I mean I don't have money. Do you have some
work for me?"
• Other message pads reflect
who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at
the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The
second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled
every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the
home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the
lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at
least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as
Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or
aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe.
Giuffre 001428 - undated Jeffrey From
- "Has girl for tonight" ; Giuffre
001432 (pictured above) 7/9/04 - Mr. Epstein From
is available
on Tuesday no one for tomorrow"; GIUFFRE 001433 /1/17/04 - Mr. Epstein from
- "Me and
can come tomorrow any time or
alone"; Giuffre -
001452 - undated Jeffrey from
"Has girl for tonight."
• Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young
females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis.
Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)- JE from "N" - "
hasn't confirmed
for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping
on hold in case
doesn't call back;
Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from
confirmed at 4 pm. Who is
scheduled for morning? I believe
wants to work."
This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year
old Russian girl for purposes of sex. Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For
Jeffrey From Jean Luc "He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak
Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your
1st today if you call."
• This message pad directly refutes Maxwell's sworn testimony that she was not present
during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach mansion because this shows
leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out
30 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28.

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74
with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a
fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered,

in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For
example, the message from "Larry" demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach

leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house. Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 - Mr.
Epstein from Ms. Maxwell - "tell him to call me"; Giuffre - 001449 - 8/22/05 - JE

There were other individuals that had called during that day.
Q. And when you would -- when you would see females' names and telephone numbers,
would you take those telephone numbers and match it to -- to a person?

It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal
friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant.
Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed
a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI. This document reflects the
numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers. Additionally,
and importantly, there are several sections entitled "Massage" alongside a geographical
designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers
included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy) - including

This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre's account of being sexually
exploited by Defendant and Epstein - not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm
Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in
2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence
contradicts that testimony.
Thailand Folder with Defendant's Phone Number
Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein
had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch. Defendant told Virginia
she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and
Defendant. Indeed, on the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote
on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to
check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words "Call Ms. Maxwell
(917)
!" on Virginia's travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard
copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit

It is undisputed fact that the FBI report and the Churcher emails

that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.

Additionally, 2011 correspondence with Sharon Churcher shows that Ms. Giuffre
disclosed her sexual encounters with Prince Andrew, but Churcher had to check with the
publisher's lawyers "on how much can be published,"
-----Original Message----
From: Sharon.Churcher@mailonsunday.co.uk
Sent: Friday, 18 February 2011 7:25 AM

Hi there
lave been up all night writing. Won't have an opinion from our lawyer ol
how much can be published until London wakes up. The lawyers wanted
internal FBI documents but I think the Justice Dept letter is all you have
from the feds??? Anyway can I give you a call early afternoon? Maybe have a
late lunch?
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 34, GIUFFRE003678. Accordingly, there is documentary
evidence that refutes Defendant's meritless argument that Ms. Giuffre did not allege she had sex
with Prince Andrew until 2014. To the contrary, two sources, including the FBI, show Ms.
Giuffre made these claims in 2011.
C.
Defendant Has Produced No Documents Whatsoever That Tend to Show
That She Did Not Procure Underage Girls For Jeffrey Epstein.
Defendant has produced no documents that even tend to show that she did not procure
underage girls for sex with Epstein, and no documents that tend to show that she did not
participate in the abuse. Indeed, Defendant refused to produce any documents dated prior to
2009, which includes the 2000-2002 period during which she abused Ms. Giuffre.
Against this backdrop of an avalanche of evidence showing the Defendant sexually
trafficked Ms. Giuffre, summary judgment on any of the issues advanced by Defen dant is
inappropriate. While we discuss the particulars of the individual claims below, the larger picture
is important too. Ms. Giuffre will prove at trial that Epstein and Defendant sexually trafficked
her. And yet, when Ms. Giuffre had the courage to come forward and expose what Defendant
had done to world - in a Court pleading trying to hold Epstein accountable - Defendant
26


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page35 of 74
responded by calling her a liar in a press release intended for worldwide publication. Such
heinous conduct is not a mere "opinion," but rather is defamation executed deliberately and with
actual malice. The jury should hear all of the evidence and then render its verdict on Ms.
Giuffre's complaint.
III. LEGAL STANDARD
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a motion for summary
judgment may be granted only when "there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." The Second Circuit has repeatedly
held that "all ambiguities and inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts should be
resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine
issue for trial should be resolved against the moving party." Swan Brewery Co. Ltd. v. U.S. Trust
Co. of New York, 832 F. Supp. 714, 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (Sweet, J.), citing Brady v. Town of
Colchester, 863 F.2d 205, 210 (2d Cir. 1988) (internal quotations omitted). In other words, in
deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must construe the evidence in the light most
favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-moving party's
favor. In re "Agent Orange" Prod. Liab. Litig., 517 F.3d 76, 87 (2d Cir. 2008). Stern v. Cosby,
645 F. Supp. 2d 258, 269 (S.D.N.Y.2009). Summary judgment should be denied "if the evidence
is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict" in favor of the non-moving party. See Net
Jets Aviation, Inc. v. LHC Comme'ns, LLC, 537 F.3d 168, 178-79 (2d Cir. 2008).
IV.
LEGAL ARGUMENT
A.
Defendant is Liable for the Publication of the Defamatory Statement and
Damages for Its Publication
Defendant's lead argument is that, when she issued a press release attacking Ms. Giuffre
to members of the media, she somehow is not responsible when the media quickly published her
27


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page36 of 74
attacks. If accepted, this remarkable claim would eviscerate defamation law, as it would permit a
defamer to send defamatory statements to the media and then stand back and watch - immune
from liability - when (as in this case) the defamatory statements are published around the world.
This absurd position is not the law, particularly given that the Defendant released a statement to
media asking them to "[p]lease find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell."
To make her claim seem plausible, Defendant cites older cases, some dating back as far
as 1906. This presents a distorted picture of the case law on these issues. As a leading authority
on defamation explains with regard to liability for republication by another of statement by a
defendant: "Two standards have evolved. The older one is that the person making the defamatory
statement is liable for republication only if it occurs with his or her express or implied
authorization of consent. The more modern formulation adds responsibility for all republication
that can reasonably be anticipated or that is the 'natural and probable consequence' of the
publication." SACK ON DEFAMATION § 2.7.2 at 2-113 to 2-114 (4th ed. 2016). In this case,
however, the nuances of the applicable legal standards make little difference because Defendant
so clearly authorized - indeed, desired and did everything possible to obtain - publication of her
defamatory statements attacking Ms. Giuffre.
1.
Under New York Law, Defendant is liable for the media's publication
of her press release.
Given the obvious purposes of defamation law, New York law unsurprisingly assigns
liability to individuals for the media's publication of press releases. Indeed, New York appellate
courts have repeatedly held that an individual is liable for the media publishing that individual's
defamatory press release. See Levy v. Smith, 18 N.Y.S.3d 438, 439, 132 A.D.3sd 961, 962-63
(N.Y.A.D. 2 Dept. 2015) ("Generally, [o]ne who makes a defamatory statement is not
responsible for its recommunication without his authority or request by another over whom he
28


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page37 of 74
has no control... Here, however ... the appellant intended and authorized the republication of
the allegedly defamatory content of the press releases in the news articles"); National Puerto
Rican Day Parade, Inc. v. Casa Publications, Inc., 914 N.Y.S.2d 120, 123, 79 A.D.3d 592, 595
(N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept. 2010) (affirming the refusal to dismiss defamation counts against a defendant
who "submitted an open letter that was published in [a] newspaper, and that [the defendant] paid
to have the open letter published," and finding that the defendant "authorized [the newspaper] to
recommunicate his statements.") See also RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF ToRTs § 576 (1977) ("The
publication of a libel or slander is a legal cause of any special harm resulting from its repetition
by a third person if ... the repetition was authorized or intended by the original defamer, or ...
the repetition was reasonably to be expected." 34
Defendant deliberately sent her defamatory statement to major news media publishers for
worldwide circulation because Defendant wanted the public at large to believe that Ms. Giuffre
was lying about her abuse. Defendant even hired a public relations media specialist to ensure the
media would publish her statement. Her efforts succeeded: her public relations agent instructed
dozens of media outlets to publish her "quotable" defamatory statement and they did.
Despite this deliberate campaign to widely publicize her defamatory statement,
Defendant now disclaims any responsibility for the media publishing her press release. If we
understand Defendant's position correctly, because she somehow lacked "control" over what
major newspapers and other media finally put in their stories, she escapes liability for
defamation. This nonsensical position would let a defamer send a false and defamatory letter to
major media, and then, when they published the accusation, escape any liability. Such an
34Cf., Eliah v. Ucatan Corp., 433 F. Supp. 309, 312-13 (W.D.N.Y. 1977) ("The alleged multistate publication of
laintiff's photograph without her consent thus gives rise to a single cause of action.... However, evidence of th
nultistate publication of the magazine and the number of copies sold would be competent and pertinent to
showing of damages, if any, suffered by plaintiff.")
29


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page38 of 74
argument is not only an affront to logic, but it is contrary to prevailing New York case law, cited
above. Perhaps even more important, in the context of the pending summary judgment motion, it
would require Defendant to convince the jury that she did not "authorize or intend" for the major
media to publish her press release. Obviously the disputed facts on this point are legion, and
summary judgment is accordingly inappropriate.
Even the cases Defendant cites contradict her argument. She first cites Geraci v. Probst,
in which a defendant sent a letter to the Board of Fire Commissioners, and, years later, a
newspaper published the letter. The court held that the defendant was not liable for that belated
publication, "made years later without his knowledge or participation." Id., at 340. By contrast,
Defendant not only authorized the defamatory statement, but paid money to her publicist to
convince media outlets to publish it promptly - actions taken with both her knowledge and
consent. Defendant's statement was thus not published "without [her] authority or request," as in
Geraci, but by her express authority and by her express request. Defendant's publicist's
testimony and the documents produced by Defendant's publicist unambiguously establish that
the media published her press release with Defendant's authority and by her request:
Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell's retention of your
services?
A. Yes, I was
***
Q. The subject line does have "FW" which to me indicates it's a forward. Do you know
where the rest of this email chain is?
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by Ms.
Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action. I
therefore respond, "Okay, Ghislaine, I'll go with this."
It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the second
one is "Urgent, this is the statement" so I take that as an instruction to send it out, as a
positive command: "This is the statement."35
35 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 44:6-45:13 (emphasis added).
30


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page39 of 74
Similarly, another case cited by Defendant, Davis v. Costa-Gavras, involved a libel claim
against a book author who wrote an account of the 1972 military coup in Chile. Years later, the
plaintiff attempted to ascribe defamation liability to a third-party publishing house's decision to
republish the book in paperback form and a third-party filmmaker who released a movie based
on the book. The Court held that a "party who is 'innocent of all complicity' in the publication of
a libel cannot be held accountable ... [but that] a deliberate decision to republish or active
participation in implementing the republication resurrects the liability." 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1094
(S.D.N.Y. 1984). Here, Defendant made a deliberate decision to publish her press release, and
actively participated in that process. At the very least, the jury must make a determination of
whether Defendant was "innocent of all complicity" for a libelous statement contained in her
press release.
Finally, Defendant cites Karaduman v. Newsday, Inc., 416 N.E.2d 557 (1980), which
held that reporters of a series of articles on narcotics trade "cannot be held personally liable for
injuries arising from its subsequent republication in book form absent a showing that they
approved or participated in some other manner in the activities of the third-party republisher."
Id., 416 N.E.2d at 559-560. Again, the jury could reasonably find that Defendant both approved
of, and even participated in, the media's publication of her press release. Indeed, it is hard to
understand how any jury could find anything else. Defendant was obviously "active" in
influencing the media to publish her defamatory press release, she both "approved" of and
pushed for the publication of the press release. Accordingly, she is liable for its publication. 36
36 On page 14 of her motion, Defendant makes wholly contradictory statements. In back-to-back sentences, she tells
the Court that (1) she has no control over whether the media published the statement she sent to the media (with
instructions to publish it by an influential publicist); (2) her public relations representative gave instructions to the
media on how to publish it (in full); and (3) her public relations representative "made no effort to control" how the
media would publish it. Indeed, the best evidence of Defendant's control over the press is the fact dozens of media
outlets obeyed her directive to publish her defamatory statement.
31


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page40 of 74
Therefore, disclaiming responsibility for the media's publication of a statement (for which she
hired a publicist for the purpose of influencing the media to publish that statement) is contrary to
both prevailing case law, and the cases cited by Defendant.
Defendant is liable for the media's publication of the defamatory
statement.
After arguing, contrary to New York law, that she is not liable for the media's publication
of her own press release, Defendant next argues that she is not liable for the media's publications
of the defamatory statement contained within her press release if the media chose to make even
the tiniest of editorial changes. If we understand Defendant's argument correctly, any omission
of any language from a press release is somehow a "selective, partial" publication for which she
escapes liability. Mot. at 14. Once again, this claim is absurd on its face. It would mean that a
defamer could send to the media a long attack on a victim with one irrelevant sentence and, when
the media quite predictably cut that sentence, escape liability for the attack. Moreover, even on
its face, the claim presents a jury question of what changes would be, in context, viewed as
"selective" or "partial" publications - something that only a jury could determine after hearing
all of the evidence.
In support of this meritless argument, Defendant cites Rand v. New York Times Co., for
the proposition that a defendant cannot be liable for a publisher's "editing and excerpting of her
statement." 430 N.Y.S.2d 271, 274, 75 A.D.2d 417, 422 (N.Y.A.D. 1980). This argument fails
for several reasons. First, there is no "republication" by the media as a matter of law. Defendant
issued a defamatory statement to the press, and its publication (as Defendant intended) is not a
"republication" under the law, as discussed above. Second, there was no "editing" or
paraphrasing or taking the quote out of context of the core defamatory statement in the press
release: that Ms. Giuffre is a liar. The "obvious lies" passage is the heart of the message
32


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page41 of 74
Defendant sent to the press: that Ms. Giuffre was lying about her past sexual abuse. Even in
isolation, Defendant's quote stating that Ms. Giuffre's claims are "obvious lies" does not distort
or misrepresent the message Defendant intended to convey to the public that Ms. Giuffre was
lying about her claims. As this Court explained in denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, this
case "involves statements that explicitly claim the sexual assault allegations are false." Giuffre v.
Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d 147, 152 (S.D.N. Y. 2016).
Furthermore, the facts at issue here make the Rand holding inapposite. In Rand, a
newspaper paraphrased and "sanitized" defendant's words. No such changing, sanitizing, or
paraphrasing occurred in the instant case: the media quoted Defendant's statement accurately.
Further, the phrase at issue in Rand was that certain people "screwed" another person. The
speaker/newspaper used the term "screwed" in reference to a record label's dealings with a
performing artist, and not did not mean "screwed" in the literal sense, but as "rhetorical
hyperbole, and as such, is not to be taken literally." Id. By contrast, there is no hyperbole in
Defendant's defamatory statement, and it was never distorted or paraphrased by any publication
known to Ms. Giuffre. A jury could reasonable conclude that Defendant's statement that Ms.
Giuffre's claims of child sexual abuse are "obvious lies" is not a rhetorical device, nor
hyperbole, but a literal and particular affirmation that Ms. Giuffre lied.
Accordingly, there is no support in the factual record that the media reporting that
Defendant stated that Ms. Giuffre's claims of childhood sexual abuse are "obvious lies" is a
distortion of Defendant's message or hyperbole. Even a cursory review of the press release
would lead to that conclusion. Moreover, to the extent that there is any dispute that Defendant's
statement had a different meaning outside of the context of the remainder of the press release,
33


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page42 of 74
such a determination of meaning and interpretation is a question of fact for the jury to decide,
and is inappropriate for a determination upon summary judgment.
B.
Material Issues of Fact Preclude Summary Judgment.
1.
The Barden Declaration presents disputed issues of fact.
The primary basis of Defendant's motion for summary judgment is her attorney's self-
serving, post hoc affidavit wherein he sets forth his alleged "intent" with regard Defendant's
defamatory statement.3? Ms. Giuffre disputes Defendant's attorney's alleged and unproven
"intent" (not to mention Defendant's "intent"), not only because Defendant refuses to turn over
her attorney's communications, but also because questions of intent are questions of fact to be
determined by a trier of fact. Furthermore, ample record evidence contradicts the claimed
"intent."
a.
The Barden Declaration is a deceptive back-door attempt to inject
Barden's advice without providing discovery of all attorney
communications.
In her brief, Defendant discloses her attorney's alleged legal strategy and alleged legal
advice; however, she deliberately states that her attorney "intended," instead of her attorney
"advised," when discussing her attorney's legal strategy and advice, using that phrase at least 37
times,38 and using phrases such as Barden's "beliefs,"39 "purposes, "40 "goals, '4' and
37 The Barden declaration is problematic for other reasons as well. In addition to Defendant's over-length, 68-page
motion and among Defendant's 654 pages of exhibits lies an eight-page attorney affidavit that proffers legal
conclusions and arguments. This exhibit is yet another improper attempt to circumvent this Court's rules on page
limits. See Pacenza v. IBM Corp., 363 F. App'x 128, 130 (2d Cir. 2010) (affirming lower court decision to strike
"documents submitted ... in support of his summary judgment motion [that] included legal conclusions and
arguments" because those "extraneous arguments constituted an attempt... to circumvent page-limit requirements
submitted to the court."); cf. HB v. Monroe Woodbury Cent. School Dist., 2012 WL 4477552, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept.
27, 2012) ("The device of incorporating an affirmation into a brief by reference, as Plaintiffs have done here, in
order to evade the twenty-five page limit, rather obviously defeats the purpose of the rule"). The court should
disregard the Barden Declaration for that reason alone

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page43 of 74
"contemplations" 25 other times. All the while Defendant has claimed a privilege as to her
communications with Barden. Defendant attempts to convince the Court that she only granted
Gow permission to publish the defamatory statement as part of "Mr. Barden's deliberated and
carefully crafted" (MSJ at 16) legal strategy and advice. Yet, she still refused to turn over her
communications with Barden under the auspices of attorney-client privilege. Such
gamesmanship should not be permitted.
If the Court were to consider the Barden Declaration (which it shouldn't), it would be
ruling on a less than complete record because, based on this Declaration, it is necessary that
Defendant disclose all communications with him and possibly others. Ms. Giuffre doesn't have
those communications, the court doesn't have those communications; therefore, Defendant is
asking for summary judgment on an incomplete record.
The Court should also not consider the Barden Declaration because it will be
inadmissible as unduly prejudicial. It is a self-serving declaration by a non-deposed witness
made without turning over the documents that are relevant to the declaration. See, e.g., Rubens v.
Mason, 387 F.3d 183, 185 (2d Cir. 2004) ("We find that the District Court predicated its grant of
summary judgment as to liability on an affidavit from the arbitrator who presided over the
underlying arbitration, the probative value of which was substantially outweighed by the danger
of unfair prejudice. The affidavit, therefore should not have been admitted. We therefore vacate
the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on liability and remand to the District Court.").
b.
Defendant's summary judgment argument requires factual findings
regarding Barden's intent, thereby precluding summary judgment.
Even were the Court to consider this Declaration and representations therein - which it
should not - the declaration itself demonstrates that the Court would have to make factual

42 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 22, Defendant's Privilege Log.
35


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page44 of 74
finding as to what Mr. Barden's intent really was. Finding about intent are inappropriate at the
summary judgment stage, as this Court and the Second Circuit have recognized. This Court has
explained, "if it is necessary to resolve inferences regarding intent, summary judgment is not
appropriate." Id. (Sweet, J.) (emphasis added), citing Patrick v. Le Fevre, 745 F.2d 153, 159 (2d
Cir. 1984); Friedman v. Meyers, 482 F.2d 435, 439 (2d Cir. 1973) (other citations omitted).
C.
There are factual disputes regarding Barden's Declaration.
Finally, there are material disputes over the statements in the Barden Declaration because
they are directly refuted by record evidence. For example, the instant motion and the Barden
Declaration describe the press release merely as a document expressing "his [Mr. Bardent's]
opinion - in the form of a legal argument -as a lawyer would be," as opposed to a press release
for dissemination by the media to the public. Record evidence refutes this claim, as (1) the press
release was sent to journalists, not media publishers or in-house counsel; (2) the press release
instructed the journalists to publish the defamatory statement ("Please find attached a quotable
statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell"); (3) it was issued by a publicist on Defendant's behalf and
not by an attorney, without any reference to attorneys or laws - indeed, Gow testified that
Barden was unavailable to approve the statement; and (4) Gow testified that he issued the
statement only after he understood Defendant to have "signed off" it, an understanding he
formed based on Defendant's "positive command" to him: "This is the agreed statement."
Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell's retention of your
services?
A. Yes, I was.
***
Q. When you say "agreed statement" can you tell me more about what you mean? Who
agreed to the statement?
A. I need to give you some context, if I may, about that statement. So, this is on New Year's
Day. I was in France so the email time here of 21:46, in French time was 22:46, and I was
getting up early the next morning to drive my family back from the south of France to
England, which is a 14-hour journey, door to door. So on the morning of th° 2nd of January,
36


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page45 of 74
bearing in mind that Ms. Maxwell, I think was in New York then, she was five hours behind,
so there was quite a lot of, sort of time difference between the various countries here, I sent
her an email, I believe, saying - parsing this-- forwarding this email to her saying "How do
you wish to proceed?" And then I was on the telephone-- I had two telephones in the car, I
received in excess of 30 phone calls from various media outlets on th° 2nd of January, all
asking for information about how Ms. Maxwell was looking to respond to the latest court
filings, which were filed on the 30th of December as I understand.
And by close-- towards close of play on the 2nd, I received an email forwarded by
Ms. Maxwell, containing a draft statement which my understanding was the majority of
which had been drafted by Mr. Barden with a header along the lines of "This is the agreed
statement.". At close of play on th° 2nd. So-I was-I had gone under the Channel Tunnel and
I was sitting on the other side and that email, which my understanding was that it had been
signed off by the client, effectively, was then sent out to a number of media, including Mr.
Ball and various other UK newspapers.
Q. Mr. Gow, when you say "end of play" and "close of play," are you referring to sending
the email that is Exhibit 2?
A. Yes, 1 am
***
Q. The subject line does have "FW" which to me indicates it's a forward. Do you know
where the rest of this email chain is?
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by Ms.
Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action.
I therefore respond, "Okay, Ghislaine, I'll go with this."
It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the
second one is "Urgent, this is the statement" so I take that as an instruction to send it
out, as a positive command: "This is the statement. "43
Accordingly, record evidence shows that the press release was intended as press release,
and not as a "legal argument." Record evidence also establishes that Defendant circulated the
press release to Barden and Gow, and then gave a "positive command" to Gow to publish it.
Additionally, there is no indicia that the press release is a legal opinion. To the contrary, it was
issued by, and specifically attributed to, a woman who has personal knowledge of whether Ms.
Giuffre's claims of sexual abuse are true, and she states that Ms. Giuffre is a liar. 4 At the very
least, all of these factual issues must be considered by a jury.
43 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 31:19-33:7; 44:6-45:13 (emphasis added).
4 Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites no case law to support her argument that her attorney's alleged influence in
preparing the statement Defendant issued to the media somehow shields her from liability.
37


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page46 of 74
Another example is that Defendant states that "Gow served only as Mr. Barden's conduit
to the media" (MTD at 25), and "Mr. Barden was directing the January 2-15 statement to a
discrete number of media representatives." Barden wasn't directing anything - he wasn't even in
the loop when Defendant decided to publish the statement - and the documents prove it. Indeed,
the press release itself states that it is "on behalf of Ms. Maxwell," not Barden, and it was
Defendant who gave the "positive command" to Gow to publish it. These are just a couple of
examples, among many, of the purported facts asserted in Defendant's motion and Barden's
Declaration that are directly refuted by facts in the record.
Finally, neither the media nor the general public could have known that the statement
should be attributed to Barden. His name was nowhere in it, nor is there any reference to counsel.
Defendant's argument that the "context" is the media knowing Barden's intent or involvement is
unsupported by the record. The significant factual disputes about Barden, alone, prevent
summary judgment.
Defendant's Defamatory Statement Was Not Opinion as a Matter of Law.
As this Court previously held, correctly, Defendant stating that Ms. Giuffre's claims of
sexual assault are lies is not an expression of opinion:
"First, statements that Giuffre's claims 'against [Defendant] are untrue,' have
been 'shown to be untrue,' and are 'obvious lies' have a specific and readily
understood factual meaning: that Giuffre is not telling the truth about her history
of sexual abuse and Defendant's role, and that some verifiable investigation has
occurred and come to a definitive conclusion proving that fact. Second, these
statements (as they themselves allege), are capable of being proven true or false,
and therefore constitute actionable fact and not opinion. Third, in their full
context, while Defendant's statements have the effect of generally denying
Plaintiff's story, they also clearly constitute fact to the reader."
Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). This Court further explained:
"Plaintiff cannot be making claims shown to be untrue that are obvious lies
without being a liar. Furthermore, to suggest an individual is not telling the truth
38


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page47 of 74
about her history of having been sexually assaulted as a minor constitutes more
than a general denial, it alleges something deeply disturbing about the character of
an individual willing to be publicly dishonest about such a reprehensible crime.
Defendant's statements clearly imply that the denials are based on facts separate
and contradictory to those that Plaintiff has alleged." Id.
Defendant argues that somehow the "context" of the entire statement "tested against the
understanding of the average reader" should be the press release as a whole being read only by
journalists. This is an unreasonable construct because the ultimate audience for a press release is
the public. Indeed, the purpose of a press release is to reach readers. Unsurprisingly, Defendant
cites no case that holds that journalists might somehow believe statements of fact are opinion
while others do not.
This Court has previously covered this ground when it clearly stated:
Sexual assault of a minor is a clear-cut issue; either transgression occurred or it
did not. Either Maxwell was involved or she was not. The issue is not a matter of
opinion, and there cannot be differing understandings of the same facts that justify
diametrically opposed opinion as to whether Defendant was involved in Plaintiff's
abuse as Plaintiff has claimed. Either Plaintiff is telling the truth about her story
and Defendant's involvement, or Defendant is telling the truth and she was not
involved in the trafficking and ultimate abuse of Plaintiff.
Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp.at 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The same conclusion applies now. At
the motion to dismiss stage, Defendant had not yet produced the statement she issued to the
press. That statement is now in evidence, so there is no ambiguity as to what defendant released
to the press.
The absurdity of Defendant characterizing his statements calling Ms. Giuffre a liar as
mere "opinion" is revealed by the fact that Defendant was the one who was sexually trafficking
and otherwise abusing Ms. Giuffre. No reasonable person in any context would construe that as
Defendant's mere "opinion" on the subject, since Defendant knew she was abusing Ms. Giuffre.
Indeed, this argument is contradicted by Defendant's own deposition testimony:
39


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page48 of 74
Q. Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?
A. I can only testify to what I know. I know that Virginia is a liar and I know what
she testified is a lie. So I can only testify to what I know to be a falsehood and half
those falsehoods are enormous and so I can only categorically deny everything she
has said and that is the only thing I can talk about because I have no knowledge of
anything else.
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. (April 17, 2016) at 174:6-19.
Defendant slyly contends in her motion that "Mr. Barden's "arguments" in the press release
constitute 'pure opinion," attempting to disclaim any involvement in making the defamatory
statement. However, it is not Mr. Barden's statement, nor his opinion, that it at issue here. At
issue here is Defendant's statement - a statement attributable to her, that she approved, whose
publication she "command[ed]," and for which she hired a public relations representative to
disseminate to at least 30 journalists for publication. While Mr. Barden could possibly have had
his own opinion as to whether or not his client abused Ms. Giuffre, Defendant cannot express an
opinion on a binary, yes/no subject where she knows the truth. As this Court previously
articulated, "statements that Giuffre's claims 'against [defendant] are untrue,' have been 'shown
to be untrue,' and are 'obvious lies' have a specific and readily understood factual meaning."
Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 152. Again, at the very least, the jury must pass on such
issues.
The Pre-Litigation Privilege Does Not Apply to Defendant's Press Release
Defendant fails to make a showing that the pre-litigation privilege
applies.
Defendant's next argument seeks refuge in the pre-litigation privilege. If we understand the
argument correctly, Defendant seems to be saying that because she was contemplating an
(unspecified and never-filed) lawsuit involving the British Press, she somehow had a "green
light" to make whatever defamatory statements she wanted about Ms. Giuffre. To prove such a
40


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page49 of 74
remarkably claim, Defendant relies on caselaw involving such mundane topics as "cease and
desist" letters sent to opposing parties and the like. Obviously such arguments have no
application to the press release that Defendant sent out, worldwide, attacking Ms. Giuffre's
veracity.
The problems with the Defendant's argument are legion. For starters, there is no record
evidence - not even Defendant's own testimony - suggesting that she was contemplating
litigation against Ms. Giuffre, or that her press release was related to contemplated litigation
against Ms. Giuffre. Tellingly, the only "evidence" Defendant cites of any alleged contemplated
litigation is the self-serving, post hoc, partial waiver of attorney-client privilege found in the
Barden Declaration. As discussed above, that Declaration fails to establish that there was good
faith anticipated litigation between her and Ms. Giuffre, particularly when evidence in the record
contradicts such assertions. At the very least, it is a matter of fact for the jury to decide.
In another case in which a defendant attempted to claim pre-litigation privilege applied to
statements made to the press, this Court denied summary judgment, and held, "ItJo prevail on a
qualified privilege defense [defendant] must show that his claim of privilege does not raise
triable issues of fact that would defeat it." Block v. First Blood Associates, 691 F. Supp. 685,
699-700 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (denying summary judgment on the pre-litigation qualified
privilege affirmative defense because there was "a genuine issue as to malice and appropriate
purpose"). Defendant's claim here likewise fails.
First, Defendant's testimony makes no mention of any contemplated lawsuit - much less,
any contemplated lawsuit against Ms. Giuffre. Second, Defendant has offered no witnesses who
will testify that she intended to bring any law suit. Third, she did not, in fact, bring any such
lawsuit. The only "evidence" is a post hoc Declaration written by her attorney. Finally, it must be
41


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page50 of 74
remembered, as explained at length above, the Defendant had sexually trafficking Defendant and
was attempting to continue to conceal her criminal acts. Whether her statements had an
"appropriate purpose," Block 691 F. Supp. at 699-700 (Sweet, J.) - or were, rather, efforts by a
criminal organization to silence its victims - is obviously contested. Accordingly, obvious issues
of fact exist as to whether or not Defendant contemplated litigation.
Distorting reality, Defendant further argues: "Statements pertinent to a good faith
anticipated litigation made by attorneys (or their agents under their direction) before the
commencement of litigation are privileged." (MSJ at 33). The record evidence shows that
Defendant's attorney did not make the defamatory statement. Further, Defendant's attorney's
agents did not make the defamatory statement. Defendant did. And, there was no statement made
by anyone "before the commencement of litigation" because litigation never commenced.
Accordingly, the cases Defendant cites where attorneys are making statements (or where clients
are making statements to their attorneys regarding judicial proceedings including malpractice)
are wholly inapposite as detailed below. 45
45
• Front v. Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 720 (2015) - statement made by attorney
• Flomenhaft v. Finkelstein, 127 A.D.3d 634, 637 n.2, 8 N.Y.S.3d 161 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015) - did not ever
address pre-litigation privilege, and said that Front, Inc. was not relevant to the case.
• Kirk v. Heppt, 532 F. Supp. 2d 586, 593 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) - the communication at issue was made by an
attorney's client to the attorney's malpractice carrier concerning the client's justiciable controversy against the
attorney over which the clients actually sued.
• Petrus v Smith, 91 A.D.2d 1190 (N.Y.A.D.,1983) - the court held: "[r]emarks of attorney to Surrogate are
cloaked with absolute immunity as statements made in course of judicial proceedings - Attorney's gratuitous
opinion outside courthouse calling plaintiff liar ... is not similarly immune." (This case undermines the false
argument Defendant tries to make).
• Klien - contrary to dicta quoted by Defendant from the Klein case, there were no communications made
"between litigating parties or their attorneys," just a press release Defendant instructed her press agent to
disseminate to the media.
• Frechtman v. Gutterman, 115 A.D.3d 102, 103, 979 N.Y.S.2d 58, 61 (2014) - the communication at issue was a
letter sent by a client to his attorney terminating the representation for malpractice.
• Sexter & Warmflash, P.C. v. Margrabe, 38 A.D.3d 163 (N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept. 2007) - privilege applied to letter
client sent discharging law firm as the client's attorneys as statements relating to a judicial proceeding and law
firm sued for defamation.
42


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page51 of 74
Similarly, in Black v. Green Harbour Homeowners' Ass'n, Inc., 19 A.D.3d 962, 963, 798
N. Y.S.2d 753, 754 (2005), cited by Defendant, the Court held a privilege applied to a letter sent
by a home owner's association board of directors to the association's members informing them
of the status of litigation to which the association was a party, and to the association's letter to
the state attorney general sent to discharge it's duties to the association. In this case, litigation
was actually pending, the communication was sent by a party to that litigation as part of its
duties, and the communication itself concerned the litigation. Defendant's press release fits none
of those descriptions.
Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites to no case in which a Court has held that this or any
qualified privilege extends to internationally disseminated press releases defaming a non-party to
the purported "anticipated" litigation. Regardless of whether or not Barden had a hand in drafting
the statement (another disputed issue of fact for the jury, Defendant issued the statement,
instructed that it be published, and the statement she issued was attributed to her, and not to her
attorney (or his agents). Accordingly, all the case law Defendant cites about an attorney making
a statement (or a client making a statement to their attorney or malpractice carrier) is inapposite.
Defendant is foreclosed from using the pre-litigation privilege because
she acted with malice.
In any event, because Defendant acted with malice, she cannot avail herself of the pre-
litigation privilege. As this Court has explained denying Defendant's motion to dismiss, 'There
is no qualified privilege under New York law when such statements are spoken with malice,
knowledge of their falsity, or reckless disregard for their truth."" Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F.
Supp. 3d at 155 (citing Block, 691 F. Supp. at 699 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. 1988). There is ample
record evidence that Defendant acted with malice in issuing the press release, thereby making the
litigation privilege inapplicable. See Block, 691 F. Supp. at 700 (Sweet, J.) ("Here, sufficient
43


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page52 of 74
evidence has been adduced to support the inference that [defendant] acted with malice, and may
not, therefore, claim a qualified privilege under New York law ... a genuine issue as to malice
and appropriate purpose has properly been raised and is sufficient to preclude summary
judgment."). For example, Ms. Sjoberg testified that Defendant recruited her for sex with
Epstein, thus corroborating Ms. Giuffre's own account of Defendant's involvement in abusing
her with Epstein. For another example, Jeffrey Epstein's pilot testified that Defendant flew with
Ms. Giuffre on at least 23 flights, thus corroborating Ms. Giuffre's claims against Defendant. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 15, Rodgers Dep. Tr., at 34:3-10. For another example, Tony
Figueroa testified that Defendant asked him for assistance in recruiting girls for Epstein - more
testimony that corroborates Ms. Giuffre's claims against Defendant.
Defendant's statements that Ms. Giuffre was lying and her claims of sexual abuse were
"obvious lies" were not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation but, instead, they were
made for an inappropriate purpose - i.e., to bully, harass, intimidate, and ultimately silence Ms.
Giuffre. As the record evidence shows, Defendant knew the statements were false because
Defendant engaged in and facilitated the sexual abuse of this minor child, therefore, they were
made for the inappropriate purpose of "bullying," "harassment," and "intimidation." See Front v.
Khalil, 24 N. Y.3d 713, 720 (2015). Simply put, Defendant sexually trafficked Ms. Giuffre - and
then tried to silence Ms. Giuffre to keep her crimes secret - circumstances that prevent her from
using privileges designed to shield legitimate legal disputes from court interference.
New York case law fully confirms that pre-litigation qualified privilege does not apply to
this case. Historically, statements made in the course of litigation were entitled to privilege from
defamations claims "so that those discharging a public function may speak freely to zealously
represent their clients without fear of reprisal or financial hazard." Id. at 718. A 2015 New York
44


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page53 of 74
Court of Appeals case somewhat extended this privilege by holding that statements made by
attorneys prior to the commencement of the litigation are protected by a qualified privilege if
those statements are pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation. Id. at 718. ("Although it is
well settled that statements made in the course of litigation are entitled to absolute privilege, the
Court has not directly addressed whether statements made by an attorney on behalf of his or her
client in connection with prospective litigation are privileged"... "to advance the goals of
encouraging communication prior to the commencement of litigation" ... "we hold that
statements made prior to the commencement of an anticipated litigation are privileged, and that
the privilege is lost where a defendant proves that the statements were not pertinent to a good
faith anticipated litigation.").
The Court of Appeals' reason for allowing this qualified privilege could not be more
clear: "When litigation is anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to communicate in
order to reduce or avoid the need to actually commence litigation. Attorneys often send cease
and desist letters to avoid litigation. Applying privilege to such preliminary communication
encourages potential defendants to negotiate with potential plaintiffs in order to prevent costly
and time consuming judicial intervention." Id. at 719-20. Under this rationale, the Khalil court
found that an attorney's letters to the potential defendant were privileged because they were sent
"in an attempt to avoid litigation by requesting, among other things, that Khalil return the alleged
stolen proprietary information and cease and desist his use of that information." Id. at 720.
Here, quite unlike Khalil, the Defendant's statements were (1) made by a non-attorney
(Defendant through Gow); (2) concerning a non-party to any alleged anticipated litigation; (3)
knowingly false statements; and (4) contained in a press release directed at, and disseminated to,
45


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page54 of 74
the public at large. Defendant's statements cannot be considered "pertinent to a good faith
anticipated litigation," such that the qualified privilege should apply.
Finally, though it strains credulity to even entertain the prospect, if Defendant could
make even colorable showings on these basic issues, it would remain an issue of fact for the jury
to determine whether or not Defendant's press release, calling Ms. Giuffre's sex abuse claims
"obvious lies," was any type of "cease-and-desist" statement or a statement that acted to "reduce
or avoid" or resolve any "anticipated" litigation. Summary judgment is obviously inappropriate
here as well.
Defendant cannot invoke the pre-litigation privilege because she has
no "meritorious claim" for "good faith" litigation.
Finally, Defendant cannot prevail in asserting this qualified privilege because, in order to
invoke this privilege, she must have "meritorious claims" for "good faith anticipated litigation."
Khalil specifically states that for the qualified privilege to apply, the statements must be made
"pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation," and it does not protect attorneys... asserting
wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact, in violation of counsel's ethical
obligations." Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d at 718, 720 (emphasis added). Defendant has neither
"meritorious claims" nor "good faith anticipated litigation." Defendant cannot have a
"meritorious claim" for "good faith anticipated litigation" against the press (or Ms. Giuffre)
because Ms. Giuffre's reports of her sexual abuse are true, Defendant knows that they are true,
and Defendant made a knowingly false statement when she called Ms. Giuffre a liar. Under these
circumstances, Defendant has no "meritorious" claim to make in "good faith" relating to either
Ms. Giuffre's statements or their coverage in the press, thereby making her defamatory
statements wholly outside the protection of this qualified privilege. At the very least, the issue of
46


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page55 of 74
whether Defendant has meritorious claims against the press on the grounds that she did not abuse
Ms. Giuffre is a question of fact for the jury to decide.
V.
DEFENDANT HAS NOT - AND CANNOT - SHOW THAT HER DEFAMATORY
STATEMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE
Defendant next claims that her press release calling Ms. Giuffre a liar about her past sex
abuse was somehow "substantially true." Here again, this is a highly disputed claim. On its face,
to determine what is "substantially" true or not requires extensive fact finding, such as whether
Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre as a minor child for sex with Defendant's live-in boyfriend and
convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate. See
Mitre Sports Intern. Ltd. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 255 (S.D.N. Y.2014)
(denying summary judgment because it would require the Court to decide disputed facts to
determine whether the statement at issue was substantially true); Da Silva v. Time Inc., 908 F.
Supp. 184, 187 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (denying motion for summary judgment because there was a
genuine issue of material act as to whether defamatory photo and caption were not true, stating
"[i]n the instant case Da Silva's contention that she was a reformed prostitute at the time of
photography and publication provides a rational basis upon which a fact-finder could conclude
that the photograph was not substantially true").
Additionally, Defendant has remarkably not submitted any evidence that she did not
recruit Ms. Giuffre for sex with Epstein. Nor has Defendant offered any evidence that her role in
Epstein's household was not to recruit girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. Accordingly,
summary judgment is inappropriate. See Stern v. Cosby, 645 F. Supp. 2d 258, 277 (S.D.N.Y.
2009) (because defendant had "not submitted any evidence to show that Statement 11 is
substantially true, her motion for summary judgment as to Statement 11 is denied").
47


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page56 of 74
Further, much of the purported evidence upon which Defendant relies to allege the truth
of her defamatory statement is merely hearsay, including inadmissible hearsay statements made
by Alan Dershowitz, who Defendant did not depose in this case (and whom Ms. Giuffre has not
had an opportunity to cross examine). Hearsay cannot establish the truth of a defamatory
statement as a matter of law at summary judgment. Lopez v. Univision Communications, Inc., 45
F. Supp.2d 348, 359 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (denying summary judgment and holding "defendants'
evidence as to what they were told by representatives of NYU and Kean College, to the extent
offered for the truth of the matters asserted, is inadmissible hearsay and an insufficient basis
upon which to grant summary judgment of dismissal on the ground that the statements were
substantially true.").
Finally, many of the facts upon which Defendant bases her argument that her defamatory
statement was true are wholly tangential to the claims against her by Ms. Giuffre and the
defamatory statement. For example, Defendant supports her contention that she did not recruit
Ms. Giuffre for sex with Epstein based on the fact that Ms. Giuffre lived independently of her
parents before meeting Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. (Of course, a child outside the supervision of
her parents makes it much more likely she would be recruited by Defendant into sex trafficking,
but that is for the jury to decide.) That fact does not go to whether or not Defendant's statement
calling Ms. Giuffre a liar is true, because Ms. Giuffre never made any claims relating to where
she lived prior to meeting Defendant. Moreover, it is immaterial with whom she was living: the
fundamental and overarching fact remains that Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre for sex with
Epstein when she was a minor child.
Defendant next proffers Ms. Giuffre's limited high school enrollment and short-term jobs
that she held as evidence that she and Epstein did not abuse her. The logic of this position is
48


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page57 of 74
unclear. The fact that Ms. Giuffre worked at Taco Bell for a few days hardly establishes she was
not abused by Defendant and Epstein. Indeed, if anything its shows the vulnerability of Ms.
Giuffre to enticements that a billionaire and his wealthy and powerful girlfriend could offer. In
any event, what to make of such fact is something for the jury to consider. They are irrelevant for
the same reason as above: Ms. Giuffre never made any claims about her studies or her prior
employment. Indeed, neither Ms. Giuffre's statement about being recruited by Defendant as a
child, nor Defendant's refutation even mentions Ms. Giuffre's lack of schooling or lack of a
stable home as a child. Purported facts that have nothing to do with Ms. Giuffre's claims of
sexual abuse against Defendant, and nothing to do with Defendant calling Ms. Giuffre a liar for
such claims, do not establish the "substantial truth" of Defendant's statement. Tellingly,
Defendant cites to no analogous case in any jurisdiction that even suggests otherwise.
VI.
PLAINTIFF DOES NOT NEED TO ESTABLISH MALICE FOR HER
DEFAMATION CLAIM, BUT IN THE EVENT THE COURT RULES
OTHERWISE, THERE IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT RECORD EVIDENCE
FOR A REASONABLE JURY TO DETERMINE DEFENDANT ACTED WITH
ACTUAL MALICE
Defendant's next (and, again, quite remarkable) argument is that Ms. Giuffre somehow
will be unable to establish actual malice in this case. One would think that a sex trafficker calling
one of her victims a liar would be a quintessential example of actual malice. Defendant's
spurious case citations and misplaced argument do not detract from this core fact.
Though Defendant does not mention the legal standard for actual malice until she is 48
pages into her 68-page brief, the legal definition of actual malice, as defined by the United
46 Though perhaps a scrivener's error, Defendant errantly cites to two Supreme Court cases - Gerts v. Robert Welch,
a public election.
49


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page58 of 74
States Supreme Court, and reiterated by the Second Circuit, should be the light by which all of
Defendant's purported "facts" and argument should be viewed. "Actual malice" means that the
statement was published with "knowledge that the statement was "false or with reckless
disregard of whether it was false or not.'" Baiul v. Disson, 607 F. App'x 18, 20 (2d Cir. 2015),
quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 280, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686
(1964).
Defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre is a limited purpose public figure. While Ms. Giuffre
disputes that claim, the issue is entirely irrelevant here because Ms. Giuffre will prove at trial,
with overwhelming evidence, that Defendant made her statement calling Ms. Giuffre a liar with
malice, fully knowing - as a sex trafficker - that it was false. Put another way, Defendant knew
that Ms. Giuffre was telling the truth when she described how Defendant recruited her for sex as
an underage girl and then sexually trafficked her with her boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein.
The Second Circuit instructs that, "Lo]n a motion for summary judgment, a court cannot
try issues of fact; it can only determine whether there are issues to be tried. If, as to the issue on
which summary judgment is sought, there is any evidence in the record from any source from
which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, summary
judgment is improper." Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp.., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994)
(internal citations and quotations omitted). "As the moving party, Defendants have the burden of
demonstrating an absence of clear and convincing evidence substantiating Plaintiffs' claims." De
Sole v. Knoedler Gallery, LLC, 139 F. Supp. 3d 618, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Chambers).
Defendant fails to meet her burden of demonstrating an absence of clear and convincing
evidence substantiating Ms. Giuffre's claims that Defendant acted with actual malice. Ms.
Giuffre will easily be able to meet any trial burden of clear and convincing evidence of actual
50


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page59 of 74
malice. Tellingly, Defendant does not even attempt to address the documentary evidence, nor the
testimonial evidence showing she was a recruiter of girls for Epstein.
As shown above, far beyond showing that a reasonable inference could be drawn in her
favor, which is all that is required at this point to defeat Defendant's motion, Ms. Giuffre will
easily be able to meet her trial burden of clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.
Of course, a plaintiff need only show "actual malice" on the part of a defendant if that
plaintiff is a public figure or a limited public figure, which Ms. Giuffre is not, as explained infra.
VII. THE COURT NEED NOT REACH THE ISSUE, AT THIS TIME, OF WHETHER
MS. GIUFFRE IS A LIMITED PURPOSE PUBLIC FIGURE
For the reasons just explained, Ms. Giuffre will easily be able to prove actual malice at
the trial in this case. Defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre "is a public figure who must prove actual
malice." MSJ at 49. Given the overwhelming proof of the second part of that statement, the
Court need not spend its time considering the first.
If the Court wishes to nonetheless consider the issue at this time, it is not appropriate for
disposition at the summary judgment stage of this case. The defendant bears the burden of
demonstrating that the plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure. See Lerman v. Flynt Distrib.
Co., 745 F.2d 123, 136-37 (2d Cir. 1984). Defendant correctly articulates the legal test for a
finding that a plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure, but glosses over the fact that all prongs
of the test must be met in order for a court to make that finding. See, e.g., Contemporary
Mission, Inc. v. N.Y. Times Co., 842 F.2d 612, 617 (2d Cir. 1988) ("[T]his court set forth a four
part test for determining whether someone is a limited purpose public figure" (emphasis added));
Herbert v. Lando, 596 F. Supp. 1178, 1186 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) ("The Second Circuit recently
summarized the criteria" (emphasis added)), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 781 F.2d 298 (2d Cir.
1986); cf. Nehls v. Hillsdale Coll., 178 F. Supp. 2d 771, 778 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (finding plaintiff
51


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page60 of 74
was not a limited public figure for failing one element of the Lerman test and thus denying
defendant's motion for summary judgment) ("The defendant has proven all of the elements but
the third ..."), aff'd, 65 F. App'x 984 (6th Cir. 2003). Of course, proof that Ms. Giuffre (or
anyone else) is a limited purpose public figure requires proof of a set of facts from which Ms.
Giuffre believes Defendant has not shown in satisfaction of the four-part test.
Significantly -this Court should pause here to note that the details of Jane Doe 3's sexual
exploitation and abuse, as anonymously set forth in her CVRA joinder motion, caused the
Defendant to identify, with certainty, Jane Doe 3 as Ms. Giuffre. Yet, at her deposition,
Defendant claimed to "barely remember her at all."T Defendant's ability to immediately and
positively identify the anonymous individual making claims of sexual abuse, if anything, shows
that Defendant was intimately aware of Ms. Giuffre's sexual exploitation.
And, to be sure, Ms. Giuffre never asked to be sexually abused or trafficked by
Defendant or convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when she was a child - legally, she did not
even have the capacity to consent. Defendant cannot recruit a minor child for sexual exploitation
and then, afterwards, argue that her victim injected herself into the public controversy when
coming forward about the abuse she suffered.
Moreover, Defendant has not made a sufficient showing that Ms. Giuffre has "regular"
and "continuing" access to the news media. The policy rationale behind this prong is that public
figures generally enjoy significant access to the media. One reporter wrote some articles on Ms.
Giuffre in 2011. Thereafter, it was not until 2015, that Ms. Giuffre spoke to someone in the news
media about these issues, and that interview was granted after Defendant's defamatory remarks.
Such limited contacts precludes a finding that Ms. Giuffre is a limited public figure. See
47 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. at 44:23-45:4 (July 22, 2016) ("Q. You do remember
Virginia, about that time back in the 2000s, giving Mr. Epstein massages? A. I barely remember her at all.").
52


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page61 of 74
Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 99 S. Ct. 2675, 61 L.Ed.2d 411 (1979) (finding plaintiff
maintained no regular and continuing access to the media and thus was not a public figure.
It is also unclear how Defendant plans to show that Ms. Giuffre "successfully invited
public attention to her views." To be sure, Ms. Giuffre decided to start "Victims Refuse Silence,"
a not-for-profit organization whose mission is "to change the landscape of the war on sexual
abuse and human trafficking. Our goal is to undertake an instrumental role in helping survivors
break the silence associated with sexual abuse. To fulfill this mission, we aim to enhance the
lives of women who have been victimized."48 The website lists the National Trafficking Hotline,
and provides a state-by-state resources for local organizations where victims can seek help.
Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites no cases that hold that maintaining a website makes one a public
figure. See Mitre Sports Int'l Ltd. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 252 (S.D.N.Y.
2014) (finding plaintiff was not a limited public figure and denying defendant's motion for
summary judgment) ("corporate policy denouncing child labor on its website ... do[es] not show
that Mitre ... aimed to influence the public's views on the controversy"). More important,
Defendant does not explain how Ms. Giuffre was using the website to influence public views on
whether she had been abused by Defendant - the subject at issue in this lawsuit.
Interestingly, Defendant has spent $ 17,875"° on an expert witness to tell the Court and
the jury that hardly anyone searches on the internet using search terms such as "victims refuse
silence sex slave." One of Defendant's six briefs raising Daubert issues specifically argues that
Dr. Anderson's estimates on the cost of remediating Ms. Giuffre's online reputation are improper
because Dr. Anderson included nearly unused search phrases when evaluating internet content.
Kent's rebuttal report states: ".
... there seems no reason to believe that such a person would use
4http://www.victimsrefusesilence.org/our-mission.
49 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 9, Kent Dep. Tr. at 25:16-26:6.
53


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page62 of 74
this term... Indeed, these are terms unlikely to be used by anyone unfamiliar with this litigation.
... Why, for instance, would it be necessary to push down offending Web pages in the results
that the search engines provide for the term victim's refuse silence sex slave, when this term is
likely never used
...." See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 25, Kent Report at 10, 33.
Defendant cannot argue to the Court that Ms. Giuffre has "successfully" invited public
attention to her views through her VRS website while simultaneously filing a Daubert motion
that argues that search terms such as "victims refuse silence sex slave" are "likely never used,"
thus making the website unsuccessful in inviting public attention. In any event, Defendant has
failed to set forth with precision the allegedly undisputed fact - and supporting evidence - she
uses to support her argument.
Moreover, "lilt is preferable to reduce the public figure question to a more meaningful
context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular
controversy giving rise to the defamation." Greenberg v. CBS Inc., 69 A.D.2d 693, 704, 419
N.Y.S.2d 988, 995 (1979) (emphasis added), citing Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323,
345, 352, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789. The context here is highly significant. Ms. Giuffre
never chose to participate in Defendant and Epstein's underage sex ring, a "controversy" that
gave rise to Defendant's defamation. In arguing that Ms. Giuffre thrust herself into the public
spotlight, Defendant conveniently leaves out the fact that it is by her doing that Ms. Giuffre is in
this controversy in the first place. No minor child willingly becomes a participant in sexual
abuse, and it is perverse for the abuser to argue that her victim deliberately became a subject of
public attention when speaking out about that abuse for the purpose of advancing justice and
helping other victims.
54


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page63 of 74
For all these reasons, the Court should simply decline to decide the public figure issue at
this juncture. But if it chooses to reach the issue, it should reject Defendant's unsupported
argument.
VIII. THE JANUARY 2015 STATEMENT WAS NOT "SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE,"
AND MS. GIUFFRE HAS PRODUCED CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE
OF ITS FALSITY
As a final argument, Defendant argues that her January 2015 statement was "substantially
true." Given that the statement argues that Ms. Giuffre lied when she said she was sexually
trafficked by Defendant, the reader of Defendant's motion might reasonably expect to see some
evidence presented showing that Defendant was not a sex trafficker. Instead, the reader is treated
to technical quibbles. For example, the lead argument to show the "substantial" truth of
Defendant's statement is the argument that Ms. Giuffre was not fifteen years old, but all of
sixteen or seventeen years old when she was trafficked. As the Court knows (and can take
judicial notice of), Florida law makes age eighteen the age of consent. Accordingly, it is no
moment that Ms. Giuffre may have been mistaken about the exact year the sex trafficking
started. Call this the "yes-I'm-a-sex-trafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls" defense. To
even describe the defense is to show how meritless it is.
More broadly, at issue are the statements Ms. Giuffre made regarding Defendant's
involvement in, and knowledge of, the sexual abuse and sex trafficking of Ms. Giuffre (and other
minor girls) through a recruitment scheme executed by Defendant and Jeffrey Epstein. In
response to those various statements, Defendant publicly claimed that, "the allegations made by
(Ms. Giuffre) against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue." Defendant continued that Ms. Giuffre's
"claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such..." Defendant, through her statement
55


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page64 of 74
intended to convey that Ms. Giuffre was lying about everything she had said against Defendant -
"the allegations."
In sum and essence, those statements made by Ms. Giuffre about which Defendant
released a public statement to exclaim were "untrue" and "obvious lies" were:
(1) That Defendant approached Ms. Gluffre while Ms. Gluffre was an underage
minor working at the Mar-a-Lago Country Club, and recruited the then-minor
Ms. Giuffre to go to the house of Jeffrey Epstein under the pretense of providing
(2) That Ms. Giuffre followed Defendant's instructions, and was driven to Jeffrey
Epstein's house, where she was greeted by Defendant and later introduced to
Jeffrey Epstein;
(3) That Ms. Giuffre was lead upstairs to be introduced to Jeffrey Epstein in his
bedroom, and that while there Defendant demonstrated how Ms. Giuffre should
provide a massage to Jeffrey Epstein;
(4) That Defendant and Epstein converted the massage into a sexual experience,
requesting that Ms. Giuffre remove her clothing, after which time a sexual
encounter was had;
5)
That Defendant and Epstein expressed approval for Ms. Giuffre, and offered her
money in exchange for this erotic massage turned full sexual encounter;
(6) That Defendant and Epstein offered Ms. Giuffre the promise of money and a
better life in exchange for Ms. Giuffre acting sexually compliant and
subservient to their demands;
(7)
That Ms. Giuffre, after that first encounter, was repeatedly requested to service
Epstein and/or Defendant sexually and/or others;
(8) That Ms. Giuffre was taken on Epstein's private planes on numerous occasions
and trafficked nationally and internationally for the purpose of servicing Epstein
and others, including Defendant, sexually;
(9)
That Defendant was Epstein's primary manager of the recruitment and training
of females who Epstein paid for sexual purposes;
(10) That Defendant participated in sexual encounters with females, including Ms.
Giuffre; and
(11) That Ms. Giuffre and other recruited females were encouraged by Defendant
and Epstein to bring other young females to Epstein for the purpose of servicing
him sexually.
56


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page65 of 74
Defendant, by way of her January 2015 statement, declared that Ms. Giuffre lied about
each and every one of these allegations regarding Defendant. In fact, Defendant clarified further
this position in her deposition when she said repeatedly that everything Ms. Giuffre said about
Defendant was totally false. ° The clarification in her deposition is identical in intention to the
reasonable interpretation of her statement that Defendant made publicly, which has formed the
basis of this defamation action
- that Ms. Giuffre was lying about everything she said about
Defendant, and that Defendant was not at all involved in the activity she was accused of
engaging in.
While her public statement could not have been more clear, as her deposition testimony
further underscored, Defendant intended the world to believe that nothing Ms. Giuffre said about
Defendant was true, and that Defendant was not at all involved with any of the things she was
accused of, Defendant has decided in this motion to minutely dissect the nuance of Ms. Giuffre's
various statements to cause the Court to reach a far-fetched conclusion that Defendant's
insidiously false statement was somehow "substantially true." Ironically, this
repositioning amounts to nothing more than an admission by Defendant of the defamatory nature
of her statement.
A.
When Ms. Giuffre Initially Described Her Encounters With Defendant and
Year in, She Mistakenly Believed the First Encounter Occurred During the
Discovery has resulted in the production of records, including Ms. Giuffre's employment
records from Mar-a-Lago, which she did not possess at the time she was recounting her
interactions with Defendant. Those records establish that the initial encounter wherein Defendant
recruited Ms. Giuffre occurred during the year 2000 and not during 1999. Ms. Giuffre was
50 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 135:3-4; 178:15-178:24; 179:20-180:7; 228:7-
229:10.
57


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page66 of 74
sixteen years old before August 9, 2000, and turned seventeen on that date. It is unclear from the
limited records available whether Defendant approached and recruited Ms. Giuffre before or just
after Ms. Giuffre's 17th birthday. However, what has now been established through numerous
witnesses is that Defendant approached and recruited a minor child for the purposes of enticing
that minor over to the house of Jeffrey Epstein, a currently-registered sex offender.S' The exact
lure of Ms. Giuffre by Defendant - enticement of being paid money to give a billionaire a
massage at his mansion - was used by Epstein and his many associates and employees to recruit
dozens and dozens of other underage girls. There is no doubt that the crux of Ms. Giuffre's
statement on this point is that Defendant recruited her when she was only a minor child unable to
consent to sex, not precisely how far under the age of consent she was. Defendant's public claim
that Ms. Giuffre's account of this approach, and recruiting element, was "untrue" and "obvious
lies" is not "substantially true," but is itself an obvious lie - as Ms. Giuffre will prove to the jury
at trial.
B.
Defendant's January 2015 Statement Claiming as "Untrue" and an "Obvious
Lie" the Allegation That She Regularly Participated in Epstein's Sexual
Exploitation of Minors and That the Government Knows Such Fact is Not
Substantially True But Instead Completely False.
Defendant next argues that she "accurately denied that [she] regularly participate[d] in
Epstein's sexual exploitation on minors' and that 'the Government knows such fact." MSJ at 58.
It is not clear whether Defendant is nitpicking this statement by contesting whether she
"regularly" participated in Epstein's sexual exploitation or whether she did participate, but the
Government was unaware of the extent of her involvement. Call this the "yes-l'm-a-sex-
trafficker-but-only-on-Tuesdays-and-Thursdays" defense - here again, to simply recount the
claim is to see its absurdity.
S1 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, 5, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 94:24-95:2; Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21; 116:19-
117:12.
58


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page67 of 74
Contrary to Defendant's misleading, cherry-picked fragments of information she has
chosen to use to support her point, there is an abundance of evidence clearly linking Defendant
to Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors. As the Court is aware, numerous message pads were
recovered from Epstein's home indicating Defendant's involvement in and knowledge of
Epstein's illegal exploitation. ' Additionally, numerous employees and others have testified
about Defendant's high-ranking position in the hierarchal structure of the sexual exploitation
scheme. " In fact, multiple individuals, in addition to the Ms. Giuffre, have testified about
Maxwell's involvement in the exploitation of minors, including Ms. Giuffre. 4
Defendant also argues that one government investigator, Palm Beach, Florida, Detective
Recarey, may not have been aware of her involvement in the sex trafficking. Defendant fails to
cite another passage in Detective Recarey's deposition, where he noted that he was aware of
Defendant's involvement with Epstein and the sexual exploitation of children." But even
assuming Recarey was unaware (which Ms. Giuffre strongly disputes), Defendant would have, at
most, a "yes-I'm-a-sex-trafficker-but-I-successfully-hid-it-from-one-of-the-cops" defense -
again, not a likely claim.
More broadly, Ms. Giuffre's statement about what the "Government" knew about sex
trafficking was made in pleadings filed in a federal Court case attacking the decision of the U.S.
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida to offer Jeffrey Epstein immunity from
prosecution for federal sex trafficking crimes. Accordingly, to present an even arguable claim for
summary judgment, Defendant would have to show that the U.S. Attorney's Office (and its

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page68 of 74
investigators from the FBI) did not know about Defendant's sex trafficking. This proof would
need to include, for example, evidence that the FBI did not learn about Defendant's sex
trafficking when (among other things) Ms. Giuffre told FBI agents about it when she met with
them in Australia in 2011. Here again, Defendant has no evidence to even begin making such a
showing.
C.
Defendant's January 2015 Statement Claiming as "Untrue" or an "Obvious
Lie" That Maxwell and Epstein Converted Ms. Giuffre Into a Sexual Slave is
Not Substantially True.
Defendant next argues that she accurately disputed Ms. Giuffre's statement that
Defendant held her as a "sex slave." Relying on dictionary definitions of "slave" that define the
term to refer to a "confined" person who is the "legal property" of another (MSJ at 59, citing
Merriam-Webster, etc.), Defendant claims Ms. Giuffre was not confined or the property of
Defendant. Call this the "yes-l'm-a-sex-trafficker-but-I-didn't-use-chains" defense. And, once
again, to even describe the defense is to refute it.
Defendant does not explain why the jury would be required to use the held-in-chains
definition of "slave" in evaluating her statement. Merriam-Webster (11" ed. 2006) also defines
"slave" as "one that is completely subservient to a dominating influence" - a definition that fits
Ms. Giuffre's circumstances to a tee. As Ms. Giuffre has explained in detail, she was recruited as
a minor child by Defendant, who then dominated her and used for sexual purposes. That
testimony alone creates a genuine issue of fact on this point.
From the context of all of Ms. Giuffre's statements about Defendant, Ms. Giuffre has
never said or implied that she was physically placed in a cage. Instead, she has described the vast
disparity of power and the influence of Defendant and Epstein, the fear of disobedience, the
typical locations of the abuse being in a private plane, in huge mansion manned with Epstein

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page69 of 74
Defendant, in addition to the continued - and fraudulent - promise of a better future, as those
things that kept her retained in a situation of sexual servitude. While not physical chained, Ms.
Giuffre was groomed as minor and trained, and these factors became her invisible chains.
Indeed, as Ms. Giuffre's expert on sex trafficking, Professor Coonan, has explained:
Popular understandings of the term "sex slave" might still connote images of
violent pimps, white slavery, or of victims chained to a bed in a brothel in the
minds of some people. To call Ms. Giuffre a victim of sex trafficking would
however very accurately convey the reality that she along with a great many other
victims of contemporary forms of slavery are often exploited by the "invisible
chains" of fraud and psychological coercion.
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 23, Coonan Expert Report at 20.
If the Court takes as true, which it must for the purpose of this motion, that Ms. Giuffre
was trafficked and used exclusively for sexual purposes by Defendant and Epstein, then the
Court must also reach the conclusion at this stage that Maxwell's assertion - that Ms. Giuffre's
description of being a sex slave is "untrue" or "obvious lies" - is not substantially true. There
undoubtedly remains a genuine issue of material fact on this point, and in fact, Defendant's
position taken in this motion is tantamount to an admission of the truth of Plaintiff's statement
about Defendant on this point.
D.
Any Statement of Misdirection Regarding Professor Alan Dershowitz is
Nothing More Than an Irrelevant Distraction to The Facts of This Case and
Matters Not on the Defense of Whether Defendant's Statement Was
Substantially True.
Defendant next contends that she accurately recounted that Alan Dershowitz had denied
having sex with Ms. Giuffre. MSJ at 60. Call this the "yes-I'm-a-sex-trafficker-but-she-was-not-
trafficked-to-the-professor" defense. While it is accurate that Ms. Giuffre made allegations
against Professor Dershowitz, those allegations are not at issue in this case. Defendant, in her
defamatory statement, claimed that "the allegations made by [Ms. Giuffre] against Ghislaine
Maxwell are untrue." See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 26, GM_00068. In her deposition,


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page70 of 74
Defendant maintained the position that she "cannot speculate on what anybody else did or didn't
do." See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 180:3-180:4. In fact,
regarding Ms. Giuffre's claims about others, Defendant unequivocally stated, "I can only testify
to what she said about me, which was 1000 percent false." See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11,
Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 228:10-228:12.
Defendant Maxwell makes additional misstatements about Dershowitz's production in a
defamation action filed against him in her desperate attempt to have Dershowitz to jump aboard
and help bail out her sinking canoe. While Ms. Giuffre can - and, if necessary, will - refute
Dershowitz's claim he was not a beneficiary of Epstein and Defendant's sex trafficking, that is
not relevant at this stage. Whatever may or may not have happened with Dershowitz (and Ms.
Giuffre's sworn statements that he sexually abused her is alone enough to create disputed facts
on the issue of whether Defendant's statements about him were "substantially true") has no
bearing whatsoever on the truth or falsity of the statements Ms. Giuffre made about Defendant.
This case is not about whether Ms. Giuffre has ever made untruthful allegations against
anyone, which she contends she has not, but about whether her allegations about Defendant
were true, or whether those specific allegations were "untrue," "obvious lies" as Defendant
publicly proclaimed. These issues are disputed and must go to the jury.
E.
Contrary to Defendant's Position, There is a Genuine Issue of Material Fact
as to Whether She Created or Distributed Child Pornography, or Whether
the Government Was Aware of Same.
Defendant next argues that she did not create child pornography and that the Government
knew this. Call this the "until-you-find-the-photos-I'm-innocent" defense. Of course, as noted
earlier, Defendant's claim requires that she show that "the Government" - in context, the FBI
and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida - "knew" that she had no
62


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page71 of 74
child pornography. Yet Defendant has offered no such evidence - much less evidence so
powerful as to warrant summary judgment on this point.
This point is disputed from the simple fact that Ms. Giuffre herself testified that
Defendant took many photograph of her naked. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep.
Tr. at 232:3-9; 233:7-9. This is consistent with the Palm Beach butler's, Alfredo Rodriguez's,
testimony that he personally saw photos of naked children on Defendant's computer. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24. Another
housekeeper, Juan Alessi also saw photos of young nude females on Defendant's computer,
although he wasn't sure whether to consider it pornography. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1,
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 175:5-175:24. Finally, Detective Recarey found a collage of nude photos of
young females in Epstein's closet, and turned the photos over to the FBI and U.S. Attorney's
office." While the U.S. Attorney's office will not share the photos obtained from Recarey's
investigation, it is thus undisputed that the government possesses photos of nude, young females
confiscated from Epstein's Palm Beach mansion. Indeed, the police video disclosed through a
FOIA request shows naked images of women throughout the house, including a full nude of the
Defendant." At a minimum, there is a clear genuine issue of material fact in this regard.
Defendant Did Act as a "Madame" For Epstein to Traffic Ms. Giuffre to The
Rich and Famous.
Defendant next argues that she did not act as a "Madame" for Epstein. MSJ at 63. The
gist of the argument seems to be that Defendant believes trafficking one girl to Epstein does not
a Madame make. Call this the "yes-I-was-Virginia's-Madame-but-no-one-else's" defense. This
argument fails linguistically on the very dictionary definitions that Defendant cites elsewhere -
56 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24; 74:2-74:7.
51 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 44, FOIA CD GIUFFRE 007584.


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page72 of 74
but not here. See Merriam-Webster (11" ed. 2006) (defining "madam" as "the female head of a
house of prostitution").
Once again, Defendant conceals the relevant facts on this issue. First, multiple witnesses
have testified to Defendant's recruiting, maintaining, harboring, and trafficking girls for
Epstein. In fact, Defendant herself was unable to deny procuring Ms. Giuffre for Epstein."9
While Defendant has attempted to fumble her way through explaining some plausible reason for
bringing a sixteen or seventeen year old to Epstein, her explanations are, to put it blandly,
unpersuasive. As with other issues, the jury will have to decide who to believe.
One of the individuals Ms. Giuffre was trafficked to was Prince Andrew - trafficking that
took place in Defendant's own townhouse in London. There exist flight logs evidencing Ms.
Giuffre flying to London alongside Defendant and Epstein on Epstein's private plane, and a
photo of Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, and the Prince, without Defendant ever offering a legal
reasonable explanation for that photo being taken, or for traveling with a year old girl overseas.
Defendant begins to meander somewhat aimlessly on this point, shifting Plaintiff's
burden to substantiate Plaintiff's claim that Defendant was Epstein's Madame, which is a point
at issue, into whether or not Plaintiff has conclusively proven the identities and accurate job titles
of the other men to whom Plaintiff was lent for sex by Epstein. No matter how hard Defendant
tries to reframe this case, drag other people in, or split hairs, she is unable to contest the facts -
facts showing she was more than a Madame but a full-fledged sex trafficker. Ms. Giuffre told the
truth when she said that Defendant recruited her as a minor, under the pretense of giving a
58 See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, 1, 18, 2, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 13; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 34; GIUFFRE000105 at 57-

massage, and converted her into a traveling sex slave, consistent with Defendant and Epstein's
pattern and practice.
As the Court astutely acknowledged early on, "at the center of this case is the veracity of
a contextual world of facts more broad than the allegedly defamatory statements... either
transgression occurred or it did not. Either Maxwell was involved or she was not." If Defendant
was involved, then her January 2015 statement was defamatory. Ms. Giuffre will prove to the
jury, through overwhelming evidence, her prior allegations about Defendant's involvement. The
Court should give Ms. Giuffre that opportunity, and deny Defendant's motion for summary
judgment.
IX.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Defendant's motion for summary
judgment in all respects.

United States District Court
Southern District of New York
Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff,
Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
V.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK LOCAL RULE 56.1 PLAINTIFF'S
STATEMENT OF CONTESTED FACTS AND PLAINTIFF'S UNDISPUTED FACTS
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
Ms. Maxwell's response to publications of Ms. Giuffre's false allegations: the March
2011 statement. In early 2011 Ms. Giuffre in two British tabloid interviews made
numerous false and defamatory allegations against Ms. Maxwell. In the articles, Ms.
Giuffre made no direct allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in any improper
conduct with Jeffrey Epstein, who had pleaded guilty in 2007 to procuring a minor for
prostitution. Nonetheless, Ms. Giuffre suggested that Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein
and may have known about the crime for which he was convicted.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre denies that the allegations she made against Ms. Maxwell are false.
Furthermore, Ms. Giuffre did give an interview to journalist, Sharon Churcher, in which Ms.
Giuffre accurately and truthfully described Defendant Maxwell's role as someone who recruited
or facilitated the recruitment of young females for Jeffrey Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 34, GIUFFRE003678. Ms. Giuffre was also interviewed by the FBI in 2011 and she
discussed Defendant's involvement in the sexual abuse. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31, FBI
Redacted 302, FIUFFRE001235-1246. Those statements were not "false and defamatory," but
instead truthful and accurate.

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page2 of 66
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
In the articles, Ms. Giuffre alleged she had sex with Prince Andrew, "a well-known
businessman," a "world-renowned scientist," a "respected liberal politician," and a
"foreign head of state."
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre does not contest this fact, but believes that it is irrelevant.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
In response to the allegations Ms. Maxwell's British attorney, working with Mr. Gow,
issued a statement on March 9, 2011, denying "the various allegations about [Ms.
Maxwell] that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely
false."
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre denies that Mr. Barden, "issued a statement." Instead it appears to have the
contact as Ross Gow and a reference to Devonshire Solicitors.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
The statement read in full:
Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell
By Devonshires Solicitors, PRNE Wednesday, March 9, 2011
London, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about her
that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false.
It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms. Maxwell's legal representatives to certain
newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be withdrawn have
simply been ignored
In the circumstances, Ms. Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against those
newspapers.
"I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain
newspapers live by the adage, "why let the truth get in the way of a good story."
However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask
that they stop," said Ghislaine Maxwell.
"A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their reporting of
this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation or any real due
diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name," she said.

MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
The document speaks for itself although it is unclear if the original included the italics
that are inserted by the Defendant above.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
Ms. Giuffre's gratuitous and "lurid" accusations in an unrelated action. In 2008 two
alleged victims of Epstein brought an action under the Crime Victims' Rights Act against
the United States government purporting to challenge Epstein's plea agreement. They
alleged the government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the agreement.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
While we would stipulate to the statement in this paragraph starting with the words "In
2008'
, we do not stipulate to the opening sentence fragment Maxwell places in bold.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
Seven years later, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA action,
claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January 1, 2015,
Ms. Giuffre filed a "corrected" ioinder motion.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Agreed.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
The issue presented in her joinder motion was narrow: whether she should be permitted
to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21,
specifically, whether she was a "known victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the Government
wed them CVRA duties." Yet, "the bulk of the [motion] consists of copious factua
letails that [Ms. Giuffre] and [her co-movant 'would prove... if allowed to ioin.'" Ms
3


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page4 of 66
Giuffre gratuitously included provocative and "lurid details" of her alleged sexual
activities as an alleged victim of sexual trafficking.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre denies that the issues presented in here joinder motion were narrow. The
issues presented by the joinder motion and related pleadings were multiple and complex,
requiring numerous details about Ms. Giuffre's sexual abuse and the perpetrators of her abuse.
In a pleading explaining why the motion was filed, Ms. Giuffre's lawyers specifically listed nine
separate reasons why Jane Doe 3's allegations that Dershowitz had sexually abused her were
relevant to the case and appropriately included in the relevant filings:
1.
To establish that Jane Doe 3 had been sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein
and his co-conspirators (including co-conspirator Alan Dershowitz), which would make
her a "victim" of a broad sex trafficking conspiracy covered by the federal Crime
Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, and therefore entitled to participate in the case;
2. To support then-pending discovery requests that asked specifically for
information related to contacts by Dershowitz with the Government on behalf of
Jeffrey Epstein;
3. To support the victims' allegation that the Government had a motive for
failing to afford victims with their rights in the criminal process - specifically,
pressure from Dershowitz and other members of Epstein's legal defense team to
keep the parameters of the non-prosecution agreement (NPA) secret to prevent
Jane Doe 3 and other victims from objecting to and blocking judicial approval of
the agreement;
4. To establish the breadth of the NPA's provision extending immunity to
"any potential co-conspirators of Epstein" and the scope of the remedy that the
victims (including not only Jane Doe 3 but also other similarly-situated minor
victims who had been sexually abused by Dershowitz) might be able to obtain for
violations of their rights;
5. To provide part of the factual context for the scope of the "interface"
between the victims, the Government, and Epstein's defense team - an interface
that was relevant under Judge Marra's previous ruling that the Government was
entitled to raise "a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be considered in
the factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant
prosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims ...";
4


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page5 of 66
6. To prove the applicability of the "crime/fraud/misconduct" exception to
the attorney-client privilege that was being raised by the Government in
opposition to the victims' motion for production of numerous documents;
7. To bolster the victims' argument that their right "to be treated with
fairness," 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), had been violated through the Government's
secret negotiations with one of their abusers;
8. To provide notice and lay out the parameters of potential witness
testimony for any subsequent proceedings or trial - i.e.., the scope of the testimony
that Jane Doe 3 was expected to provide in support of Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2,
the already-recognized Ms. Giuffre in the action; and
9. To support Jane Doe 3's argument for equitable estoppel to toll the six-
mar statute of -me toas be saraised s tohed beeshen as in hosion to her
notion to join - 1.€
Australia due to the danger posed by Epstein and his powerful friends, including
prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz.
Jane Does #1 and #2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736, DE 291 at 18-26 & n.17 (S.D. Fla.
2015). Ms. Giuffre's lawyers had attempted to obtain a stipulation from the Government on
point #1 above ("victim" status), but the Government had declined. Judge Marra's ruling
concluded that certain allegations were not necessary "at this juncture in the proceedings." DE
324 at 5. Judge Marra specifically added, however, that "Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these
factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should Petitioners demonstrate a good faith
basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter presented for the Court's
consideration." DE 324 at 6. The CVRA litigation continues and no trial has been held as of the
filing of this brief. As such, the extent to which these factual details will be used at trial has not
yet been determined. See Docket Sheet, Jane Does #1 and #2 v. U.S., No. 9:08-cv-80736.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
8.
At the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew that the media had
been following the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately
filed the motion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre's name, claiming the need for privacy
and secrecy, they made no attempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they
filed the motion publicly.

MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
See Ms. Giuffre's Response to Point #7, above.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
As the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre "name[d] several
indıviduals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they
took place." The court ruled that "these lurid details are unnecessary": "The factua
details regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are
allegations relating to her alleged sexual activities and her allegations of misconduct by
non-parties. The court said the striking of the "lurid details" was a sanction for Ms.
Giuffre's improper inclusion of them in the motion.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
See Ms. Giuffre's Response to Point #7, above.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
10.
The district court found not only that the "lurid details" were unnecessary but also that
the entire joinder motion was "entirely unnecessary." Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew
the motion with all its "lurid details" was unnecessary because the motion itself
recognized that she would be able to participate as a fact witness to achieve the same
result she sought as a party. The court denied Ms. Giuffre's joinder motion.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
See Ms. Giuffre's Response to Point #7, above.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
11.
One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre "named" repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms.
Maxwell. According to the "lurid details" of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms.
Maxwell personally was involved in a "sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme" created
by Epstein:
• Ms. Maxwell "approached" Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was "fifteen
years old" to recruit her into the scheme.
•
Ms. Maxwell was "one of the main women" Epstein used to "procure under-aged
girls for sexual activities."
Ms. Maxwell was a "primary co-conspirator" with Epstein in his scheme.
6


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page7 of 66
• She "persuaded" Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein's mansion "in a fashion very similar to
the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other
children."
• At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms.
Maxwell "turned it into a sexual encounter."
• Epstein "with the assistance of" Ms. Maxwell "converted [Ms. Giuffre] into .... a
"sex slave. " Id. Ms. Giuffre was a "sex slave" from "about 1999 through 2002."
Ms. Maxwell also was a "co-conspirator in Epstein's sexual abuse."
Ms. Maxwell "appreciated the immunity" she acquired under Epstein's plea
agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution "for the crimes she
committed in Florida."
•
Ms. Maxwell "participat[ed] in the sexual abuse of [Ms. Giuffre] and others."
• Ms. Maxwell "took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in
sexual activities, including [Ms. Giuffre]." Id. She shared the photos with Epstein.
• As part of her "role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring "Ms. Maxwell "connected]"
Epstein with "powerful individuals" so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these
persons.
• Ms. Giuffre was "forced to have sexual relations" with Prince Andrew in
• "[Ms. Maxwell's] apartment" in London. Ms. Maxwell "facilitated" Ms. Giuffre's
• sex with Prince Andrew "by acting as a 'madame' for Epstein."
• Ms. Maxwell "assist[ed] in internationally trafficking" Ms. Giuffre and "numerous
other young girls for sexual purposes."
• Ms. Giuffre was "forced" to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others "engage in
illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls."
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
See Ms. Giuffre's Response to Point #7, above. Ms. Giuffre contests the reference to
"lurid details". Moreover, the testimony from numerous witnesses corroborates the statements
Ms. Giuffre made in her joinder motion. See below.

In the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre also alleged she was "forced" to have sex with
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, "model scout" Jean Luc Brunel, and "many
other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful
business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world
leaders."

MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Agreed that Ms. Giuffre made this statement and has since discovered evidence that
indicates she was mistaken on the exact timeframe of her abuse and was with Defendant and
Jeffrey Epstein from the years 2000 - 2002.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
14.
Ms. Giuffre suggested the government was part of Epstein's "conspiracy" when it
"secretly" negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding federal
prosecution of Epstein and his "co-conspirators." The government's secrecy, Ms. Giuffre
alleged, was motivated by its fear that Ms. Giuffre would raise "powerful objections" to
the agreement that would have "shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other
powerful individuals.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre did not suggest that the Government was part of Epstein's conspiracy to
commit sex offenses. The CVRA case deals with whether the Government failed in their
responsibilities to the victims to inform the victims that the Government was working out a NPA,
9


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page10 of 66
and it is Ms. Giuffre's belief that the Government did fail to so inform the victims, and
intentionally did not inform the victims because the expected serious objection from many of the
victims might prevent the Government from finalizing a NPA with Epstein. See McCawley Dec.
at Exhibit 50, Joinder Motion (GIUFFRE00319-00333).
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
15.
Notably, the other "Jane Doe" who joined Ms. Giuffre's motion who alleged she was
sexually abused "many occasions" by Epstein was unable to corroborate any of Ms.
Giuffre's allegations.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
This is untrue. The other Jane Doe could corroborate many of Ms. Giuffre's allegations
based on a similar pattern of abuse that she suffered by Epstein. She did not know Ms. Giuffre
though.
, who was deposed in this case, and who was a minor, corroborates the
same pattern of abuse. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 7,
Dep. Tr. at 54:25-57:5.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
16.
Also notably, in her multiple and lengthy consensual interviews with Ms. Churcher three
years earlier, Ms. Giuffre told Ms. Churcher of virtually none of the details she described
in the joinder motion.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
This is untrue. Furthermore, Defendant does not offer any citation or evidence on this
point.
Defendant's statement here is knowingly false. Having read the articles and taken Ms.
Giuffre's deposition, Defendant knows that Ms. Giuffre did reveal details in 2011 consistent with
those in the joinder motion. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31, GIUFFRE003678, FBI Redacted

motion, members of the media obtained copies of the motion.

See Ms. Giuffre's Response to Point #7, above.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
18.
At Mr. Barden's direction, on January 3, 2015, Mr. Gow sent to numerous representatives
of British media organizations an email containing "a quotable statement on behalf of
Ms. Maxwell." The email was sent to more than 6 and probably less than 30 media
representatives. It was not sent to non-media representatives.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Defendant falsely claims that "[a]t Mr. Barden's direction, on January 3, 2015, Mr. Gow
sent to numerous representatives of British media organizations an email containing 'a quotable
statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.' This is a blatant falsehood about the document that is at
the heart of this litigation. Record evidence shows that Gow sent that email at Defendant's
direction, not at Mr. Barden's direction. Indeed, on the evening before his deposition, Mr. Gow
produced an email exchange he had with Defendant in which Defendant directs Mr. Gow to send
the press statement. It is as follows:
From: G Maxwell <GMax1@elimax.com>
Date: Fri, 2 Jan 2015 20:14:53 +0000
To: Ross Gow<ross@acuityreputation.com>
Cc: Philip Barden<philip.barden@devonshires.co.uk>
Subject: FW: URGENT - this is the statement
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts so not a new individual.
The allegations made by Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.
The original allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to
be untrue
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschwitz is
involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised
as news, as they are defamatory.
11


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page12 of 66
Chronologically, this email comes at the end of various other email exchanges between
Defendant and Gow that discuss issuing a press release. The subject line of this email that
Defendant wrote to Gow states "URGENT - this is the statement," thereby instructing Gow to
release this statement to the press. Shortly after Defendant sent this email to Gow directing him
to release the statement, Gow distributed the statement to multiple media outlets. Neither
Defendant nor Gow have produced any email in which Barden directed Gow to issue this press
release (nor can they).
Despite sending it herself, and despite it being responsive to six court-ordered search
terms, Defendant failed to produce this email. Her press agent, Gow, produced this the evening
before his deposition on November 17, 2016. At the deposition, Mr. Gow authenticated this
email and confirmed that Defendant authorized the statement:
Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell's retention of your
services?
A. Yes, I was.
***
(Exhibit 9 was marked for identification.)
Q. This also appears to be an email chain with you and Ms. Maxwell; is that correct?
A. It does appear to be so.
Q. Did you send the top email of the chain that says "Okay, G, going with this"?
A. I did.
Q. And did you receive from Ms. Maxwell, the bottom email of that chain?
A. I believe so. Well, I believe -- yes, yeah, it was forwarded from Ms. Maxwell, yes.
MR. DYER: Sorry, I don't quite understand that answer.
THE WITNESS: I misspoke that. I did receive it from Ms. Maxwell.
MR. DYER: Okay.
Q. The subject line does have "FW" which to me indicates it's a forward. Do you know
where the rest of this email chain is?
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by
Ms. Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate
action. I therefore respond, "Okay, Ghislaine, I'II go with this."
It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the
second one is "Urgent, this is the statement" so I take that as an instruction to send it out,
as a positive command: "This is the statement."
12


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page13 of 66
See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, November 18, 2016, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 44:6-
45:13.
Together, the email and Gow's testimony unequivocally establish that Defendant - not
Barden - directed and "command[ed]" Gow to publish the defamatory statement. Accordingly,
the first sentence of Defendant's Paragraph 18 is false.
The second sentence - "This email was sent to more than 6 and probably less than 30
media representatives" - omits the fact that not only did Gow admit to emailing the statement to
the press, but he also read it to over 30 media representatives over the phone:
Q. Do you recall ever reading the statement to the press or the media over the phone?
A. It's very possible that I would have done so, yes.
See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep. Tr. at 66:2-25.
Q. Do you -- do you remember discussing that with The Guardian?
A. No, I don't. I'm not saying I didn't but I can't recall. You have to bear in mind, if you'd
be so kind, that I've been speaking to over 30 journalists and media outlets about this,
and I can't recall every single -- the detail of every single conversation.
See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep. Tr. at 64:8-14 (emphasis added). Thus, the second
sentence of Defendant's Paragraph 18 is also false.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
19.
Among the media representatives were Martin Robinson of the Daily Mail; P. Peachey of
The Independent; Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror; David Brown of The Times; and Nick
Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC; and David Mercer of the Press Association.
These representatives were selected based on their request-after the joinder motion was
filed-for a response from Ms. Maxwell to Ms. Giuffre's allegations in the motion.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre agrees to the first sentence. The second sentence is a false. Accordingly,
there is no record evidence that Gow (or anyone else) "selected" journalists "for a response," or
that there was any selection process whatsoever. To the contrary, Gow testified that anyone who
inquired received a reference to the January 2015 defamatory response:
13


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page14 of 66
Q. To the extent you can recall or could estimate, how many other emails do you believe
you sent bearing that statement that's in Exhibit 2?
A. I really can't remember but certainly more than six and probably less than 30,
somewhere in between. Any time there was an incoming query it was either dealt with on
the telephone by referring them back to the two statements of March 2011 and January
2015 or someone would email them the statement. So no one was left unanswered,
broadly, is the -- is where we were. But I can't remember every single person we reached
out to.

Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend it as a traditional
press release solely to disseminate information to the media. So he intentionally did not
pass it through a public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow's firm, Acuity Reputation.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Defendant states: "Mr. Barden, who prepared the statement, did not intend it as a
traditional press release solely to dissemination information to the media." Ms. Giuffre contests
this statement, and all statements regarding Mr. Barden's beliefs and purposes, and the like.
Further, as stated in detail in Ms. Giuffre's Opposition Defendant's Motion for Summary
Judgment, this Court should not even consider the Barden Declaration. Additionally, there is
absolutely no record evidence of Barden's intent and the Court should not consider it.
The next sentence states, "So he intentionally did not pass it [the press release] through a
public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow's firm, Acuity Reputation." Again, there is zero record
evidence to support any assertion of Barden's intent. To the extent that this sentence claims that
Barden did not give the statement to Gow, Ms. Giuffre does not dispute it; as described above,
Defendant gave the statement to Gow with instructions to publish it. See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 48, RG(UK)_000009, imaged in full at paragraph 81, supra. To the extent that this
sentence claims that the statement did not pass "through a public relations firm, such as Mr.
Gow's firm, Acuity Reputation," Ms. Giuffre disputes that statement. Record documentary
evidence and testimony establish that this statement was disseminated through a public relations
firm, namely, Ross Gow's firm, Acuity Reputation. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep.
Tr. at 109:4-6 ("Q. Approximately how long have you been providing such services? A. Acuity

22.
The January 2015 statement served two purposes. First, Mr. Barden intended that it
mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's reputation from the press's republication of Ms.
Giuffre's false allegations. He believed these ends could be accomplished by suggesting
to the media that, among other things, they should subject Ms. Giuffre's allegations to
inquiry and scrutiny. For example, he noted in the statement that Ms. Giuffre's
allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they are "obvious lies" and
therefore should not be "publicized as news."
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre objects to this paragraph in its entirety. She disputes that the January 2015
statement "served two purposes," as this statement is wholly unsupported by the record, which
Defendant again neglects to cite. Ms. Giuffre also contests the second sentence in which
Defendant claims that "Mr. Barden intended that it mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's
reputation from the press's republication of Ms. Giuffre's false allegations." First, Ms. Giuffre
disputes any statement of Barden's intent as explained above. Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that
there was any "republication" by the press as a matter of law, as explained in her memorandum
of law opposing summary judgment, as the press did not "republish" the press statement under
New York law. Third, Ms. Giuffre disputes that her allegations are "false," and cites to the
following non-exhaustive sampling of evidence to corroborate her allegations against Defendant:

Next, Defendant states, "He [Barden] believed these ends could be accomplished by
suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject Ms. Giuffre's allegations to
inquiry and scrutiny." Ms. Giuffre disputes any statement as to Barden's "belief" (supra). Ms.
Giuffre disputes that the harm to Defendant's reputation could be mitigated by the media's
inquiry into and scrutiny of Ms. Giuffre's allegations, because a deeper inquiry would only
reveal additional evidence corroborating Ms. Giuffre's allegations, such as the evidence put forth
in Ms. Giuffre's opposition memorandum of law and detailed in the bulleted citations, supra.
Defendant then states,
, "For example, he [Barden] noted in the statement that Ms.
Giuffre's allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they are 'obvious lies' and
therefore should not be 'publicized as news."" First, Ms. Giuffre disputes that Barden noted
anything in the statement, as that is unsubstantiated by the record evidence. Not to do
Defendant's work for her, but the closest evidence Defendant has for such a statement is
testimony from the Gow deposition wherein Gow speculates that Barden "had a hand in"
drafting the press statement, an opinion which may or may not be based on first-hand
knowledge. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep. Tr. at 45:14-17 (Q. Okay. A. And I say,
"Thanks, Philip" because I'm aware of the fact that he had a hand, a considerable hand in the
drafting.") This is wholly insufficient to show who drafted the passages quoted by Defendant
above. Regardless of those passages' original author, it is ultimately Defendant who "noted"
anything because it is her statement and she directed that it be sent to the media and public.
19


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page20 of 66
Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that her allegations have changed over time, "dramatically"
or otherwise. Third, Ms. Giuffre disputes that the press release "suggested]" that her allegations
are "obvious lies," because Defendant's press release affirmatively, unambiguously stated that
her allegations are "obvious lies" - there is no subtlety, suggestion, or statement of opinion here.
See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp.3d 147, 152 (S.D.N. Y. 2016) ("... these statements (as they
themselves allege), are capable of being proven true or false, and therefore constitute actionable
fact and not opinion."
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
23.
Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be "a shot across the bow" of
the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish Ms. Giuffre's allegations
without conducting any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly
noted that Ms. Giuffre's allegations were "defamatory." In this sense, the statement was
intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients
understand the seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of Ms.
Giuffre's obviously false allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
This paragraph is another purported statement of Defendant's counsel's "intent."
Defendant states: "Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be a 'shot across
the bow' of the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish Ms. Giuffre's'
allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own." Not only does Defendant once again
refer to Mr. Barden's intent, but she also mischaracterizes the statement as a "shot across the
bow" of the media. The press release did not threaten or give warning to the media in any way
whatsoever. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 26, GM_00068, full image copied in Ms. Giuffre's
Paragraph 18, supra.
Next, Ms. Giuffre disputes the sentence, "Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly
noted that Ms. Giuffre's allegations were 'defamatory.'" Barden did not "note" anything in the
statement, nor does Defendant cite to any record evidence that he does. Furthermore, Ms. Giuffre
20


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page21 of 66
denies that any of her allegations are defamatory in the slightest, as they are all true and
substantiated by record evidence (supra).
Ms. Giuffre also disputes the sentence, 'In this sense, the statement was intended as a
cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the
seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of Ms. Giuffre's obviously false
allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct." First, Ms. Giuffre objects to any
statement of Barden's intent, as articulated above. Second, Defendant's conventional press
release was in no way any type of "cease and desist letter." There is no record evidence in
support of this claim, and Defendant unsurprisingly cites to none. Third, Ms. Giuffre disputes
that any media-recipients would be given to understand "the seriousness with which Ms.
Maxwell considered the publication of Ms. Giuffre's obviously false allegations and the legal
indefensibility of their own conduct" by Defendant's self-serving press release, as that is
unsupported by the record. Finally, Ms. Giuffre rejects that her allegations are "obviously false,"
a claim which is completely unsupported by record evidence.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
24.
Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow's emails prefaced the statement with the
following language: "Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms.
Maxwell" (emphasis supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-time-
only, comprehensive response quoted in full—to Ms. Giuffre's December 30, 2014,
allegations that would give the media Ms. Maxwell's response. The purpose of the
prefatory statement was to inform the media-recipients of this intent.

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page22 of 66
Ms. Giuffre disputes that any part of Defendant's press release is "consistent with those
two [of Barden's] purposes." Indeed, Ms. Giuffre disputes this and any statement relating to
Barden's "purposes," as explained above.
Next, Ms. Giuffre disputes that, 'The statement was intended to be a single, one-time-
only, comprehensive response - quoted in full - to Ms. Giuffre's December 30, 2014, allegations
that would give the media Ms. Maxwell's response." First, Ms. Giuffre disputes this and any
statement relating to Barden's "intent" as explained above. Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that
anyone intended the press release to be a one-time-only, comprehensive response. The record
evidence says otherwise: Gow repeatedly issued this statement via email and over the phone for
months on end.
Next, Defendant states, "The purpose of the prefatory statement was to inform the media-
recipients of this intent." First, Ms. Giuffre disputes this and any statement relating to Barden's
purpose as explained above. Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that the press release was to inform
the media of anything. Defendant issued a press release, instructed them to publish it (by telling
them it was "quotable"), see McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 48, RG(UK)_ 000009 (supra), and hired
a press agent to feed it to the press:
Q. Did Ms. Maxwell retain the services of you or your firm?
A. Yes, she did.
***
Q. Is it your belief that that agreement was in effect on January 2nd, 2015?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you recall the terms of that agreement?
A. Well, it was a re-establishment of an existing agreement so if we go back to the
original agreement, it was to provide public relations services to Ms. Maxwell in the
matter of Giuffre and her activities.
22


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page23 of 66
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6 Gow Dep. Tr. at 12:19-21; 13:9-16. The record evidence shows
that Defendant's intent was for the press to publish her press release: any other interpretation is
not only contrary to logic, but unsupported by the record.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
25.
Ms. Giuffre's activities to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. Ms.
Giuffre has engaged in numerous activities to bring attention to herself, to the prosecution
and punishment of wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest of
bringing light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Agreed to the portion of Defendant's assertion in bold font. Ms. Giuffre has not engaged
in activities to bring attention to herself, rather she has taken action to aid in the prosecution of
her abusers, and she seeks to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
Ms. Giuffre created an organization, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida corporation,
directly related to her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre created Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., in order to help other sexually
trafficked victims find the resources they need to recover and heal. See
www.victimsrefusesilence.org.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
27.
The "goal" of Victims Refuse Silence "was, and continues to be, to help survivors
abuse: toward this sild, Manife has indicateally er perissied by te to me of sexual
victims of sex trafficking"
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Agreed.

MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Denied. Ms. Giuffre was approached by numerous media outlets and refused to speak to
most of them. Media organizations sought her out; she did not seek them out. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 35, GIUFFRE003690, email from Sharon Churcher seeking to interview Ms.
Giuffre.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
On December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre publicly filed an "entirely unnecessary" joinder
motion laden with "unnecessary," "lurid details" about being "sexually abused" as a
"minor victim[]" by wealthy and famous men and being "trafficked" all around the world
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
See Ms. Giuffre's Paragraph 7, supra, listing multiple reasons why details were, in fact,
necessary.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
30.
The Ms. Giuffre's alleged purpose in filing the joinder motion was to "vindicate" her
rights under the CVRA, expose the government's "secretly negotiated" "non-prosecution
agreement" with Epstein, "shed tremendous public light" on Epstein and "other powerful
individuals" that would undermine the agreement, and support the CVRA Ms. Giuffre's'
reauest for documents that would show how Epstein "used his powerful political anc
social connections to secure a favorable plea deal" and the government's "motive" to aid

See Ms. Giuffre's Paragraph 7, supra, listing multiple purposes of Ms. Giuffre's lawyers'
filing of the motion.

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page25 of 66
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
31.
Ms. Giuffre has written the manuscript of a book she has been trying to publish detailing
her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse and of sex trafficking in Epstein's
alleged "sex scheme."
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
See Ms. Giuffre's Paragraph 52, infra, explaining that the context of this statement is
misleading.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
32.
Republication alleged by Ms. Giuffre. Ms. Giuffre was required by Interrogatory No. 6
to identify any false statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell that were " published globally,
including within the Southern District of New York,"' as Ms. Giuffre alleged in
Paragraph 9 of Count I of her complaint. In response, Ms. Giuffre identified the January
2015 statement and nine instances in which various news media published portions of the
January 2015 statement in news articles or broadcast stories.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre objects to this paragraph in its entirety, starting with the bolded heading
("Republication alleged by Ms. Giuffre"). There is no "republication" as a matter of law in this
case, as explained in Ms. Giuffre's memorandum of law. Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre is not and has
not alleged republication. As noted in her objection that, it is Defendant who possesses the
knowledge as to where the defamatory statements were published; unsurprisingly, Defendant
failed to comply with Ms. Giuffre's discovery requests on the same.
As Defendant already knows, Ms. Giuffre provided a sampling of Defendant's
defamatory statements published by the news media, as "identification of an exhaustive
responsive list would be unduly burdensome." This, of course, is because Defendant caused her
statement to be published in an enormous number of media outlets. Ms. Giuffre's full response to
Interrogatory No. 6 is below. As the Court can see, these nine instances were a good-faith effort
to provide some samples (as it would be virtually impossible to provide all of them), below. Ms.
25


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page26 of 66
Giuffre has also put forth an exhaustive expert report and expert testimony from Jim Jansen
regarding the dissemination of Defendant's defamatory press release.
Ms. Giuffre objects because the information interrogatory above is in the
possession of Defendant who has failed to comply with her production obligations
in this matter, and has failed to comply with her production obligations with this
very subject matter. See Document Request No. 17 from Ms. Giuffre's Second
Request for Production of Documents to Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell
has not produced all "URL or Internet addresses for any internet version of such
publication" that she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to send.
Ms. Giuffre further objects because the information requested above is in
the possession of Defendant's agent, who caused the false statements to be issued
o various media outlets. Ms. Giuffre has not had the opportunity to depos
Maxwell's agent Ross Gow: therefore, this answer remains incomplet
Consequently, Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or supplement
her responses, as information is largely in the possession of the Defendant and her
agent. Ms. Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in that it violates Rule 33 as its
subparts, in combination with the other interrogatories, exceed the allowable
twenty-five interrogatories. Ms. Giuffre objects to this request because it is in the
public domain. Ms. Giuffre also objects in that it seeks information protected by
the attorney-client/work product privilege, and any other applicable privilege
stated in the General Objections.
Notwithstanding such objections, Ms. Giuffre has already produced
documents supplements such responsive documents with the following list of
publications. While the identification of an exhaustive responsive list would be
unduly burdensome, in an effort to make a good faith effort towards compliance,
Ms. Giuffre provides the following examples, which are incomplete based on the
aforementioned reasons:

Statement/URL
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual.
The allegations made by Victoria Roberts against
Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown
to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told it changes with new
salacious details about public figures and world leaders
and now it is alleged by Ms. Roberts that Alan
Dershowitz is involved in having sexual relations with
her, which he denies.
Ms. Roberts's claims are obvious lies and should be
treated as such and not publicized as news, as they are
defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and
defamatory claims remains the same. Maxwell strongly
denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have
appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves
her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old

DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
33.
In none of the nine instances was there any publication of the entire January 2015
statement.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
While there may be certain publications who did not print every word of Defendant's
lengthy press release, most publications quoted the most salient, to-the-point parts of
Defendant's statement that call Ms. Giuffre a liar. In each of the nine articles listed above, the
defamatory statement, as articulated by the Complaint and as identified by the Court as
actionable, is published. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp.3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)
("statements that Giuffre's claims 'against [Defendant] are untrue,' have been 'shown to be
untrue,' and are 'obvious lies' have a specific and readily understood factual meaning: that
Giuffre is not telling the truth about her history of sexual abuse and Defendant's role, and that
some verifiable investigation has occurred and come to a definitive conclusion proving that fact.
Second, these statements (as they themselves allege), are capable of being proven true or false,
and therefore constitute actionable fact and not opinion"). Ms. Giuffre also put forth extensive
evidence of the mass distribution of Defendant's defamatory statement to over 66 million
viewers through her expert witness Jim Jansen. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 24, Expert Report
of Jim Jansen.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
34.
Ms. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or authority over any media
organization, including the media identified in Ms. Giuffre's response to Interrogatory
No. 6, in connection with the media's publication of portions of the January 2015
statement.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre disputes this statement in its entirety, as it is completely devoid of record
evidence. In fact, the record establishes the contrary. First, Defendant hired Gow because his
28


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page29 of 66
position allowed him to influence the press to publish her defamatory statement. A sampling of
Gow's testimony establishes just that:
Q.
A.
***
Q.
A.
Q.
A.
Did Ms. Maxwell retain the services of you or your firm?
Yes, she did.
Is it your belief that that agreement was in effect on January 2nd, 2015?
Yes.
Do you recall the terms of that agreement?
Well, it was a re-establishment of an existing agreement so if we go back to the
original agreement, it was to provide public relations services to Ms. Maxwell in
the matter of Giuffre and her activities.
***
Q.
You can answer -- to the extent that anything you testify to is not protected by a
privilege.
A.
Ms. Roberts first came to my attention on or around March 2011 when I was
called into a meeting with Philip Barden and Ms. Maxwell at Devonshires law office,
that
she had made -- Ms. Giuffre had made extremely unpleasant allegations about
Ms.
Maxwell's private life. We were -- Acuity Reputation, my firm was called in to
protect Ms. Maxwell's reputation, and to set the record straight. That was -- and
that
work commenced on or around March of 2011.
***
Does this document fairly depict pages from your -- from Acuity Reputation's
website?
A.
It does.
Q.
Do you see where it says "We manage reputation and forge opinion through
public relations, strategic communications and high level networking"?
A.
I do.
Q.
Is that a true statement?
A.
Say it again. Sorry.
Q.
Is that a true statement?
A.
It is, yes. I wrote that statement.
***
Q.
A.
Q.
Okay. Do you see where your website claims that your company has "excellent
relationships with the media"?
I do.
Is that a true statement?
29


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page30 of 66
A.
***
That is true, yeah.
Is it correct that you advertise your "excellent relationships with the media"
because your services often include giving communications to the media on
A.
behalf of your clients?
Yes.
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6 Gow Dep. Tr. at 13:9-16; 15:18-16:3; 109:12-22; 110:16-21;
111:3-7. In addition to testimonial evidence, the proof is also in the result. By using Gow to issue
her press release, Defendant caused her statement to be published by numerous major news
organizations with wide readership all over the globe. Accordingly, the record evidence shows
that Ms. Maxwell, through her agent, had immense control and authority over the media,
convincing major news outlets to publish her words based on nothing more than a single email
from Gow.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
35.
Ms. Giuffre's defamation action against Ms. Maxwell. Eight years after Epstein's guilty
plea, Ms. Giuffre brought this action, repeating many of the allegations she made in her
CVRA joinder motion.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Agreed, but noting that the defamation cause of action against Defendant did not accrue
until Defendant defamed her in January of 2015, the same year Ms. Giuffre filed suit against
Defendant for defamation.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
36.
The complaint alleged that the January 2015 statement "contained the following
deliberate falsehoods":
(a)
(b)
(c)
That Giuffre's sworn allegations "against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue."
That the allegations have been "shown to be untrue."
That Giuffre's "claims are obvious lies."
30


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page31 of 66
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Agreed. However, in discovery, Defendant was finally forced to produce the complete
press release she issued. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 26, GIUFFRE00068.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
37.
Ms. Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her fiancé long before meeting Epstein
or Ms. Maxwell. After leaving the Growing Together drug rehabilitation facility in 1999,
Ms. Giuffre moved in with the family of a fellow patient. There she met, and became
engaged to, her friend's brother, James Michael Austrich. She and Austrich thereafter rented
an apartment in the Ft. Lauderdale area with another friend and both worked at various jobs
in that area. Later, they stayed briefly with Ms. Giuffre's parents in the Palm Beach/
Loxahatchee, Florida area before Austrich rented an apartment for the couple on Bent Oak
Drive in Royal Palm Beach. Although Ms. Giuffre agreed to marry Austrich, she never had
any intention of doing so.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre did not voluntarily live independently from her parents with her fiancé, rather
Ms. Giuffre was a troubled minor child who was not truly engaged prior to meeting Defendant and
Epstein. Where Ms. Giuffre lived, and who she lived with, are not relevant to the issues being
decided in this action. Again, this is merely a transparent distraction from the case that is
actually at issue, and is being used for the sole purpose of inserting conjecture in an effort to
distract the Court and ultimately the jury.
Although Austrich testified that he proposed to Ms. Giuffre on Valentine's Day, see
Austrich at p. 19, Ms. Giuffre was a troubled teen who could not realistically be considered a
fiancé in the true sense of the word, nor was she of legal age to marry. In fact, as accurately
described by Defendant, Ms. Giuffre never had any intention of marrying Austrich. Giuffre Dep. Tr.
at 127:22-128:21. Given that Ms. Giuffre was a child with limited legal capacity at this point, and
that she did not have any intention of marrying Austrich, a reasonable person could not assert that
Ms. Giuffre was engaged
31


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page32 of 66
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
38.
Ms. Giuffre re-enrolled in high school from June 21, 2000 until March 7, 2002. After
finishing the 9th grade school year at Forest Hills High School on June 9, 1999, Ms.
Giuffre re-enrolled at Wellington Adult High School on June 21, 2000, again on August
16, 2000 and on August 14, 2001. On September 20, 2001, Ms. Giuffre then enrolled at
Royal Palm Beach High School. A few weeks later, on October 12, 2001, she
matriculated at Survivors Charter School. Id. Survivor's Charter School was an
alternative school designed to assist students who had been unsuccessful at more
traditional schools. Ms. Giuffre remained enrolled at Survivor's Charter School until
March 7, 2002. She was present 56 days and absent 13 days during her time there. Id.
Ms. Giuffre never received her high school diploma or GED. Ms. Giuffre and Figueroa
went "back to school" together at Survivor's Charter School. The school day there lasted
from morning until early afternoon.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre denies this statement. Either Defendant is blatantly misleading this Court or
Defendant simply does not understand how to interpret Ms. Giuffre's school records. The record
produced by Defendant (GM0888) is specifically titled "A07. Assignment History," which
reflects semester start and end dates per each 180 day school year, not dates that Ms. Giuffre
physically enrolled or withdrew from school. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 27, GM0888.

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page33 of 66
While "Grade 30" indicates adult education, Ms. Giuffre's attendance records indicate that she
was not present in school between 6/21/00-09/20/01 (see withdrawal codes W32 and W47).
WITHDRAWAL CODES: ADULT STUDENTS
• W26 - Any student who withdraws from school to enter the adult education program
prior to completion of graduation requirements.
• W32 - Any adult student who left the class/program to enter another training program.
• W47 - Any adult student who is procedurally withdrawn at the end of the term or school
year who will continue in the class/program the next term or school year.
http://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/8861/urlt/0094063-appendb.pdf
More importantly, Ms. Giuffre's school transcripts clearly indicate "NO COURSES
TAKEN" for the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 school years. (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 27,
GM _00893.) Ms. Giuffre's attempt to work and resume school at Survivor's Charter School as a
10"h grader in the 2001-2002 school year was limited to a portion of the school year (10/20/01-
03/07/02), and further substantiates Ms. Giuffre's testimony that she attempted to get away from
Epstein's abuse, along with the following testimony by Figueroa:
Q:
Was there a period of time between 2001 and when she left in 2002 here she was
not working for Jeffrey?
A:
Q:
A:
What period of time was that?
It was pretty much, like, when she was actually working as a server. Like,
basically because we were trying to not have her go back there. Like, she did not
want to go back there. And we were trying to just work without needing his
money, you know."
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 92-93
Q:
A:
So the thing that Virginia was tired of ... What was it that Virginia was trying to
get away from and stop with respect to working at Jeffrey Epstein's house?
To stop being used and abused.
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 248

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page34 of 66
Even still, if the records are correct, which Ms. Giuffre does not concede, the records
indicate that Ms. Giuffre's attendance was poor, with 69 days present and 32 days absent out of a
required 180 day school year and that she was not enrolled at the end of the school year
(emphasis added).

See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 27, GM_00893.
Ms. Giuffre's obvious gap in her school attendance, her presence verified by Epstein's
pilot on flight logs, and an abundence of witness testimony all corroborate her story that she was
that Ms. Giuffre was flying domestic and internationally with Epstein at least 32 times between
12/11/00-07/28/01 and 06/21/02-08/21/02 (Defendant traveling with Ms. Giuffre on 23 of the
flights). See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 15 and 41, Pilot, David Rodgers' Dep. Tr. 96:12-166;

Dec. at Exhibit 37, GIUFFRE004721 (passport application).
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
39.
During the year 2000, Ms. Giuffre worked at numerous jobs. In 2000, while living with
er fiancé, Ms. Giuffre held five different jobs: at Aviculture Breeding and Research
Center Southeast Employee Management Company, The Club at Mar-a-Lago, Oasis
Outsourcing, and Neiman Marcus. Her taxable earnings that year totaled nearly $9,000.
Ms. Giuffre cannot now recall either the Southeast Employee Management Company or
the Oasis Outsourcing jobs.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
35


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page36 of 66
Ms. Giuffre disputes this statement. During 2000, Ms. Giuffre shared an apartment with
her then boyfriend, James Michael Austrich and his friend, Mario. See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 2, Austrich Dep. Tr. at p. 92. Although Austrich testified that he proposed to Ms. Giuffre
on Valentine's Day, see Austrich at p. 19, Ms. Giuffre was a troubled teen who could not
realistically be considered a fiancé in the true sense of the word nor was she of legal age to
marry. While Ms. Giuffre held various jobs in 2000, "[SSA] records do not show the exact date
of employment (month and day) because [they] do not need this information to figure Social
Security benefits. " See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 46, GIUFFRE009176).
The reason that Ms. Giuffre cannot recall two companies listed on her SSA records
(Southeast Employee Management Company or Oasis Outsourcing) is simply because they were
not her employers. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 470-472. Had Defendant
bothered to run a simple google search, she could have ruled them out as being payroll and
benefit administration companies. See http://www.oasisadvantage.com/west-palm-beach-peo;
http://www.progressiveemployer.com/;
http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060501006151/en/Progressive-Employer-Services-
Purchases-Southeast-Employee-Management.
Ms. Giuffre has testified that she believes she worked at Taco Bell, at an aviary, then
Mar-a-Lago (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at p. 53, 470). Austrich also
testified that Ms. Giuffre worked with him at Taco Bell, as well as a pet store for "over a month"
before working at Mar-a-Lago (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Austrich Dep. Tr. at p. 16, 30,
98). Neither Taco Bell nor the pet store are listed on Ms. Giuffre's SSA records because they
were most likely paid through payroll companies. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 46,
GIUFFRE009178. Ms. Giuffre also testified that she volunteered at an aviary where they
36


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page37 of 66
eventually put her on their payroll, but paid her very little. Giuffre Dep. Tr. at p. 52; Aviculture
Breeding and Research Center taxable earnings for 2000 is $99.48, See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 46, GIUFFRE009178.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
40.
Ms. Giuffre's employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2000. Ms. Giuffre's
father, Sky Roberts, was hired as a maintenance worker at the The Mar-a-Lago Club in
Palm Beach, Florida, beginning on April 11, 2000. Mr. Roberts worked there year-round
for approximately 3 years. After working there for a period of time, Mr. Roberts became
acquainted with the head of the spa area and recommended Ms. Giuffre for a job there.
Mar-a-Lago closes every Mother's Day and reopens on November 1. Most of employees
Mar-a-Lago, including all employees of the spa area such as "spa attendants," are
"seasonal" and work only when the club is open, i.e., between November 1 and Mother's
Day. Ms. Giuffre was hired as a "seasonal" spa attendant to work at the Mar-a-Lago Club
in the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre disputes this statement. Defendant cannot simply infer Ms. Giuffre's
employment history and claim it to be undisputed. The Mar-a-Lago Club produced 177 pages of
records in response to Defendant's subpoena. However, not one page indicated Ms. Giuffre's
actual dates of employment, nor whether she was a full-time or seasonal employee. In fact, the
only significant record produced was a single, vague chart entry indicating that Ms. Giuffre was
terminated in 2000. MAR-A-LAGO 0173, 0176.

Job postings and job descriptions produced by Mar-a-Lago from 2002 and later are
irrelevant to Ms. Giuffre's employment because they are from after she worked there. Ms.
Giuffre testified that Mar-a-Lago was a summer job. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre
Dep. Tr. 56, 550. In fact, her father, Sky Roberts, testified that he referred his daughter for
employment, and she did not get the job through a posting (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17,
Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 72); he drove his daughter to and from work consistent with his full time
schedule (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 74); he believes the spa -
like the kitchen/dining room - was open to local guests in the summer (See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. 138-139); and that his daughter was not attending school when
she worked at Mar-a-Lago (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. 134). In
addition, Juan Alessi testified that it was "Summer" when Defendant approached Ms. Giuffre at
Mar-a-Lago because he specifically remembered "that day I was sweating like hell in the -- in
the car, waiting for Ms. Maxwell to come out of the massage." See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1,
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 94:24-95:2.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
41.
Ms. Giuffre represented herself as a masseuse for Jeffrey Epstein. While working at
the Mar-a-Lago spa and reading a library book about massage, Ms. Giuffre met Ms.
Maxwell. Ms. Giuffre thereafter told her father that she got a job working for Jeffrey
Epstein as a masseuse. Ms. Giuffre's father took her to Epstein's house on one occasion
around that time, and Epstein came outside and introduced himself to Mr. Roberts. Ms.
Giuffre commenced employment as a traveling masseuse for Mr. Epstein. Ms. Giuffre
was excited about her job as a masseuse, about traveling with him and about meeting
famous people. Ms. Giuffre represented that she was employed as a masseuse beginning
in January 2001. Ms. Giuffre never mentioned Ms. Maxwell to her then-fiancé, Austrich
Ms. Giuffre's father never met Ms. Maxwell.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre denies Defendant's false and factually unsupported narrative. In Florida, a
person cannot work as a masseuse unless she is "at least 18 years of age or has received a high
38


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page39 of 66
school diploma or high school equivalency diploma." Fla. Stat. § 480.041. Ms. Giuffre was a
minor child, under the age of 18, when she was working at Mar-a-Lago as a spa
attendant. Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 61:9-61:24. She was approached by Defendant, who told her she
could make money as a masseuse, a profession in which Ms. Giuffre had no experience. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21; 116:19-117:12. (Sky Roberts,
Ms. Giuffre father, verified Ms. Giuffre's account that Defendant recruited his daughter to "learn
massage therapy." See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 80:7-19; 84:18 -
85:1).
Ms. Giuffre's father drove her to Jeffrey Epstein's house, the address of which was given
to her by Defendant. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 117:20-118:1. Ms.
Giuffre was lead into the house, and was instructed by Defendant on how to give a massage,
during which Epstein and Defendant turned the massage into a sexual encounter, and offered Ms.
Giuffre money and a better life to be compliant in the sexual demands of Defendant and
Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 198:20-199:3; 199:15-199:18.
The minor Ms. Giuffre then began travelling with Defendant and Epstein on private planes and
servicing people sexually for money—working not as a legitimate masseuse, but in a position of
sexual servitude. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 5, 1, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 193:22-194:16;
201:24; 204:24:205:5; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 104:9-104:14.
Epstein's house manager, Juan Alessi, described Defendant's methodical routine of how
she prepared a list of places ahead of time, then drove to each place for the purpose of recruiting
girls to massage Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 18, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 34;
GIUFFRE000105 at 57-58; GIUFFRE000241-242 at p. 212-213. Alessi also stated that on
multiple occasions he drove Defendant to pre-planned places while she recruited girls for
39


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page40 of 66
massage. Id. He furthered testified that he witnessed Ms. Giuffre at Epstein's house on the very
same day that he witnessed Defendant recruit Ms. Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 18, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 96-98; GIUFFRE000102-103 at p. 48-49.
Johanna Sjoberg, through her sworn testimony, demonstrated that Defendant recruited
her in a similar fashion by driving to the college campus where she attended school and
approached her to work at Epstein's home answering phones. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16,
Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 8-9. Sjoberg testified that she answered phones for one day before
Defendant propositioned her to rub feet for $100.00 an hour. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16,
Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 13. The following day, Sjoberg was paired with Defendant's assistant,
Emmy Taylor, who provided her with massage training on Epstein. Sjoberg at 13-15. Ms.
Giuffre's then-boyfriend, Austrich, testified that he could not recall the name of the person who
recruited Ms. Giuffre. However, he did say that she was recruited by someone to work for
Epstein as a massage therapist, but that Ms. Giuffre did not have any experience. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 2, Austrich Dep. Tr. at 34-35, 100-101, 127-128. Neither Ms. Giuffre nor Sjoberg
were licensed or trained in massage, but were invited soon after being recruited to travel with
Epstein on his private plane to massage him. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Giuffre Dep. Tr.
at 16-17; Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 13-15; Austrich Dep. Tr. at 109-110; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 104.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
42. Ms. Giuffre resumed her relationship with convicted felon Anthony Figueroa. In
spring 2001, while living with Austrich, Ms. Giuffre lied to and cheated on him with her
high school boyfriend, Anthony Figueroa. Ms. Giuffre and Austrich thereafter broke up,
and Figueroa moved into the Bent Oak apartment with Ms. Giuffre. When Austrich
returned to the Bent Oak apartment to check on his pets and retrieve his belongings,
Figueroa in Ms. Giuffre's presence punched Austrich in the face. Figueroa and Ms.
Giuffre fled the scene before police arrived. Figueroa was then a convicted felon and a
drug abuser on probation for possession of a controlled substance.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
40


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page41 of 66
This entire statement is wholly irrelevant to the case being tried, and is improperly being
inserted to tarnish the record. Ms. Giuffre's dating history as a young teen bears no relation to
the allegations made within Ms. Giuffre's complaint against Defendant. As previously stated,
Defendant is attempting to muddy the record with nonsensical teen drama in an effort to detract
from her salacious sexual abuse of a minor child. Such statements bear no relation to the issues
presented through her motion for summary judgment, and should be given weight reflecting the
same. As specifically set forth in Ms. Giuffre's objections to designated testimony, the alleged
information would be excluded by multiple rules of evidence, and contested by Ms. Giuffre. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Virginia Dep. Tr., passim. Moreover, it was the Defendant who
solicited Anthony Figueroa to recruit high school aged girls for Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 4 Figueroa Tr. at 200 and 228-229.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
43.
Ms. Giuffre freely and voluntarily contacted the police to come to her aid in 2001
and 2002 but never reported to them that she was Epstein's "sex slave." In August
2001 at age 17, while living in the same apartment, Mis. Giuffre and Figueroa hosted a
party with a number of guests. During the party, according to Ms. Giuffre, someone
entered Ms. Giuffre's room and stole $500 from her shirt pocket. Ms. Giuffre contacted
the police. She met and spoke with police officers regarding the incident and filed a
report. She did not disclose to the officer that she was a "sex slave." A second time, in
June 2002, Ms. Giuffre contacted the police to report that her former landlord had left her
belongings by the roadside and had lit her mattress on fire. Again, Ms. Giuffre met and
spoke with the law enforcement officers but did not complain that she was the victim of
any sexual trafficking or abuse or that she was then being held as a "sex slave."
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
This statement is misleading in several respects and irrelevant. The fact that Ms. Giuffre
did contact police on two occasions for two specific purposes and did not take that opportunity to
also inform the police of everything else that was going on in her life at the time is immaterial.
Defendant implies that anytime someone calls the police for one thing they should tell the police
41


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page42 of 66
about every other crime regardless of the relevance to the crime to which the police responded
and regardless to the threat to herself should she report on these powerful people. Moreover, as
Professor Coonan explained:
Popular understandings of the term "sex slave" might still connote images of violent
pimps, white slavery, or of victims chained to a bed in a brothel in the minds of some
people. To call Ms. Giuffre a victim of sex trafficking would however very accurately
convey the reality that she along with a great many other victims of contemporary forms
of slavery are often exploited by the "invisible chains" of fraud and psychological
coercion.
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 23, Coonan Expert Report at 20. Ms. Giuffre specifically testified
that she was fearful of Defendant and Epstein, and, accordingly, she would not have reporter her
abusers. She also knew that Epstein had control over the Palm Beach Police. See McCawley Dec.
at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 240:3-241:2.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
44.
From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein and Maxwell were almost entirely
absent from Florida on documented travel unaccompanied by Ms. Giuffre. Flight
logs maintained by Epstein's private pilot Dave Rodgers evidence the substantial number
of trips away from Florida that Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Ms.
Giuffre, between August 2001 and September 2002. Rodgers maintained a log of all
flights on which Epstein and Maxwell traveled with him. Epstein additionally traveled
with another pilot who did not keep such logs and he also occasionally traveled via
commercial flights. For substantially all of thirteen months of the twenty-two months
(trom November 2000 until September 2002) that Ms. Giuffre lived in Palm Beach and
knew Epstein, Epstein was traveling outside of Florida unaccompanied by Ms. Giuffre.
During this same period of time, Ms. Giuffre was employed at various jobs, enrolled in
school, and living with her boyfriend.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
The flight logs produced in this matter provide substantive evidence of Ms. Giuffre's
travel while in the control of Defendant and Epstein, but are clearly incomplete. Moreover, Ms.
Giuffre also was flown by Defendant on commercial flights. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5,
Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 155:5-11. Ms. Giuffre disputes Defendant's statement to the contrary, as
reliance upon incomplete records to prove that Ms. Giuffre was not in fact in the presence of
42


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page43 of 66
Defendant and Epstein is insufficient. Ms. Giuffre incorporates additional details contained in
Response #38 and #46 herein.
Ms. Giuffre's obvious gap in her school records, her presence verified by Epstein's pilot
on flight logs, and witness testimony, corroborate her story that she was traveling with Defendant
and Epstein. In fact, flight logs and pilot testimony clearly prove that Ms. Giuffre was flying
domestic and internationally with Epstein at least 32 times between 12/11/00-07/28/01 and
06/21/02-08/21/02 (Defendant traveling with Ms. Giuffre on 23 of the flights).
As Defendant acknowledges in her own statement #44, flight records are incomplete.
There were several pilots and co-pilots that flew Epstein and Maxwell (Lawrence "Larry"
Visoski, David (Dave) Rodgers, Bill Hammond, Pete Rathgeb, Gary Roxburgh, and Bill
Murphy) in multiple aircrafts (JEGE, Inc. Aircraft # N908JE - Type B-727-31, and Hyperion
Air, Inc. Aircraft # N909JE - Type G-1159B). Yet, only one pilot, David Rodger's produced
flight records. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 41, David Rodger's Flight Log,
GIUFFRE007055- GIUFFRE007161. In addition, many of the girls recruited by Defendant
routinely traveled on commercial flights for the purposes of providing massages to Epstein or
guests at Epstein's New York, New Mexico, or U.S. Virgin Island homes. See McCawley Dec.
at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 27.
As thoroughly depicted below, Ms. Giuffre's passport application, travel records and
witness testimony clearly demonstrate flight logs are incomplete because only one pilot kept a
log, and Ms. Giuffre also flew commercially while she worked for Defendant and Epstein. For
example, on December 11, 2000, while underage, Ms. Giuffre appears on Rodger's flight log
(flight #1433) traveling with Epstein, Maxwell and Emmy Taylor from PBI (Palm Beach, FL) to
TEB (Teterboro, NJ) then on December 14, 2001 (#1434) continues traveling with Epstein and
43


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page44 of 66
Maxwell to TIST (U.S. Virgin Islands); however, there is no flight records of Ms. Giuffre's
return to Palm Beach. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 15, see McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 41,
Rodger's Dep. Ex. 1 at GIUFFRE007095; see also Rodger's Dep. Tr. 96-98 ("Q: And do you
know how Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Adam Perry Lang, and Virginia get off of St.
Thomas or leave the island? A: No. I do not. Probably a charter, I'm guessing.").

On January 12, 2001, at Defendant's directive, Ms. Giuffre applied for a Passport to
travel with them internationally. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 37, GIUFFRE004721, passport
application listing travel plans to London; flight logs subsequently lists Ms. Giuffre traveling to
London with Defendant, Epstein and others).
On January 26, 2001, while underage, Ms. Giuffre appears on Rodger's flight log (flight
#1444) traveling with Epstein, Maxwell and Emmy Taylor from TEB (Teterboro, NJ) to PBI
(Palm Beach, FL); however, there is no flight record indicating how Ms. Giuffre got to New

On March 5, 2001 Ms. Giuffre, Maxwell, Epstein, Emmy Taylor traveled together
internationally (flight #1464) leaving PBI (West Palm Beach) to CYJT (Stephenville, Canada);
then on March 6, 2001 (#1465) they continued on to LFPB (Paris, France) with a layover for
three days. On March 8, 2001, other passengers, including one unidentified female, joined them
on flights # 1466-1467 (from LFPB (Paris, France) - LGGR (Granada, Spain) eventually landing
in EGGW (London, England) on March 11, 2001, where she was then introduced to and lent out

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page47 of 66
A few glaring examples of how Ms. Giuffre's travel records are incomplete is that Ms.
Giuffre traveled from ADS (Addison, Texas) on May 3, 2001 (#1501) to SAT (San Antonio,
Texas); then departs SAT (San Antonio, Texas) on May 5, 2001 (#1502) to PBF (Pine Bluff,
AR) but there is no record produced that explains how Ms. Giuffre arrived in Addison, Texas or
how she returned to Palm Beach from Pine Bluff, AR. Although Epstein's plane appears to have
to originated from Palm Beach on April 23, 2001, Ms. Giuffre's name doesn't not appear on the
log. See Rodger's Dep. Ex. 1 at GIUFFRE007099; Rodger's Dep. Tr. at 130-132 ("Q: Do you
know how Virginia Roberts got to Addison, Texas? A: No. ... Q: Went to Addison and picked
up Virginia Roberts? A: It looks like it.").
Another prime example of how incomplete Ms. Giuffre's travel records are is on on May
14, 2001. While Ms. Giuffre appears on flight #1506 with Epstein, Maxwell, Emmy Taylor and
others (including one unidentified female) from TIST (U.S. Virgin Islands) to TEB (Teterboro,
NJ, there is no record produced explaining how Ms. Giuffre arrived to the U.S. Virgin Islands or
where she stayed when she landed in New York. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 15, Rodger's
Dep. Ex. 1 at GIUFFRE007100; Rodger's Dep. Tr. at 132-133 ("Q: What were the other possible
avenues back in those days for Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell to travel to the Virgin
Islands? A: They could have done a charter, possibly.") (Id. at 134-135 "Q: All right. So at some
point in time, between May 7th and May 14th - A: Uh-huh. Q: -- somebody flies the Gulfstream

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page51 of 66
From September 29, 2002 through October 19, 2002, Defendant and Epstein sent Ms.
Giuffre on a commercial flight to Thailand for massage training and provided her with all
accommodations. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 43, Giuffre007411-Giuffre007432.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
45.
Ms. Giuffre and Figueroa shared a vehicle during 2001 and 2002. Ms. Giuffre and
Figueroa shared a '93 white Pontiac in 2001 and 2002. Ms. Giuffre freely traveled around
the Palm Beach area in that vehicle. In August 2002, Ms. Giuffre acquired a Dodge
Dakota pickup truck from her father. Figueroa used that vehicle in a series of crimes
before and after Ms. Giuffre left for Thailand.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre and Tony Figueroa did not share a vehicle during 2001 and 2002. Instead,
Figueroa borrowed Ms. Giuffre's car while she was traveling with Defendant and Epstein.
Figueroa testified that he "got to take the car, because she was going somewhere else in the
world and did not need it, so..." Figueroa Dep. Tr. At 89-90.
In fact, Ms. Giuffre was frequently traveling with Defendant and Epstein. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 1, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 9-14 (stating that Virginia started traveling on an airplane
with Ghislaine and Jeffrey "not too long" after she started going over to the house). Figueroa
further testified that Virginia "would normally go about two weeks out of every month" with
Epstein. Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 90. He further stated, "Pretty much every time I took her there, it
was always to his mansion. I picked her up one time -- maybe it was a couple of times --from
the jet stream place. But pretty much every single time it was at the hou--- at the mansion." Id.
Moreover, Ms. Giuffre testified she purchased a car from the $10,000 payment she received from
Epstein after she was forced to have sex with Prince Andres in London at Defendant's home
when Ms. Giuffre was a minor. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 120:1-20.
51


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page52 of 66
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
46.
Ms. Giuffre held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002. During 2001 and 2002, Ms.
Giuffre was gainfully employed at several jobs. She worked as a waitress at Mannino's
Restaurant, at TGIFriday's restaurant (aka CCI of Royal Palm Inc.), and at Roadhouse
Grill. She also was employed at Courtyard Animal Hospital (aka Marc Pinkwasser
DVM).
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
This statement is laughable. Ms. Giuffre was hardly gainfully employed during a time
period in which she was trying to escape from the grip Epstein and Maxwell had on Ms. Giuffre.
While Social Security provides that she earned nominal amounts of earning statements for 2001
and 2002, the records do not indicate the month or quarter of the year's work. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 46, GIUFFRE009176. For a brief period, Ms. Giuffre attempted to go back to
school to earn her GED, and tried unsuccessfully to hold down waitressing jobs. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 27, GIUFFRE009179.
For example, in 2001, Ms. Giuffre earned $212.00 as a waitress working "briefly" at
Mannino's Restaurant. (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 472). In 2002, Ms.
Giuffre earned $403.64 at CCI of Royal Palm Beach working there (TGI Fridays) for a "short
time period." (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 473). Then, Ms. Giuffre
worked at Roadhouse grill until about March 2002 earning $1,247.90 (See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 474).

Dec. at Exhibit 47, GIUFFRE007111-GIUFFRE007112.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
47.
In September 2002, Ms. Giuffre traveled to Thailand to receive massage training
and while there, met her future husband and eloped with him. Ms. Giuffre traveled
53


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page54 of 66
to Thailand in September 2002 to receive formal training as a masseuse. Figueroa drove
her to the airport. While there, she initially contacted Figueroa frequently, incurring a
phone bill of $4,000. She met Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and decided to marry
him. She thereafter ceased all contact with Figueroa from October 2002 until two days
before Mr. Figueroa's deposition in this matter in May 2016.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre did travel to Thailand to receive massage training in September 2002.
However, Defendant has inaccurately told only part of the story. Defendant has conveniently left
out certain key facts, which includes the fact that Ms. Giuffre was given an assignment from
Defendant and Epstein that she had to recruit another underage girl from Thailand, and bring that
young girl back to Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 43, GIUFFRE 003191. The
document Ms. Giuffre was give directs her to "call Ms. Maxwell." See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 32, GIUFFRE003191. It is not disputed by Defendant or Epstein, that Ms. Giuffre was
expected to return to Epstein and Maxwell upon completion of her massage training and
assignment. It is undisputed by Ms. Giuffre that she did not return to Defendant and Epstein, but
instead escaped clear across the world to Australia where she remained in hiding from Defendant
and Epstein for several years.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
48.
Detective Recarey's investigation of Epstein failed to uncover any evidence that Ms.
Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or
possession of child pornography. Joseph Recarey served as the lead detective from the
Palm Beach Police Department charged with investigating Jeffrey Epstein. That
investigation commenced in 2005. Recarey worked only on the Epstein case for an entire
year. He reviewed previous officers' reports and interviews, conducted numerous
interviews of witnesses and alleged victims himself, reviewed surveillance footage of the
Epstein home, participated in and had knowledge of the search warrant executed on the
Epstein home, and testified regarding the case before the Florida state grand jury against
Epstein. Detective Recarey's investigation revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein
victims ever mentioned Ms. Maxwell's name and she was never considered a suspect by
the government. None of Epstein's alleged victims said they had seen Ms. Maxwell at
Epstein's house, nor said they had been "recruited by her," nor paid any money by her,
nor told what to wear or how to act by her. Indeed, none of Epstein's alleged victims ever
reported to the government they had met or spoken to Ms. Maxwell. Maxwell was not
54


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66
seen coming or going from the house during the law enforcement surveillance of
Epstein's home. The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell and her name was
never mentioned before the grand jury. No property belonging to Maxwell, including
"sex toys" or "child pornography," was seized from Epstein's home during execution of
these go waran. bout Give in My, when asked dating conti replied,
don't." He confirmed he has no knowledge about Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking
anybody. Detective Recarey also has no knowledge of Ms. Giuffre's conduct that is
subject of this lawsuit.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
This statement is false. Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal
sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his
calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10. Detective Recarey
concluded that Defendant's role was to procure girls for Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit
13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 29:16-29:20. In the execution of the search warrant, stationary was
found in the home bearing Maxwell's name, and notes were written by house staff to Maxwell.
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 45:13-25; Id. at 83:3-83:15; see also
Message Pads, GIUFFRE 001412, 001418, 001435, 001446, 001449, 001453, 001454. A key
piece of evidence in the investigation were message pads uncovered in trash pulls, and from
inside the residence during the search warrant. Those message pads revealed numerous calls left
at the house for Maxwell, indicating she was staying in the house during the days when Epstein
was engaging in illegal sex acts with minors.
Additionally, a walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant
revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell
naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to
Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1,
55


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page56 of 66
19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez
Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4.
Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily
sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were
giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1-
306:24. Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been
sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13,
Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15. Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by
Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19,
Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22.
The record is replete with testimony demonstrating that Maxwell recruited Virginia, and
recruited other females, who in turn recruited other females, all who were sexually abuse by
Epstein; meaning, it is undisputed that Maxwell started the top of the pyramid of local Palm
Beach girls who were all eventually identified as victims. See, e.g., McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1,
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 34:19-35:3; 98:5-98:12; 104:15-104:23. The co-conspirator who maintained
direct contact with the many underage victims was Sarah Kellen, whose sole responsibility was
to schedule underage girls to visit Epstein for sex. Sarah reported directly to Maxwell. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 26:10-26:20. On the day when the search
warrant was executed, the house maid, Ruboyo was scheduled to report to the house that day at 8
am; however, she received a call from Maxwell telling her not to go. See McCawley Dec. at
Exhibit 20, Rabuyo Dep. Tr. at 81:20-82:25. Maxwell orchestrated and ran the entire sex
56

trafficking scheme from a high level, and insulated herself from most of the underage girls who
were being paid for sex.
Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested
that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he
brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep.
Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21. Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was "the boss"
and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez
Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
49.
No nude photograph of Ms. Giuffre was displayed in Epstein's home. Epstein's
housekeeper, Juan Alessi, "never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr.
Epstein's house." Detective Recarey entered Epstein's home in 2002 to install security
cameras to catch a thief and did not observe any "child pornography" within the home,
including on Epstein's desk in his office.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
This is false. Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein's home.
Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer.
Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24. He also testified to there being a collage of nude
photos in Epstein's closet. Id. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence
by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit
13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24. And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or
US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7.
Numerous other people have testified about nude photographs being on display in the
home including Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was
reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit
14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20. Additionally, the search warrant video, taken at a time when
57


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page58 of 66
the house had already been sanitized, revealed photographs of nudity displayed, including a
photograph of Maxwell herself in the nude. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 44, Search Warrant
Video attached to the Deposition of Recarey.
Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific
purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at
150. Finally, Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
50.
Ms. Giuffre intentionally destroyed her "journal" and "dream journal" regarding
her "memories" of this case in 2013 while represented by counsel. Ms. Giuffre
drafted a "journal" describing individuals to whom she claims she was sexually trafficked
as well as her memories and thoughts about her experiences with Epstein. In 2013, she
and her husband created a bonfire in her backyard in Florida and burned the journal
together with other documents in her possession. Id. Ms. Giuffre also kept a "dream
journal" regarding her thoughts and memories that she possessed in January 2016. To
date, Ms. Giuffre cannot locate the "dream journal."
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
The dream journal contained memories of Ms. Giuffre's dreams. While Ms. Giuffre has
looked for this journal, which is wholly irrelevant to this case, she has been unable to locate it.
Ms. Giuffre also wrote in a personal journal some of her experiences with Maxwell and Epstein,
which were harmful and painful. In an effort to relieve herself of those past painful experiences,
Ms. Giuffre followed the advice of a therapist, and burned the journal as a form of cathartic
release at a time when she was under no obligation to maintain the personal memorialization of
personal and painful experiences. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 205:13-
206:10.
58


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page59 of 66
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
51.
Ms. Giuffre publicly peddled her story beginning in 2011. Ms. Giuffre granted
journalist Sharon Churcher extensive interviews that resulted in seven (7) widely
distributed articles from March 2011 through January 2015. Churcher regularly
communicated with Ms. Giuffre and her "attorneys or other agents" from "early 2011" to
"the present day." Ms. Giuffre received approximately $160,000 for her stories and
pictures that were published by many news organizations.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Defendant's statement misrepresents history. In 2011, Ms. Giuffre was still in hiding
from Epstein and Maxwell in Australia. Ms. Giuffre was not looking to sell anything or even
speak with anyone about what had happened to her in her previous life from which she
dramatically escaped. Journalist, Sharon Churcher, located Ms. Giuffre and impressed the
importance of Ms. Giuffre standing up to those who had harmed her and speak with Federal
authorities, which Ms. Giuffre did in 2011. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31, Redacted 302
GIUFFRE001235-01246.
In addition, Churcher impressed the importance of bringing the abuse of Defendant and
Epstein to public light to prevent their continued abuse of others. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit
35, Giuffre003690. After much deliberation, Ms. Giuffre agreed to be interviewed by Churcher,
and was compensated for sharing her story, which came at a heavy price of being publicly
scrutinized.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
52.
Ms. Giuffre drafted a 144-page purportedly autobiographical book manuscript in
2011 which she actively sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous with her
Churcher interviews, Ms. Giuffre drafted a book manuscript which purported to
document Ms. Giuffre's experiences as a teenager in Florida, including her interactions
with Epstein and Maxwell. Ms. Giuffre communicated with literary agents, ghost writers
and potential independent publishers in an effort to get her book published. She
generated marketing materials and circulated those along with book chapters to numerous
individuals associated with publishing and the media.
59


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page60 of 66
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Defendant's characterization of these activities are out of context and thus misleading. In
2008, Ms. Giuffre received a Victim Notification Letter from the United States Attorney's office
for the Southern District of Florida, see McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE0010202,
regarding her sexual victimization by Epstein. Thereafter, in 2011, she sought psychological
counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she endured. Also that year, journalist Sharon
Churcher sought her out, and traveled half way around the globe to interview her on painful
subjects. Ms. Giuffre was interviewed by the FBI in 2011. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31,
FBI Redacted 302 GIUFFRE01235-1246. She was also getting psychological help. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 38, Lightfoot Records, GIUFFRE005431-005438. In that situation,
Ms. Giuffre began to draft a fictionalized account of what happened to her. It was against this
backdrop of her trauma being unearthed, her steps to seek psychological counseling for it, that
she drafted this manuscript. Doing so was an act of empowerment and a way of reframing and
taking control over the narrative of her past abuse that haunts her.
"Writing 'I' has been an emancipatory project for women." Perreault, Jeanne,
"AUTOGRAPHY/ TRANSFORMATION/ ASYMMETRY," Women, Autobiography, Theory A Reader
edited by Sidonie Smith & Julia Watson. Indeed, scholars have written that the act of engaging in
autobiography or even accounts loosely based on autobiography, is a process of taking control of
one's own narrative and one's own self: "Thus a specific recitation of identity involves the
inclusion of certain identity contents and the exclusion of others; the incorporation of certain
narrative itineraries and internationalities, the silencing of others; the adoption of certain
autobiographical voices, the muting of others." Smith, Sidonie, PERFORMATIVITY,

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PRACTICE, RESISTANCE, Women, Autobiography, Theory A Reader edited by
Sidonie Smith & Julia Watson.
Indeed, even a cursory look at the manuscript penned by Ms. Giuffre informs the reader
that she is trying to put forth a more palatable and more empowering narrative to over-write that
powerlessness she felt when being abused by Defendant and Epstein. While Ms. Giuffre
explored trying to publish her story to empower other individuals who were subject to abuse, she
ultimately decided not to publish it. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. 249:16-
18; 250:19-251:3.
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
53.
Ms. Giuffre's publicly filed "lurid" CVRA pleadings initiated a media frenzy and
generated highly publicized litigation between her lawyers and Alan Dershowitz. On
December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre, through counsel, publicly filed a joinder motion that
contained her "lurid allegations" about Ms. Maxwell and many others, including Alan
Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, Jean-Luc Brunel. The joinder motion was followed by a
"corrected" motion and two further declarations in January and February 2015, which
repeated many of Ms. Giuffre's claims. These CVRA pleadings generated a media
maelstrom and spawned highly publicized litigation between Ms. Giuffre's lawyers,
Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz. After Ms. Giuffre publicly alleged Mr.
Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz vigorously defended himself in the
media. He called Ms. Giuffre a liar and accused her lawyers of unethical conduct. In
response, attorneys Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz who counterclaimed. This
litigation, in turn, caused additional media attention by national and international media
organizations.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
See Ms. Giuffre's Paragraph 7, supra, explaining why the allegations were necessary and
appropriate for multiple reasons. Ms. Giuffre disputes Defendant's false characterization of these
events, and, indeed, the media attention was caused by Defendant's is suing her defamatory press
release.
61


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page62 of 66
DEFENDANT'S PURPORTED FACTS
54.
Ms. Giuffre formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to attract publicity and speak
out on a public controversy. In 2014, Ms. Giuffre, with the assistance of the same
counsel, formed a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to Ms.
Giuffre, the purpose of the organization is to promote Ms. Giuffre's professed cause
against sex slavery. The stated goal of her organization is to help survivors surmount the
shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse. Ms.
Giuffre attempts to promote Victims Refuse Silence at every opportunity. For example,
Ms. Giuffre participated in an interview in New York with ABC to promote the charity
and to get her mission out to the public.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT'S FACTS
Ms. Giuffre did not form the non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to "speak out on a public
controversy," but instead to simply help survivors of sexual abuse and sexual trafficking. In
order to provide assistance to victims, Ms. Giuffre attempted to talk about the non-profit's
mission when she had the opportunity to do so. See www.victimsrefusesilece.org.
MS. GIUFFRE'S STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS
55.
Virginia Roberts was born August 9, 1983. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 51,

In 2000, Virginia's father Sky Roberts worked at the Mar-a-Lago. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 72, 74.
58.
Sky Roberts got Virginia a job at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, either months before or
just after Virginia's 17th birthday. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at
72, 74; Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 25:19-25:21; 28:10-28:12.

Virginia worked at Mar-a-Lago as a spa bathroom attendant. See McCawley Dec.
at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 61:9-61:24; Austrich Dep. Tr. at 100:3-12.
61.
Virginia was not a masseuse at Mar-a-Lago as she had no massage experience.
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21; 116:19-117:12; Austrich
Dep. Tr. at 34-35, 100-101, 127-128; Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 82:10-15; 168:24-169:1; Sky Roberts
Dep. Tr. at 80:7-19; 84:18 -85:1.
62. l
Maxwell approached Virginia at Mar-a-Lago, and recruited her to come to Jeffrey
Epstein's house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, 5, and 17, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21;
116:19-117:12; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 94:24-95:2; Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 80:7-19; 84:18 -85:1.
At the time Maxwell recruited Virginia to Jeffrey Epstein's house, Virginia was
either 16 or 17 years old, depending on whether this occurred just before or just after Virginia's
birthday. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 49, MAR-A-LAGO 0173, 0176.
64. Virginia followed Maxwell's instructions and reported to Jeffrey Epstein's house
on the night of the day when Maxwell approached Virginia at Mar-a-Lago. See McCawley Dec.
at Exhibits 5 and 18, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 117:20-118:1; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 96-98;
GIUFFRE000102-103 at p. 48-49.
65.
Maxwell told Virginia at Mar-a-Lago that Virginia could get paid for giving a
massage to Jeffrey Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21;
116:19-117:12.
66.
When Virginia arrived at Epstein's house, she was taken upstairs to Epstein's
bedroom, and instructed by Maxwell and Epstein how to give Epstein a massage. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 198:20-199:3; 199:15-199:18; Epstein Dep. Tr. at 74:3-14.
63


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page64 of 66
67.
Epstein and Maxwell turned the massage into a sexual encounter. See McCawley
Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 198:20-199:3; 199:15-199:18.
68.
Virginia was not a professional masseuse, and was not old enough to be a
masseuse in Florida even though Maxwell testified she only hired professional masseuses. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 61:9-61:24, 111:12-111:21, 116:19-117:12; Fla.
Stat. § 480.041; Maxwell Dep. Tr. at 23:21-24:9; 31:6-18; 41:7-13; 220:13-221:2; 225:23-
226:20; 248:5-16; 310:6-17; 383:2-18.
69.
Maxwell and Epstein promised Virginia money and a better life in exchange for
complying with their sexual demands. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at
198:20-199:3; 199:15-199:18.
70. Maxwell had sex with Virginia and other females. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit
5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 138:17-139:16; Maxwell 07-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 86:25-87:9; 91:15-91:21.
71. Virginia was trafficked nationally and internationally for sexual purposes. See
McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 5, 1, 41? GIUFFRE007055-007161 (Flight Logs); Giuffre Dep. Tr.
at 193:22-194:16; 201:24; 204:24:205:5; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 104:9-104:14; Andrew Photo
GIUFFRE007167; Spain Photo GIUFFRE007166.
72.
Maxwell recruited other non-professionals under the guise of being a masseuse,
but in reality only recruited girls for sexual purposes. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 5, 16, 4, 1,
18 Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 198:20-199:3; Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 13-15; Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 88:12-22;
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 34; GIUFFRE000105 at 57-58; GIUFFRE000241-242 at p. 212-213.
73.
Maxwell was the boss of others whose job it was to recruit minor females for
Epstein for sex, such as Sarah Kellen. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at
26:10-26:20.
64

74.
Maxwell was a recruiter of underage girls and other young females for Epstein for
sex, and was the boss in charge of those females. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 16, 4, 21, and

e. Okay. When you started with Jeffrey
Epstein, what were your job duties?
A. I was doing maintenance. I was doing
building and rebuilding and maintenance work
basically. Because he just bought the house at that
time. And because of Mr. Wechsler knowing me, they
recommend me to go to the house and take a look at
the house. And we start tearing the house down,
basically, at the beginning of my job.

what was your job?

Occasionally, I'll need to object for the
record in case we need to have a discussion
about this with the judge. And so that's just
me preserving those objections.
THE WITNESS: Yes, he had a girlfriend.
Her name was Dr. Andersson, Eva Andersson. And
she was there just for a few months after I
came to the house.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. And how was your relationship with
Dr. Andersson?
A. Fine.
Q. Okay. And at the time when Mr. Epstein
was -- at the time when Dr. Andersson was Jeffrey
Epstein's girlfriend, did you see any other female
companions around the house?
A.
Eventually -- they have a lot of guests,
too. They did have guests coming in. But I can't
remember exactly who.
It's a socialite. So they
have friends.
Q.
At the time when Dr. Andersson was
Mr. Epstein's girlfriend, was Mr. Epstein getting
massages?

Who was your direct supervisor?

Mr. Epstein. He would deal with me
directly, or if he was not available, Ms. Maxwell.
Q. okay. I want you to go to Exhibit 3 and

A. Line 8, "QUESTION: And then Maxwell came
and she took over you as your immediate supervisor?
Yes. That's correct. Yes. She became
the supervisor not only for this house, but for all
the homes.
Q. Okay. So your immediate supervisor was
Ms. Maxwell?
A.
Ms. Maxwell. But if Mr. Epstein was at
the house, I would never go to Ms. Maxwell; I would
go to him directly, or he would come to me.

Ms. Maxwell?

of time while Ms. Maxwell was at the house, do you
have an approximation as to the number of different
females -- females that you were told were massage

that.

question that I was looking to ask, so let me go

Did you go out looking for the girls --

-- as the massage therapists?
Never.
Who did?
A.
Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Epstein and their
friends, because their friends relayed to other
friends they knew a massage therapist and they would
send to the house. So it was referrals.

Hold on. That misstates what is
happening in this deposition, because the word
"recruit" was introduced by the lawyers in this
deposition. So I object to your
characterization of the testimony.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. I'll read for you the question and the
answer.
The question was: "QUESTION: When did
that role get transferred from you to Ms. Maxwell,
the role of looking after girls or calling the
girls?
"ANSWER: I didn't look after -- out for
girls. Ms. Maxwell was the one that recruit. I
remember one occasion or two occasions she would say
to me, John, give me a list of all the spas in Palm
Beach County, and I will drive her from one to the
other to PGA in Boca; and she would go in and drop
credit cards -- not credit cards but business cards,
and she would come out. And then we'd go to -- she
will recruit the girls. Was never, never done by me
or Mr. Epstein or anyone else that I know of."
Is that truthful testimony?
A. It is truthful; however, I think

"recruiting," for myself, for my point of view, is
hiring immediately and recruit the person.
I think she was looking for massage
therapists. She was looking for the best kind. She
went - and you're right, I went one time with her,
or twice maybe, to different spas and different
clubs, great clubs, I mean, in Boca, in Fort
Lauderdale, in -- in Palm Beach. She was looking
for the best massage therapists available.
How she find these girls, I don't know. I
just drove there. I just was the driver. I never
was involved with any of the offerings or
negotiations or meeting these girls. Never.
Q. Okay. Ms. Maxwell was the one that would
meet the girls?
A. Yeah.
okay. Did you ever check any of the IDs
for any of these girls?
A. I was not -- that was not in my everyday
things to do. It was not.
Q.
That was just not part of your job?
A.
That was not my job.
Did Ms. Maxwell take photographs while she
was at the Palm Beach house?

Q. How did you know that the sex toys were
kept in Ms. Maxwell's closet?
A.
Because I know where everything was in
that house.
Every single room, every single thing,
it was a place, it was placed by me, by the cleaning
lady or my wife. l
Every -- everything that happened
in that house, I knew it.
Who showed you where the dildo or sex toys

THE WITNESS: Nobody. Nobody show me.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. You just saw it?
A.
I saw it.
Q. So you knew where to put it back?
A. Yeah. We had to open the closet, clean
the closet, put the clothes in place, put the shoes
in place, put everything in place. So it was a
matter of tidying things up.
Q. Did you ever find any costumes?
A. I saw one shiny black costume, but I
didn't even know --

A.
The same place.
In Ms. Maxwell's closet?

Yes.
And where was

terminated from her employment in 2000.
My question to you is: Do you remember
what time of year or what month it would have been,
whether spring, summer, fall, winter; January,
February, December?
A. Of what year?
Q. Of 2000, that you would have gone to the

year that you went to Mar-a-Lago?
A.
Yes.
Okay. What year do you believe that you
went to the Mar-a-Lago to pick Virginia up?
A.
I think it was 2000 and -- I think it was
the summer of 2002.

Summer, because I remember that day that I

A.
2001.
Q.
June, July, 2001, that's when you believe
that it was?
A. Yes.

Okay. And do you remember the month -
A. No, sorry. Sorry. Not 2001. We left in
December 31st. It was 2000 -- the last year that I
was working for Jeffrey, when I met Virginia.

today -
A.
It was 2002.

Virginia. She spoke to her maybe five minutes.

A. And she came to the car, and we went home.
In the afternoon, about 4:00 or 5:00 in the
afternoon, the same day, Virginia came to the house.
Q. Who brought her to the house?
A. I don't know. She came to the back door,
I remember. And she was dressed differently. She
came to the house.
Q. When you first arrived to the Mar-a-Lago
with -- are you driving the car and Ms. Maxwell is
in the passenger seat?
A.
Yes.
And could you see Virginia Roberts from
the car?
A.
Yes.
Q.
Where was she sitting or standing? How
far away from the car?

was parked this way, and I would see her with
Ms. Maxwell, talking.
Q. Did you --
A. I could not hear what they were saying,
but I did see it.
2. Did you park the car or did you stop right
there and --
A. I parked the car because we are not
allowed to go into Mar-a-Lago.
Q. Okay. Let me finish my question.
Did you park the car in a parking space in
the parking lot or did you just stop on the side of
the road and Ms. Maxwell got out?
A. Mar-a-Lago has a -- has a long wide
driveway, and on the right of the driveway is -- is
the parking spots like this or something. And I
parked in one of those spaces. And waiting for her,
I think it was over an hour that I wait for her.
Okay.
So did you watch her first talk
to --
A.
No. At the end. Right at the end,
before -- when she was leaving.
So Ms. Maxwell gets out of the car. And

No. No.
Q. So after you wait an hour, Ms. Maxwell is
coming out?
A. And then she saw Virginia and she
stopped -- she went to her, she talked to her, she
came back to the car.
Q. And prior to that day, you had never seen
Virginia at the house?
A. Never. Never.
Q. Okay. Did Ms. Maxwell tell you that
Virginia's father worked at the Mar-a-Lago?
A. I don't think so. I think it was -- I
think we find out later, after the -- she says, My
father works -- I think it was from Virginia, that
she says her father works at Mar-a-Lago.
It is information from her. I don't think
it was Ms. Maxwell that told me anything. She don't
have to -- she don't have to talk to me. I mean,
Ms. Maxwell will not go and talk to me about this --
these people's family. I don't know. She never
did.
Q.
Okay. I only have to go by what I have.

home. I don't know. I can't remember.
After that day, do you recall that she
started coming to the house more frequently?
A.
Yes, she did.
Q. In fact, did she start coming to the house
approximately three times a week?
A.
Yes, probably.
And at times, would you go pick her up?
A.
Yes. This happened maybe twice, three
times.
And at times, would you take her home?
Yes.
Q.
And did there come a point in time where
Virginia starting bringing other girls with her?
MR. PAGLIUSCA: Object to form and

before we left. I saw her bringing some
friends with her to the house. And I cannot
remember how many times, but I was at the end
of our stay.

it was too long after that.

Q. Would you drive her to the airport with
them?
A.
Occasionally, I think so, yes. I would
drive everybody to the airport. My wife would drive

Yes.

Q. Interesting buildings?
A. No. She -- she liked -- she had a dog,
and she took a lot of photographs of her dog. And
us. And she took photographs of the cars and the
house. Everything inside. She had an album full of
photographs of people, young girls, girls. And I
remember that she had. Like a hobby.
Q. Right.
You never saw any pictures that were very
upsetting to you, though, correct?
A. NO. No.

sort of -- would you describe them as being artistic
kind of pictures?
MR. EDWARDS: Objection, counsel

they were pornographic. I don't think it was
any vaginal or things, you know, female parts
showing. It was some girls were topless,
taking the sun. It was a beautiful house, it
was a beautiful setting, so she took a lot of

A
Yes.
Was it is a franchise, if you know?
A
I know
when I first started there, they were
corporate, but then they were a franchise. They were
bought out. But I'm not sure if when I got there they
were a franchise or not.
Got it.
Do you know if Ms. Roberts had any previous
employment before she worked at Taco Bell?
I think by the apartment,
she worked for KFC for
a little while.
MS. MENNINGER: Are you looking at Ms.
Roberts?
THE WITNESS: I'm thinking. I can't
remember. I remember something with KFC. They
had one really close to us. I think she worked
there for a tiny, tiny bit. I'm not sure.
MS. MENNINGER: Okay.
BY MS. MENNINGER:
Before the Taco Bell?
A
Or she could've applied there. It's just in my
head.
She might have just applied there, and didn't get
it, and that's why I brought her to Taco Bell.
Okay.
Because we were both the night managers.

Do you know about what years this was?
A
Not really.
Q
Do you know about how old you were?
A
when, what?
@ I'm just focused on the period of time in which
you were living at her parent's house in the trailer.
A
I was probably 18 when we moved in there.
And you said you were only there for a couple of
months?
A
Not that I remember. Like, it might have been a
little longer. I'm not sure.
Were you engaged to Ms. Roberts?
A
Yes.
When did you become engaged to her?
A
When we were living in Oakland Park.
Tell me about the engagement. How did it come
about?
A
Well, we fell in love, and -- I believe it was
Valentine's Day when I proposed.
A
A
Did you have a ring?
Yes.
Did she accept?
Yes.
How long were you engaged?

Yes -- well, for a while. I mean, I know at the
end, I wasn't working anywhere.
Why weren't you working?
A
I don't remember the exact reason.
Had you quit?
A
I believe so. I know the pet store let me go
for walking on to the other side talking to somebody. But
I don't remember why I left Dunkin' Donuts.
Do you believe that you were fired from Dunkin'
Donuts?
A
No. That pet store was the only time anybody
ever fired me.
That will stick in your brain.
Yeah.
At the time that you left the pet store, was
Ms. Roberts still working there?
A
Yes.
And how long do you recall her working there?
A
Not long.
I hate to do this to you, but what does "not
long" mean to you, weeks, months, days?
A
Over a month. That's really all I can say.
Maybe over a month before she went to work at the
Mar-a-Lago or Donald Trump's country club.
Did she leave the pet store to go work at

Did you know her friend by the name of Tony
Figueroa?
A
Somewhat.
Tell me what you remember about Tony Figueroa.
A
Other than him being an idiot, not much.
Did you have any interactions with Mr. Figueroa?
A
Very little.
When do you recall seeing him, like, in what
city, I mean?
A
Up in West Palm Beach.
Did he come over to your apartment?
A
I believe so.
Did you believe them to be having a
relationship?
A
At the very end when I left, yes.
was that one of the reasons for your leaving?
A
One of them.
What were the others?
A
Well, after I found out about that, that's when
I heard about all the other stuff that was happening.
What did you hear about all the other stuff?
A
Well, I mean, after she went to work for
Mar-a-Lago then she was, I guess, recruited to go work for
Jeff something. I don't remember his last name.

Is that what she told you "she was recruited"?
A
Yeah. Well, she didn't use those words. But I
don't know why else anybody would take -- like, they hired
her over there as a massage therapist, but she didn't have
any experience.
At Mar-a-Lago --
A
At Mar-a-Lago, yes. Then all of a sudden one
day, she was working for Jeff, whatever his name was.
Let me just take a step back. You found out
towards the end of your relationship with Ms. Roberts that
she was then having a relationship with Mr. Figueroa. Is
that right?
A
I don't know if it was a relationship. But,
yes.
Enough to cause you to think you didn't want to
be engaged anymore?
A l
Yes.
Did you and Ms. Roberts have a fight at that
time?
A
Yes.

how long we lived there.
Okay. At some point in time, though, while
you're living on her parent's property, it becomes 1999?
A
Yeah, I believe.
Okay. And so when you started living at her
parent's property, you're 18, she's 15, but at some point
in time you turn 19 and she turned 16?
A
Yes.
Okay. And at some other point in time, she
leaves the job at the pet store?
A
Pet store, yeah.
And goes to work at the Mar-a-Lago?
A
Yes. At Donald Trump's country club, yeah.
Okay. Donald Trump's country club is called the
Mar-a-Lago?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection.
THE WITNESS: Yeah, that's what I always
remember it as.
Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Is that right?

But if she had to get clean for her job, she
would have gotten clean for the job.
Okay. Do you remember her being hired as a
bathroom attendant there, a locker room attendant?
A
Now that you're saying that, some kind of
attendant sounds familiar. But I don't really remember.
All I remember is for the massage. As a -- I don't
remember exactly what she got hired for at Donald Trump's
place. But I just remember the masseuse thing.
But as you're saying "the attendant, " the
attendant sounds familiar because I doubt her father would
hire her as a massage therapist without knowing anything.
So you had known her for some period of time
before she gets this job at the Mar-a-Lago, right?
A
Right.
Did she have any massage therapy training
whatsoever?
No.
Ever given a massage to anyone?
A
Not that I remember.
Ever given a massage to you?
A
Not until she was already doing the massage
stuff. But, no, I don't remember any kind of massage
training or even like an inkling for it.
Okay. Then when she goes to work for

Mar-a-Lago, you don't remember, I think is the words you
used, whether she worked there for weeks or months?
A
Yes.
Q
You don't remember?
A
No, not at all.
And at the time when she gets the job at the
Mar-a-Lago, do you remember where you were working, if
anywhere?
A
No. I mean, I think at that time, I was working
at one of the places. But I don't really remember where.
And then, and I believe that you used this word,
correct me if I'm wrong, she's recruited to work for Jeff?
A
Yes.
And do you remember her telling you that it was
an assistant or somebody associated with Jeff that
recruited her to work with Jeff?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading.
THE WITNESS: I don't remember.
MS. MENNINGER: Misstates the testimony.
THE WITNESS: Sorry.
I don't remember. All
I remember was that somebody got her from there to
Jeff.

Then there's months; November, December.
So this is the year 2000, and these are the
A
months?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection to this entire line
of questioning. The witness
has no foundation for
talking about this particular document.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Okay. So do you know how long that -- as you
sit here today, do you remember how long Virginia had been
going over to Jeff's house before she started traveling on
an airplane with him?

THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
It could be months, it could be a year?

think she was there for very long without doing
traveling.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
But in your mind, you can't tell me how long
"very long" is?
A
No, I mean, I don't.
Okay. And is there anything that would tell you
the year or the month in which you remember Virginia first

going over to Jeff's house?
A
Not really.
There's nothing I could really show you in this
world that would remind you right now?
A
No.
Okay. Before going over to work with Jeff, did
Virginia have any massage experience?
A
No.
When -- I think you said with respect to
"bringing other girls, that sounds familiar," what other
girls do you remember her bringing? Do you remember their
names?

I don't remember names.

I don't think so.

house?
A
A few times. Like, I think I went -- I think I
dropped her off and somebody always brought her back. I
don't really remember picking her up too much.
Okay. And in the beginning, she was telling you
that she was performing massages?

that's why I said "recruited" -- that's the only word I

Why do you use the word "recruited"?
A
Because that's the only word -- I don't know,
football or everything. That's the only word I can think
of, you recruit somebody.
Hired her?

Yeah, I guess. It was -- it was just a very

No.
You don't know what she said to that person?

No.

Do you remember her coming home and saying "I
got a job with Jeff"?
A
I remember she said she got a job with Jeff.
Did she tell about that job?
A
I think it was -- I think at the time it was for
massage therapy, like, she was going to be a masseuse.
And she was excited about it?
A
Yeah.
She wasn't sad about it?
A
Not that I remember. But I really don't
remember much from back then.
She wasn't crying when she came home and said "I
just got a job with Jeff, " right?
No.
You're guessing that you - she got the job with
Jeff before you moved into the Bent Oak apartment, but you
don't know. Correct?
MR. EDWARDS:
Form
THE WITNESS:
Yes.
But I would think we
would have had to have had the money by then.
So
that was the only time she was making real good
money.
BY MS. MENNINGER:
And do you know how much that apartment cost?
I know it was expensive.

was just a masseuse, you know. Like I said, he's a

do you need her, you know.

I -- I really don't know. All I know is
he would have Virginia, obviously, go out and look
for other girls, also, to bring back, as well.
And how do you know that?
A
Because she had explained to me that
sometimes when she would go out on trips that her
and Ms. Maxwell and stuff would go out to, like,
clubs and stuff and just try and pick up girls to
bring back, so...
That's what Virginia told you?

Yes.

I thought I muted it.
Did any of your information come from
anywhere other than Virginia?
A
No.
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
A
Like I said, I did not talk -- I did not
really speak to any of them other than, you know,
hi, how's it going and stuff like that, until I had
actually met Jeffrey. And then he was the only one
I ever really spoke with. I had met Ms. Maxwell a
couple of times, but it was never, like, you know,
actual conversations, so...
BY MS. MENNINGER:
All right. Well, let me -- when did you
meet Jeffrey?
I'd probably say -- probably a few months
after I had moved in with her.
Okay. And how did you come to meet
Jeffrey?
A
Dropping her off over at his mansion.
And did you drop her off using her car?
Yes.
And so she just asked you: Can you take
me over there?

A
Yeah.
And did she tell you where to go?
A
Yeah. She told where he lived and
everything. And then obviously I got to take the
car, because she was going somewhere else in the
world and did not need it, so...
You were dropping her off for a multi-day
trip?
Q
A
Yeah. She would normally go about two
weeks out of every month, so...
Iwo weeks straight?
Yeah. It was two weeks home and two weeks
gone, basically.
Did you always take her to his house,

up one time -- maybe it was a couple of times --
from the jet stream place. But pretty much every
single time it was at the hou- -- at the mansion.
(Brief interruption.)
Okay. So you're -- is that your phone?
I'm --
A
No, it is. I thought I muted it.
That's okay.

Where did your first conversation
with Jeffrey take place?

I'm pretty sure it was in the kitchen or
the living room.
Inside the house?
A
Yeah, it was inside the house. I've never
seen him anywhere else other than in the mansion or
getting off the jet.
So you were allowed to go inside the

A
Yeah. But I never went upstairs. I've
only been in the kitchen, the living room, and by
the pool.
How many times would you estimate that you
had been over to the house?
A
I mean, at least once every two weeks to
drop her off, you know.
Was there a period of time between 2001
and when she left in 2002 where she was not working
for Jeffrey?
A
Yes.
What period of time was that?

It was pretty much, like, when she was
actually working as a server. Like, basically
because we were trying to not have her go back
there. Like, she did not want to go back there.
And we were trying to just work without needing his
money, you know.
Q
All right. And if I can re-call up that
Exhibit 2, can you see from here when about she was
working as a server?

March 4th, '02.

I really have no clue.
Okay. How old was Ms. Roberts in 2002, if
you know?
A
I'd probably say, like, 18 or so, maybe.
Q
If her birthday is in '83 --
A
oh, if it's in '83, then I'd say --
because I was born in '82, so a year younger than me
would be...
A
18, 19?
Yeah, somewhere around there.

Q
I guess my question is: Did she ever tell
you that she had started as a regular masseuse for
him and then transitioned to something other than a
masseuse?
A NO. :
She never said that it transitioned.
But she ended up explaining to me what had happened
before, so...
What has -- what is that?
A
That her and Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey would
obviously be doing stuff, all three of them
together. Like I said, that they would all go out
to clubs to pick up girls and try and find them to
bring back for Jeffrey. And then she told me about
how, like I said, her and Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey
were all intimate together on multiple occasions.
A
When did she tell you this?
I'm not exactly sure on the dates.
Was it while you were still together?
A
Yes.
Did you -- had you met Ms. Maxwell?
A
Yeah, I had met her a couple of times.
When did you meet Ms. Maxwell?
A
Dates, I'm unsure of. But it was pretty
much, like I said, at Jeffrey's house in the
kitchen.

Ms. Maxwell, had Ms. Roberts already told you that
she had been intimate?

No.
She had told me about that, I

remember about what Ms. Roberts said about being
intimate with Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein at the
same time.

I remember her talking about, like,
strap-ons and stuff like that. But, I mean, like I
said, all the details are not really that clear.
But I remember her talking about, like, how they
would always be using and stuff like that.
She and Ms. Maxwell and Mr Epstein would
used strap-ons?
A
Uh-huh (affirmative).
How did you feel about that?
A
I just -- obviously not happy about it.

about sex with the Prince?
I -- I don't recall talking to them about
that, but, I mean, it's -- it could be possible.
Other than sex with the Prince, is there
anyone else that Jeffrey wanted Ms. Roberts to have
sex with that she relayed to you?
A
Mainly, like I said, just Ms. Maxwell and
all the other girls.
Ms. Maxwell wanted -- Jeffrey wanted
Virginia to have sex with Ms. Maxwell?
A
And him, yeah.
And did she tell you whether she had ever
done that?

Yeah.
She said that she did.
And when did she tell you that?

girls, or asking me to get girls.

One or two --
The majority of the time it was pretty
much his assistant.
How do you know Ms. Maxwell's voice?

Because she sounds British.
So someone with a British accent called
you once or twice and asked for --
A
well, she told me who she was.
Okay. And what did she say when she
called you and asked you to bring girls?

She just said, "Hi. This is Ghislaine.
Jeffrey was wondering if you had anybody that could
come over."

just so that the record is clear -- well, I'll let
you answer in your words. Just be clear.
What was it that Virginia was trying to
get away from and stop with respect to working at
Jeffrey Epstein's
house?

To stop being used and abused.

Due to all the things that I have come
to -- that have been brought to light, and in the
experiences that I've had, and the conversations
that I have had with her. Like, it just all adds up

she ever express that it was the times of work that
she was trying to get away from?

No.

Nope.
You mentioned that there was -- you had
several conversations with Virginia when she was
discussing them wanting -- or I think the word you
used was force, but later we tried to clarify that,
but them forcing her to have sex with Prince Andrew.
Do you remember that?
A
Yeah.
And that you expressed that you were
worried for her safety if she were to decline that?
A
Yes.
What about your conversation with Virginia
on that particular occasion made you worried for
Virginia's safety?
A
Just the way she was talking to me. Like,
she just sounded scared.
And what -- what -- try to dig back and

saying it, if you could just describe that for us.

you don't.
Do you have any reason to believe that any
of your previous sworn statements that you have made
are not true?
A
No.
MR. EDWARDS: I just object and ask that
if we're going to ask the witness questions about any
of her statements in whole or in part that the
witness be allowed to see the statement, review the
statement and then answer your questions.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) You may answer the
question.
A
Can you reask the question? I'm sorry.
Do you have any reason to believe that any
of your prior sworn statements are untrue?
I have no reason to believe that my prior
statements are untrue.
Has anyone told you to say something that
was not true in connection with this case?
A
No, ma'am.
All right. I'd like to start with a
lawsuit that you filed under the caption Jane Doe
versus Jeffrey Epstein.
Do you recall that lawsuit?
A
I believe so.

(Exhibit 1 marked.)
(BY MS. MENNINGER) I'm going to show you
an exhibit that we are marking as Defendant's
Exhibit 1.
MR. EDWARDS: Can I see that for a second?
I'd just like to make an objection on the
record for the misidentification of this document.
While there was a lawsuit filed under the
style of Jane Doe versus Jeffrey Epstein, Jane Doe
was not Virginia Giuffre. And the lawsuit that's now
being handed to this witness is Jane Doe 102 versus
Jeffrey Epstein.
Is that the document we're talking about?
MS. MENNINGER: Counsel, if you have an
objection, you should state the basis for your
objection in a non-leading, non-suggestive manner.
If you have any other record to make, you
can do so in a pleading filed with the Court.
MR. EDWARDS: Sure. My objection is
you've misrepresented what you've handed the witness.
I want to make sure that the witness is holding what
you actually want her to be holding as opposed to the
lawsuit you said that you were going to hand her.
That's it.
MS. MENNINGER: Counsel, I will ask the

January 19th, 2015?
A
At the very top of the page it says
January 21st, 2015.
The date it was filed. Is there a date
just above the signature block?
A
oh, yes, sorry. Yes, there is.
And what date -- what date was that?
A
The 19th day of January, 2015.
Okay. And this document is something that
you believe contains the truth, correct?
A
To the best of my knowledge at the time,
yes.
All right. Did something change between
the time then and today that makes you believe that
it's not all accurate?
Well, as you can see, in line 4 on page 1,
I wasn't aware of my dates. I was just doing the
best to guesstimate when I actually met them.
Since then I've been able to find out that
through my Mar-a-Lago records that it was actually
the summer of 2000, not the summer of 1999.
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you back on page 1?
A
On the first page.
Okay.

Yes.

MR. EDWARDS: Objection. Asked and
answered.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) You may answer.
MR. EDWARDS: Answer again.
A
Again, I wouldn't say it's untrue. Untrue
would mean that I would have lied. And I didn't lie.
This was my best knowledge at the time. And I did my
very best to try to pinpoint time periods going back
such a long time ago.
It wasn't until I found the facts that I
worked at Mar-a-Lago in 2000 that I was able to
figure that out.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) And approximately when
did you learn those facts about the dates you worked
at Mar-a-Lago?
A
I would say it was mid-2015.
Mid-2015 is the first time you became
aware of the dates --
A
I don't know the exact --
If you could just let me finish.
A
I'm sorry.
That's all right. Approximately mid-2015
when you learned the true dates that you had worked
at Mar-a-Lago?
A
That's correct. Sorry.

MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
A
Uhm, I don't know, to be honest.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) And in what order did
Taco Bell, Publix and Mar-a-Lago go, and the aviary,
sorry?
A
Oh, I would have to guess. Do you want me
to guess?
Sure.
A
Um, I would say Publix. And then, I think
that's when I helped my boyfriend out at Taco Bell
and then I think the aviary.
And where was the Taco Bell?
A
I was living in Fort Lauder -- I think it
was Fort Lauderdale.
Don't quote me on that, but
somewhere in Florida, Broward County, something like
that.
A
And who were you living with at that time?
Michael. His name is James, but Michael.
So you were living with Michael when you
worked at the Taco Bell, right?
A
Yes, I was living with him.
And you worked with Michael when you
worked at the Publix, correct?
A
No.
Okay. So Publix came after Taco Bell or

A
| Loxahatchee, Florida
33470.
How is it that you came to work at
Mar-a-Lago?
A
My dad is a maintenance manager or
supervisor, I don't know what you call it. But he
worked in the maintenance department, mostly on
tennis courts, working on the air conditioning,
helping set up for functions. And he got me a summer
job there.
Okay. And you said you were on a break?
A
Yes.
What were you on a break from?
A
I think like -- this is going back so long
now, but I was attempting to get my GED. And it,
summer came, so school stops during the summertime
here in America, and I got a summer job.
All right. And where were you in school?
I don't actually know the name of the
place. It's -- yeah, I know.
A GED place?

Yeah, it was, like, I was previously in
Royal Palm Beach High School, but, I mean, because of

Okay. If I can direct your attention back
to Defendant's Exhibit 12 at page 15. And under the
heading Response to Interrogatory Number 9, do you
see that where it says --
A
Yes.
-- Ms. Joffrey (pronouncing) -- Giuffre,
excuse me, responds as follows?
A
Yes.
Okay. It says you worked as a locker room
attendant for the spa area, correct?
A
Yes.
And it says records produced in this case
identify the date of employment as 2000, correct?
A
Yes.
What records that were produced in this
case cause you to believe that the employment began
in 2000?
A
Uhm, is this going back to another
question that I'm not allowed to answer?
No.
A
I have seen the documents, and I know that
my employment now was in 2000.
What documents did you see that caused you
to make that answer?
A
The Mar-a-Lago employment documents.

masseuses had their own uniforms.
What did the masseuses' uniform look like?
A
I don't remember.
No recollection at all?
A
None whatsoever.
Color?
A
No, sorry. I remember mine.
Okay. How did it come to pass that you
were no longer working at Mar-a-Lago in two to three
weeks?
A
I was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell.
Okay. And how long had you been working
at Mar-a-Lago when you were approached by Ghislaine
Maxwell?
A
Roughly two to three weeks.
Okay. Where in the spa were you when you
were approached by Ghislaine Maxwell?
A
Just outside the locker room, sitting
where the other girl that works there usually sits.
She was away from the desk. I was reading a book on
massage therapy.
Was that indoors or outdoors?
A
Outdoors.
Okay. And what -- were you in the sun or
in the shade?

locker room attendant one day. And. Yeah.
What was the name of the massage therapist
that you were speaking with?
A
oh, I have no idea.
Can you give me any physical description
of any of them?
A
Um, there was one who had blonde short
hair. There was -- I would say there's probably
about four massage therapists that work in there.
So, I mean, I don't remember all of them.
Okay. What time of day was it?
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.

with Ms. Maxwell?

told me that she knew somebody who was looking for a
traveling masseuse.
And I said, Well, I don't have any
accreditations. This
is the first book I've ever
read. She goes, That's okay. I know somebody. We
can train you. We can get you educated. You know,
we can help you along the way if you pass the
interview.
If the guy likes you, then, you know, it
will work out for you. You'll travel. You'll make
good money. You'll be educated, and you'll finally
get accredited one day.
Okay.
A
She finished off by, you know, giving me
her number. And I told her I'd have to ask my dad.
And I called my dad. I ran over, actually, to see my
dad, talked to him. He said it would be okay. I
used the phone from Mar-a-Lago to call her and tell
her that I was allowed to come over.
And she said, Great. Meet me here at -- I
don't remember the exact address, but it was
El Brillo Way in Palm Beach -- after you get off.
And my dad drove me.
Did you write down her add -- the address
that she gave?

Did you write down her phone number?
A
Yes.
So did you go run and talk to your dad
while she was still there?
No, I believe she left. And she told me
to ask my dad and then to give her a phone call.
Okay. Did she ask you your age when she
had that conversation with you?
A
No, she did not.
Did you tell her your age?
No, I did not.
And so somewhere you wrote down a phone
number to call her back at?
A

down?

Probably just a piece of paper lying
around the desk.

A
A Dodge Dakota.
And did you purchase that yourself?
A
Yes, I did.
And how much did it cost?

how much it cost.
Who did you buy it from?
A
My dad helped me bargain with it. I don't
remember where we bought it from.
And was the title put in your name or your
dad's name?
I think the title was put in my name.
I
think. I mean, my dad was with me. I've never
registered a car or anything like that before.
So --
So that was your first time?
A
Yes.
Memorable, right?
A
Yes.
When you got there, a butler or someone
answered the door, is that what you said?
A
No, Ghislaine answered the door.

with me at that time.
So he might have been there.
Do you recall if he was there when you got

I don't really remember. I remember what
I did when I got home, that I basically made a
beeline for the bathroom.
Let me ask you a question. Michael was
living with you at that home, at your parents' home
at the time, is your best recollection today; is that
right?
A
That's my best recollection, yes.
when you say living with you, were you
guys staying in the same room?

Yes.

was a friend who looked after me, and he did propose
to me and I did say yes. But my heart was never in

it.
He was somebody that helped me off the
streets so I felt compelled to say yes to him.
Okay. So when he proposed to you and you
said yes, did that take place before you started
working at Mar-a-Lago or after you started working at
Mar-a-Lago?
A
Before.
And so if he were living with your parents
at that time, you were living in the same room; is
that correct?
I believe so.
And your parents understood him to be your
fiance?
A
I don't think they agreed with it, but I
think they understood it as that. I mean --
I mean, you communicated to them that he
had proposed and you had accepted?
A
Yeah, in not such a pretty way. I mean,
they obviously weren't very happy about it. And it
wasn't my true intentions to ever marry him.
Okay.

But I did it to make him feel okay. I
didn't want to be mean.

It is your contention that, Ghislaine
Maxwell had sex with underage girls virtually every
day when I was around her, correct?
A
Yes.
All right. With whom did Ghislaine
Maxwell have sex in your presence?
A
Well, there's a lot of girls that were
involved. We weren't on a first name basis with each
other. I wouldn't be able to give you lists of names

of girls. It was continuous.
It was continuous. Name one girl that
Ghislaine Maxwell had sex with in your presence.
A
Emmy Taylor. I mean, that's a name that I
know well because Emmy was always around.
I'm trying to think of her name, sorry.
Sarah. Her name used to be Sarah Kellen. I think
she's changed it now that she's married.
(phonetic) -- I can't
pronounce her last name properly, but it's around
those lines.
There were a lot of other girls that I
honestly can't remember their names. I'm sorry. I
wish I could help out more because I really would
like to provide more witnesses for this, but I can't

I would say more than 20.
More than 50?

I don't think more than 50, but --
Did --
A
I don't have an exact number. I mean,
if -- I think if you look at the flight logs, you

complete. We only have flight logs to one plane and
then there's a time I was flown commercially into the

So it's really hard for me to gauge a

number.
Okay. Do you have any photographs of

think I met Prince Andrew in 2001. And Glenn Dubin
and Stephen Kaufmann were, like I said, the first
people I was sent out to after my training. So I
don't know. I'm not going to give you an exact time
if I don't know it.
I asked you the relative order.
A
And I'm trying to give you it.
And where does Alan Dershowitz fit into
that group of people?
Same. I can't tell you piece by piece by
piece who -- I know Glenn Dubin was first.
Okay.
A
And I know Stephen Kaufmann was one of the
first I was sent to. Alan Dershowitz could have been
between there. Between, sorry, between Glenn and
Stephen. The first time I was with Alan Dershowitz
was in New York, so I wasn't actually sent to him.
It actually happened at one of Jeffrey's residences.
(Ms. McCawley left the deposition.)
A
So it's very hard for me to
chronologically give you each person individually.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. Name the other
politically connected and financially powerful people
that Ghislaine Maxwell told you to go have sex with?

Again, I'm going to tell you "they"

because that's how it went. They instructed me to go
to George Mitchell, Jean Luc Brunel, Bill Richardson,
another prince that I don't know his name. A guy
that owns a hotel, a really large hotel chain, I
can't remember which hotel it was. Marvin Minsky.
There was, you know, another foreign
president, I can't remember his name. He was
Spanish. There's a whole bunch of them that I
just -- it's hard for me to remember all of them.
You know, I was told to do something by these people
constantly, told to -- my whole life revolved around
just pleasing these men and keeping Ghislaine and
Jeffrey happy. Their whole entire lives revolved
around sex.
They call massages sex.
They call
modeling sex. They call --
I asked you the names for people. Are you
going to tell me any other names or is that all of
them?
A
I'm trying to think.
That's the answer
I'm trying to give to you. It's that it's so hard to
just keep naming and naming and naming.
All right.

many times you want me to keep answering this
question. Both told me to do this, okay? They both
sent me to these people.
How many times do you want me to answer
this?
(BY MS. MENNINGER) I think you're
answering a different question so that's why I'm
going to ask you again. I am not asking you anything
about a time when Jeffrey and Ghislaine together told
you to go do something. I'm asking you to name a
single time during which Ghislaine Maxwell acting
alone directed you to go have sex with another
person?
MR. EDWARDS: Objection. Asked and
answered. Harassing. Argumentative.
A
I've given you the names of the people
that Ghislaine instructed me to go have sexual
relations with. I am not discluding (sic) the fact
that Jeffrey also told me.
Ghislaine told me from her mouth to do
these things. Jeffrey told me from his mouth to do
these things with these people. Ghislaine instructed
me to do the things that I did with Jeffrey Epstein
on the very first meeting that I had with him. She
brought me there under the preclusion (sic) that I

was going to be trained as a masseuse and that she
instructed me to take off my clothes and to give oral
sex to Jeffrey Epstein.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Excuse me.
I've asked
you for the names.
I've just given you a name. Jeffrey
Epstein is a big name.
All right.
A
She instructed me on that one.
So you're saying --
MR. EDWARDS: The witness is finishing her
answer right now. She's in the process of explaining
one of the people Ghislaine told her to have sex
with.
(BY MS. MENNINGER)
So you're saying
Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to have sex with
Jeffrey Epstein?
A
Correct.
Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to have sex
with Glenn Dubin?
A
Correct.
What words did Ghislaine Maxwell tell you
to go have sex with Glenn Dubin?
A
It was the same all the time, all right?
They want me to go provide these men with a massage.

where I was sent to. I don't know where we were when

A
I have answered the question. I was sent
to New Mexico.
Okay. Where were you sent from?
A
I already answered that. I don't know

No, she was not in the room.
She was in
another cabana.
And other than telling you to go give the
owner of this large hotel chain a massage, do you
remember any other words she used to you to direct
you in what you should do?
A
Not at the time, no.

Ms. Maxwell when she directed you to go have sex with
Marvin Minsky?

have sex with Marvin Minsky?

Jeff's -- sorry, Jeffrey Epstein's island in the U.S.

another prince, the large hotel chain owner and
Marvin Minsky, is there anyone else that Ghislaine
Maxwell directed you to go have sex with?
A
I am definitely sure there is. But can I
remember everybody's name? No.
Okay •
Can you remember anything else
about them?
A
Look, I've given you what I know right
now. I'm sorry. This is very hard for me and very
frustrating to have to go over this. I don't -- I
don't recall all of the people. There was a large
amount of people that I was sent to.
Do you have any notes of all these people
that you were sent to?
A
No, I don't.
Where are your notes?
A
I burned them.
When did you burn them?
A
In a bonfire when I lived at Titusville
because I was sick of going through this shit.
Did you have lawyers who were representing
you at the time you built a bonfire and burned these
notes?

I've been represented for a long time, but

this. My husband and I were pretty spiritual people
and we believed that these memories were worth
burning.
So you burned notes of the men with whom
you had sex while you were represented by counsel in
litigation, correct?
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
A
This wasn't anything that was a public
document. This was my own private journal, and I
didn't want it anymore. So we burned it.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) When did you write
that journal?
A
Just over time. I started writing it
probably in, I don't know, I can't speculate, 2012,
2011.
So you did not write this journal at the
time it happened?
A
No.
You started writing this journal
approximately a decade after you claim you finished
being sexually trafficked, correct?
A
Yes.
And you started writing a journal after
you had a lawyer, correct?
A
Correct.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the
record at 2:55.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Do you have any
photographs of yourself either nude or in a sexually
compromising position that you claim were taken by
Ghislaine Maxwell?
A
I do not have any of those in my evidence.
But if you ask Ghislaine Maxwell, she would have
plenty.
Do you have any in your storage boxes in
Sydney?
A
No.
Do you know whether your attorneys have
any such photographs that you claim were taken by
Ghislaine Maxwell?
A
No.
You don't know or they don't have them?
A
I don't know. And I don't think they have
them. If they had them, they would have told me.
You should ask your client. She's got plenty of
them.
What type of camera did Ghislaine Maxwell
use?
A
It was a black camera. And it had a, I
don't know the types and names of them, but the lens

that goes out.
Was it digital or single reflex?
A
Again, I don't know types of cameras. I
mean, I use my phone for using a camera. So it's a
black camera and it had a lens that you could put out
further or bring back.
Did you ask her to take any photographs of
you?
A
No. She asked to take photographs of me.
Was it a film or a digital camera?
A
I never saw how she printed them out.
What's the first time you told anybody
that you had been sexually trafficked?
MR. EDWARDS: Form.
A
Tony Figueroa, my ex-boyfriend, knew some
of the stuff that was happening, though I did not go
in great detail to him, being that he's my boyfriend.
And then the first person I really opened up to about
everything was my husband.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Did you tell Tony
Figueroa that you were forced to have sex with
Jeffrey Epstein?
A
Yes.
Did you tell Tony Figueroa you were forced
to have sex with Ghislaine Maxwell?

any interactions with law enforcement?
A
Yes.
When?
A
When I tried to break away from Jeffrey
and Ghislaine, I started making myself unavailable.
And I got a job at Road House Grill. And Tony used
to come pick me up in the afternoons, at nighttime,
and he'd sit at the bar. And there's this big cup
that's got tips in it.
I was in the back room. And I had to --
first you have to sign out and you have to take off
your aprons, put your aprons away. And there's a
whole bunch of cleaning up stuff you have to do.
In that time period, Tony grabbed money
from a cup that had money in it. That was for the
bartenders for their tips. My boss called me the
next day. He told me that I had stolen the money,
which I hadn't. And I came back and I returned the
money after I confronted Tony about it. Gave the
money back to him and he said, I'm sorry, but it's
just law that I have to call the police. So he
called the police.
And knowing that Jeffrey has got the Palm
Beach Police Department in his pocket, I went to
Jeffrey Epstein and I told him what had happened.

care of it for you.
Okay. I'm sorry. When did you have
interaction with law enforcement, then?
A
What year?
Did you speak with a law enforcement
officer?
A
I don't believe I spoke to them. Jeffrey
handled everything.
Okay. And you said that you had finished
your shift at -- this is at the Road House Grill,
correct?

Correct.
You had finished your shift?
A
Yeah, it was the end of the shift.
Okay. And you had cleaned up and were
checking out, correct?

exclusivity?

I believe it was like a three-month period
or something.
Okay. And what other terms of the
contract, do you recall?
A
I couldn't talk to any other news
publication about the story.
Anything else?
A
Not that I know of.
Were you happy when the period was up?
A
well, I mean, at that time I wanted to
write about my story. So I guess, yes, I was happy
when that period was up.
And you were actively writing a book at
that time, correct?
A
My manuscript. I've never published it.
You were writing the manuscript at the
time of your period of exclusivity with Sharon

People -- I'm trying to think of the name of the
word. People who publish books, not like a newspaper
or anything. And I inquired about what they thought
of my manuscript and if they thought it was, you
know, a good story. And, yeah.

correct?

Some people, yes.
And you were trying to get money from the
book publication, correct?

Well, I wasn't going to sell it to them
for free.
But you were unsuccessful in finding
someone to publish it, correct?

who have done this plenty and plenty of times.

who have been interested in it and I still don't know

lot more that can go into it, you know.
You were actively sending the manuscript
to people for purposes of having them reach a deal
with you and publish it, correct?
No deal was ever talked about. What we
talked about was the possibility of publishing it, is
it publishing-worthy, would I need to get a
ghostwriter. You know, this is the first time I've

Before you met Jeffrey Epstein, had you
used any drugs?
A
Sure, yes.
Which drugs had you used prior to meeting
Jeffrey Epstein?
A
I smoked pot. I've taken Ecstasy.
Cocaine?
Yeah, I would have snorted cocaine,
A

Did you ever abuse alcohol before meeting
Jeffrey Epstein?

No, I was -- I wasn't even of age to be

parties I would have drank it, but I wouldn't say I
abused it.
Okay. Were there ever occasions upon
which you were observed to be drunk by other people,
prior to meeting Jeffrey Epstein?
A
If you're drinking, the possibility of
getting drunk is always there. I don't -- I can't
recall exact situation where that was the case,
but --
Were you diagnosed as a drug addict prior
to meeting Jeffrey Epstein?

A
Yes.
And you believe the Neiman Marcus was
located in which city?
A
Well, it's around Fort Lauderdale.
can't tell you exactly. Fort Lauderdale is so big,
like Broward County? Is that the word for it?
And what did you do at Neiman Marcus?
A
I worked in the changing rooms.
And what did you do in the changing room?
A
I think I just like -- if I remember
right, I just put clothes away that people left in
there. Probably went out to get sizes, different
sizes for women who wanted different sizes of the
same product.
And where did you work after Neiman
Marcus?
A
Taco Bell.
Did you work at Southeast Employee
Management Company?
A
I don't recognize that. I don't know if
that's a payroll company or what it is. I don't know
what Southeast -- what is it called?
Southeast Employee Management Company.
A
No, I don't remember that.
Did you ever work as a temp?

Not that I remember.
Going to different offices and filling in?
A
No.
Did you work for Oasis Outsourcing?
A
I don't -- I don't know if that's a
payroll company or if that's an actual place, but
that doesn't ring a bell.
Did you -- do you know how much you got
paid when you were working at places like Oasis
Outsourcing?
A
Well, considering I don't know if I worked
at Oasis Outsourcing, I wouldn't even know how much I
got paid.
Did you review your Social Security
records?
A
Yes.
You saw Oasis Outsourcing listed there?
A
Right, but like I said, it doesn't even
ding a bell at all.
Do you know how much money they said you
made from them?
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. If you want to
show her the documents, she can see what amount is
listed and answer your questions, but if you're not
going to show her the document, that's the best she

A
Yeah, if you could. I'm happy to answer
your questions. I want to be helpful, so...
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Great. Well, do you
remember how much money you made from Oasis
Out sourcing?
A
Like I said, I don't even remember working
for Oasis Outsourcing, or what it is, so I couldn't
tell you.
Do you remember how much money you were
making per hour at Neiman Marcus?
A
No, not off the top of my head.
Do you know how many months you worked
there?
A
Not long. I'd probably say -- I mean, I
don't know. I'm not going to guess. But around the
three-month mark would be my -- I don't know the
exact answer.
Do you remember any of your coworkers?
A
No.
Did you work at Mannino's?
A
Briefly, yes.
What is Mannino's?
A cute little Italian restaurant in

I did waitressing.

No.

I was -- that's around the time period
that I was approached by -- I can't remember his
name, but he owned a veterinary clinic or he was a
vet, one of the two, and he offered me to come work
for him.
When you were working at TG - - TGI

No.

Tony picked me up and took some money out of

was called in to protect Ms. Maxwell's reputation, and
2
to set the record straight. That was -- and that work
3
commenced on or around March of 2011.
4
l.
What do you mean by "set the record straight"?
5
A. Ms. Guiffre's allegations about Ms. Maxwell
6
were, we believe, and to this day continue to believe,
7
untrue, defamatory, and fantastical. And with
8
Devonshires' lawyers, we set about putting out --
9
crafting a statement which would put Ms. Maxwell's point
10
of view across that Ms. Guiffre's allegations were untrue
11
and, frankly, abhorrent.
12
l. What advice did you give Miss Maxwell as part
13
of your retention?
14
A. It is standard procedure in cases where it's
15
understood that a party may be defaming one's client that
16
one puts out a statement correcting those allegations and
17
providing a clearer picture of where the truth lies.
So
18
it was very much our counsel that Ms. Maxwell put out a
19

When you testified that Ms. Guiffre, I'm going
21

to refer to her by just her married name, came to your
attention at that March 2011 meeting at Devonshires with

24
Mr. Barden and Ms. Maxwell, correct, and you learned
about her at that meeting; is that correct?

morning to drive my family back from the south of
France to England, which is a 14-hour journey, door to
door.
So on the morning of the 2nd of January,
bearing in mind that Ms. Maxwell, I think was in New
York then, she was five hours behind, so there was
quite a lot of, sort of time difference between the
various countries here, I sent her an email, I
believe, saying -- parsing this -- forwarding this
email to her saying "How do you wish to proceed?" And
then I was on the telephone -- I had two telephones in
the car, I received in excess of 30 phone calls from
various media outlets on the 2nd of January, all
asking for information about how Ms. Maxwell was
looking to respond to the latest court filings, which
were filed on the 30th of December as I understand.
And by close -- towards close of play
on the 2nd, I received an email forwarded by
Ms. Maxwell, containing a draft statement which my
understanding was the majority of which had been
drafted by Mr. Barden with a header along the lines of
"This is the agreed statement." At close of play on
the 2nd.
So I -- I was

Channel Tunnel and I was sitting on the other side and

sent out to a number of media, including Mr. Ball and
various other UK newspapers.
Q.
Mr. Gow, when you say "end of play" and "close
of play," are you referring to sending the email that's
Exhibit 2?
A. Yes, I am.
MR. DYER: My understanding is that it went to
people other than those listed?
THE WITNESS: Yes, that is --
MR. DYER: Just a sample.
THE WITNESS: That is a sample. Everyone who
effectively -- well, the detail on this, I was driving,
so my eldest son in the back had my BlackBerry and was
trying to capture -- it was a pretty chaotic day.
Most people in the UK were on holiday. In fact,
it was a holiday weekend, our office was closed, my PA was
on holiday, so my son was basically doing an internship in
the back of the car, downloading the names of the callers
from various media outlets and -- so we had a list of
those so when I got to the car park, at the end of the
Eurotunnel thing in the UK, I had numerous names, so the
email went out to a wide range of people.
But the 30 or so calls I had is an aggregate
number, so there might have been five calls from the BBC

2
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday
3
in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not necessarily accessible,
4
at some point in time, so this had been sent to him
originally by Ms. Maxwell, and because he was
6
unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action.

I therefore respond, "Okay, Ghislaine, I'll go with
8 this."

It is my understanding that this is

command: "This is the statement."
Q. Okay.
A. And I say, "Thanks, Philip" because I'm aware

17
18
of the fact that he had a hand, a considerable hand in
the drafting.
l. Okay. Could I ask you to please refer back to
19
Exhibit 2. Looking also at Exhibit 9, Exhibit 9 appears
20
to have five sentences in it. Do you agree that those
21
same five sentences are part of the communication that is
22
borne in Exhibit 2?

Sorry, could you say that again. I'm just
following what your --

It was a bad question. Let me try that again.

that I might have done, but I can't recall the detail,
I'm afraid.
l. Do you -- do you remember discussing that with
The Guardian?
A. No, I don't. I'm not saying I didn't but I
can't recall. You have to bear in mind, if you'd be so
kind, that I've been speaking to over 30 journalists and
media outlets about this, and I can't recall every single
-- the detail of every single conversation.
Earlier you testified with regard to Exhibit 2
that in the days following sending that email, you also
communicated with other press and media outlets. Do you
recall today any of the other press and media outlets you
communicated with, in addition to those listed at the top
of that email?
A.
The Guardian, The Sun, from the top of my
memory, but in addition to -- in addition to emails there
would have been telephone calls and I'm -- there may not
be a transcript of those calls, these are emails inter
alia, others, and I can't recall every single email that

were always referred to, both of which -- well, the first
one was in a public domain and was on record on the

was easily accessible by people. And the second one was

how many other emails do you believe you sent bearing
that statement that's in Exhibit 2?

six and probably less than 30, somewhere in between.
Any time there was an incoming query
it was either dealt with on the telephone by referring
them back to the two statements of March 2011 and
January 2015 or someone would email them the
statement. So no one was left unanswered, broadly, is

l. Is it correct that public relations and
strategic communications are things that you personally
do as part of your professional activities?
A.
I personally -- I'm involved in public
relations and strategic communications, yes.
l.
Is it correct that the media is the intended
recipient of this strategic communications.
A. It's -- the -- it's a larger ground than just
the media. There may be lobbyists, government think
tanks, focus groups, government departments.
l.
Would it be fair to say that the media is often
the intended recipient of strategic communications?
A.
It is a frequent recipient.
l. Referent recipient?
A. But not the sole recipient.
Q.
Okay. Do you see where your website claims
that your company has "excellent relationships with the
media"?
A.
A.
I do.
l. Is that a true statement?
That is true, yeah.

the issue of proceedings in September of last year?
THE WITNESS:
I don't,
sir. It's always been
18
the case that Mr. Barden and I were encouraging
19 Ms. Maxwell to make a statement, but she was very
20
reluctant to do so.
21
MR. DYER: Right. I think you've got him to
22
accept that up until some time March, April, May, he may
23
have spoken to Mr. Syson. And that was the last
24
statement that there's any evidence of him making about
25
this matter. But on the evidence, as I understand it,

EXAMINATION
BY MR. PAGLIUCA:
Q. Ms.
, by name is Jeff Pagluica. I
live in Denver, Colorado. And, like you, I don't
want to be here today either, okay? I would rather
be in Denver.
I just want to -- as I understand it, and
I'm not trying to get into any of your treatment
over the last, let's say, 10 years, because I don't
know how long it's been, but as I understand what
you and your lawyer have said here today, you have
been involved in some number of years of therapy, in
which the purpose -- part of the purpose of the
therapy has been to forget all of these events that
Mr. Edwards was asking you questions about; is that
correct?

Q. I'm not talking about friends. I'm
talking about individuals --
MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to object
to you interrupting the witness who was
answering your question. The question
was, have you ever seen anyone, female
under the age of 18 at the house and
that's the question she was answering.
If you want to strike that question and
ask another question, feel free, but let
the witness respond, please.
MS. MCCAWLEY: I will do that.
. Have you ever observed a female
under the age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home
that was not a friend, a child -- one of your
friend's children?
A.
Again, I can't testify to that
because I have no idea what you are talking
about.
l. You have no idea what I'm talking
about in the sense you never observed a
female under the age of 18 at Jeffrey
Epstein's home that was not one of your
friend's children, is that correct?

A. How would I possibly know how
someone is when they are at his house. You
are asking me to do that. I cannot possibly
testify to that. As far as I'm concerned,
everyone who came to his house was an adult
professional person.
Q. Are you familiar with the police
report that was issued in respect to the
investigation in this matter?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

Q. Are you familiar with the police
report that was used in this matter, the
investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, has been

A.
I have seen a police report.

-- just another one of Virginia's many
fictitious lies and stories to make this a
salacious event to get interest and press.
It's absolute rubbish.
Were you in charge of hiring
individuals to provide massages for Jeffrey
Epstein?
A. My job included hiring many people.
There were six homes.
: I sit here, I hired
assistants, I hired architects, I hired
decorators, I hired cooks, I hired cleaners,
I hired gardeners, I hired pool people, I
hired pilots, I hired all sorts of people.
In the course and a very small part
of my job was from from time to time to find
adult professional massage therapists for
Jeffrey.
Q.
When you say adult professional
massage therapists, where did you find these
massage therapists?
A.
From time to time I would visit
professional spas, I would receive a massage
and if the massage was good I would ask that
man or woman if they did home visits.

Q. Did you hire her?

like that, so let's be clear, I already
testified to that, and I have no idea what
6 you are referring to.
Q. When you say girls like that, what
do you mean?
A. I hire people who are professional
at the house. You are asking if I hired
somebody to do what, I don't know what you
are talking about. I hired people to work in
the homes.
What was Nadia Marcinkova doing?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

A. I have no idea what Nadia
Marcinkova was doing. I didn't hire her and
I don't know what you are referring to.
Q. You met Nadia Marcinkova?
A. I testified I did.

Did she work for Jeffrey Epstein?

over to the house in Palm Beach to give

A. It's important to understand that I
wasn't with Jeffrey all the time. In fact, I
was only in the house less than half the
time, so I cannot testify to when I wasn't in
the house how often she came when I wasn't
there.

What I can say is that I barely

rubbish, I probably wouldn't remember her at

but I don't recollect her coming as often as
she portrayed herself.
Q. How many times a day on an average
day would Jeffrey Epstein get a massage?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
form and foundation.
A.
When I was at the house and when I
was there with him, he received a massage, on
average, about once a day.
Just once?

Yes.

Epstein's planes with President Clinton, is
that correct?

President Clinton and Jeffrey are friends?
A. I wouldn't be able to characterize
it like that, no.
Are they acquaintances?

I wouldn't categorize it.

Did you want to correct anything?

I want to make an addendum.
Would you mind rereading the last
question back to me?

A. I also just want to say that at
this point I cannot recollect flying to
parties. Jeffrey went for work so -- was
this in Santa Fe, this flight as well.
l. The flight we were looking at, yes
but it was to Santa Fe --
A. I don't recall going to any parties
in Santa Fe at any time but certainly flying
to Santa Fe for a party seems highly
improbable.
So I'm going to direct your
attention to the document that I set before
you which is Bates number SAO 01456 and it
has different Bates numbers because it's a
smaller version of the larger production.
These are the pages I will be asking about.

taking messages when incoming phone calls
came in?
A. You are supposed to take a message

down. Who was the message was for, what time
it was taken and who took it and what the
message was, obviously.

MR. PAGLIUCA: These all have SAO

don't see any of your Bates ranges on

these are different documents.

What I'm asking you is whether you

MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form
and you made your record, she answered
the question. A fair reading of her
answer is she doesn't have a belief
because she doesn't have any personal
knowledge.
MS. MCCAWLEY: Now you are
testifying for the witness. Let her
answer the question.
MR. PAGLIUCA: It's a fair answer
to the question.
A. Again, I testified my only personal
knowledge concerns Virginia and everything
Virginia has said is an absolute lie, which
is why we are here in this room. If you are
asking me to testify about things I have no
knowledge of other than the police report
that you showed me, I am not in a position to

said is a lie. Therefore, based on those
lies I cannot speculate on what anybody else
did or didn't do because if Virginia is the
example of what that story is and everything
she said is false, so everything that leads
from that is false.
2. So the 30 other minor children in
the police report are also telling lies about
being sexually abused during massages with
Mr. Epstein?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
form and foundation. Counsel, can you
show me in these police reports who the
30 minors are?
MS. MCCAWLEY: I'm asking my
question.
MR. PAGLIUCA: You are making a
representation about numbers, you are
making a representation on the record
about what people said or didn't say.
We have no knowledge about that. These
are all redacted records so these are
bad questions.
They don't lead to any

Please. Her statement also that

She was driven by her mother, as a matter of
fact. Her whole entire characterization of
the first meeting with Jeffrey, as I was
outside speaking to her mother.
2. Let me stop you there, so we don't
get too far ahead. Let me make sure I
understand your testimony.
The first, in the first piece when
you were talking, I believe you said and
correct me if I'm wrong, that her
characterization of the first meeting at
Mar-a-Lago was an obvious lie.
What part of that meeting was an
obvious lie?
A. By her own testimony, all her
various many different descriptions of what
she was or wasn't or where she was or wasn't,
they have all changed. She was either front
of house or bathroom attendant. I don't know

doesn't know what's true and what isn't true.
Q. Are you saying what position she
said she was working in, is that what you are
considering the obvious lie?
A. I said inconsistency within her own
statement from everything, so in the
beginning it starts off with different
statements.

You can be a professional masseuse

professional masseuse showed up for a
massage. There is nothing inappropriate or
incorrect about that and your
mischaracterization of it, I think is
unfortunate.

his home?

What I said was that we can all
agree and I think at this point there is not
one person in this room, however much you
would like her to be younger, to say she was
not 17 because that has been a very offensive
thing that you have all done. So she was 17.
At 17 you are allowed to be a professional
masseuse and as far as I'm concerned, she was
a professional masseuse. There is nothing
inappropriate or incorrect about her coming
at that time to give a massage. Her entire
characterization of her first time at the
house was to me an obvious lie, given it was
impossible for her entire story to take place
given I was speaking to her mother the entire
she was at the house.
So it was impossible that day, that
first day she came and you were speaking to
the mother, for Virginia Roberts to have had
sex with Jeffrey Epstein during the time that
you were outside with her mother?

A. I have testified that I'm
responsible for finding professional people
to work in the homes, age appropriate adult
people, so from pool attendants, to
gardeners, to chefs, to housekeepers, to
butlers, to chauffeurs and one of the
functions was to be able to answer the

Q. And were trash pulls done at the property
of Jeffrey Epstein?
A.
Yes.
Q. What is the purpose of a trash pull, and
what is a trash pull?
A. A trash pull is when property is
discarded, such as trash, we coordinate with the
sanitation department to collect the trash, once it
leaves the property, and it's put into an empty well
of the trash truck. We acquire the bags, and we
sift through the contents of the trash.
2. Did you or another detective from the unit
observe each step of the trash pull to make sure
that you had a good chain of custody of the
evidence?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
foundation.
THE WITNESS: Yes. The members of
the OCTAN unit at that time did.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Okay. And what is that process?

The process --
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

THE WITNESS: The process is when the --
once you coordinate a trash pull with the
sanitation supervisor, you meet with the
sanitation worker and ensure that either the
can that he's going to place in the well is
completely empty and you physically observe him
collect the trash and place it into the empty
container. And then you follow him to a
disclosed area, and we retrieve the bags and
you sift through the trash.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Okay. What were you looking for in terms
of evidentiary value from these trash pulls?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

THE WITNESS:
We were looking for any --
any form of identification. You were looking
for -- to gather any kind of intelligence

from HR to SG confirming an appointment to go
work at Epstein's residence.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
l. The next line down is what I wanted to
focus on, April 5th, 2005.
This trash pull, what evidence is yielded
from this particular trash pull?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
foundation.
THE WITNESS:
The trash pull indicated
that there were several messages with written
items on it. There was
• a message from HR

appointment.
There were other individuals that
had called during that day.

school; left message for Courtney W and NI," are
these individuals that you later learned were
underaged girls that had been to Jeffrey Epstein's
home?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
foundation.
THE WITNESS: That's correct.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
2. What types of documents do you remember
retrieving from the trash pulls from Jeffrey
Epstein's home?
A. There was numerous items. It was a lot of
handwritten notes on different -- different pads of
paper. Some of the pads had names on it, whether it
was Epstein, whether it was Ghislane Maxwell,
whether it was -- there were phone messages.
When I say "phone messages," I mean, you
know, the kind that come in a book. They are carbon
copied, so the yellow copy always stays with the
book, but the white copy is torn off. So there was
always a carbon copy of the actual phone message.

Q. And so what was the evidentiary value to
you of the message pads collected from Jeffrey
Epstein's home in the search warrant?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

THE WITNESS: It was very important to
corroborate what the victims had already told
me as to calling in and for work.

Okay. And did you learn the identities of
some of the other individuals associated with
Jeffrey Epstein through the review of that
particular evidence?

even Nadia. And what I found very repulsive,
out of the ordinary, was Nadia was wearing a
swimsuit that was very revealing and
basically, her bottom basically went up her
butt, revealing all of her buttocks. So
again, in the context not very appropriate
for the situation.
Could you tell the relationship of
age between the three girls that you have
described and Nadia, for instance?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

A. Nadia seemed to be a bit older, I
would say.
Q. How does this end, or is there,
what do you do next? How does this meeting
that you've just described break up?
A.
I asked to excuse myself and asked
where the bathroom was, so I'm pointed inside
the house, to go inside the house to the
bathroom.
I walk in there, and I walk, as I'm
walking to the bathroom, what caught my eye,
and I had to take a double lock, there were

pictures of naked women, half-dressed girls.
So I went to the bathroom, again, from
someone, myself working in private service, I
always know in houses there are cameras, so
again, I was very reluctant to stare, because
you never know when you are on camera.
So I used the bathroom, and I came
out, and you know, curiosity got the best of
me, and I leaned over and started looking at
these pictures for a brief minute, and it was
just so coincidental that as I did that, Ms.
Maxwell enters, and she immediately says to
me that Jeffrey would like for me to rejoin
the party immediately.
Q. How many pictures of nude females
did you see in Jeffrey Epstein's home?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form
and foundation.
A.
I can't recall the exact number.
Can you describe the pictures that
you saw in terms of what the people, what the
people or person within the picture was
wearing, what the age range would be of the
person that's in the photograph, any poses,

What happens next when Ghislaine
Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein and a 15-year-old
girl walk into Eva Anderson's home?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form.
Foundation.
A. They proceed into the dining room
area, which is across from the living room
area. I go into the kitchen and I hear a
conversation start. Very muffled, I could
not hear any particulars about the
conversation whatsoever.
My wife and I are in the kitchen
preparing the evening meal. Eva brings the
young girl into the kitchen. In the kitchen,
there is an island with three barstools. Eva
instructs the young girl to sit to the
furthest barstool on the right.

looked like, including her demeanor and
anything else you remember about her when she
walks into the kitchen.
A. Very attractive, beautiful young
girl. Makeup, very put together, casual
dress. But she seemed to be upset, maybe
distraught, and she was shaking, and as she
sat down, she sat down and sat in the stool
exactly the way the girls that I mentioned to
you sat at Jeffrey's house, with no
expression and with their head down. But we
could tell that she was very nervous.
e. What do you mean by distraught and
shaking, what do you mean by that?
A. Shaking, I mean literally
quivering.

A.
we were, again, the absurdity,
never introduced. Like you would walk into a

there. It was a very uncomfortable moment.

moment, and so I introduced myself and I

she doesn't really respond. Nothing verbal,
no cues, her head is still down. I ask her
if she would like some water, tissue,
anything, and she basically doesn't respond.
Q. You ask her for a tissue?
A. If she would like a tissue or some
water at the time.
Q. Was she crying at the time?
A. My perception, she was on the verge
of crying. And I'm trying to loosen the
situation every way I know how, so the only
way I knew how, and I thought maybe this will
comfort her, I said oh, by the way, do you
work for Jeffrey.
And she says that, I guess kind of
made her feel comfortable, because maybe it
was that comment or my persistence, and she
said yes. So I said, what do you do? And
she says I'm Jeffrey's executive assistant,
personal assistant. Which, from looking at
her, just didn't seem to suit.

And I blurted out: You're his

executive personal assistant. I schedule his
appointments.
And I'm shocked, and I blurt out:
You seem quite young, how did you get a job?
How old are you? And she says to me, point
blank: I'm 15 years old.
And I said to her: You're 15 years
old and you have a position like that? At
that point she just breaks down hysterically,
so I feel like I just said something wrong,
and she will not stop crying. My wife and I
were at a loss for words, and I keep on
trying to console her, and nothing I was
saying, are you all right, do you need a
tissue, do you need water, consoles her.
And then in a state of shock, she
just lets it rip, and what she told me was
just unbelievable.

What did she say?

casual conversation. That quickly, I was on
an island, I was on the island and there was
Ghislaine, there was Sarah, she said they
asked me for sex, I said no.
And she is just rambling, and I'm
like what, and she said -- I asked her, I
said what? And she says yes, I was on the
island, I don't know how I got from the
island to here. Last afternoon or in the
afternoon I was on the island and now I'm
here. And I said do you have a -- this is
not making any sense to me, and I said this
is nuts, do you have a passport, do you have
a phone?
And she says no, and she says
Ghislaine took my passport. And I said what,
and she says Sarah took her passport and her
phone and gave it to Ghislaine Maxwell, and
at that point she said that she was
threatened. And I said threatened, she says
yes, I was threatened by Ghislaine not to

And I'm just shocked. So the
conversation, and she is just rambling on and
on, again, like I said, how she got here, she
doesn't know how she got here. Again, I
asked her, did you contact your parents and
she says no.
At that point, she says I'm not
supposed to talk about this. I said, but I
said: How did you get here. I don't
understand. We were totally lost for words.
And she said that before she got
there, she was threatened again by Jeffrey
and Ghislaine not to talk about what I had
mentioned earlier, about -- again, the word
she used was sex.
And during this time that you're
saying she is rambling, is her demeanor
continues to be what you described it?
A.
Yes.
Was she in fear?

Yes.

somebody that through the years 1995 through 2013
5
was somebody who flew very frequently?
6
What were the years again?
7
8
Q. The years of this book, 1995 --
A. I wouldn't say through 2013. But, yes,
9
'95 through 2000 sometime. Probably, I would have
10
to go back and -- well, you can see in there.
11
I. We will get to it.
12
A. There will be a point where you don't see
13
her much. But to say it went through 2013 would not
14 be accurate.
15
Let's do it this way:
The person that you
16
have reflected on numerous notations --
17
A.
Yes.
18
-- through here as GM --
19
A.
Yes.
20

21

know
that that is Ghislaine

Yes.

Is it a private

NO.
It's -- airlines go in there.
Did Jeffrey Epstein
also have a landing
strip at his property in New Mexico?
A.
He did at one time.

that code would be?
3
A.
I don't believe there was a code.

All right.
Were there times that you
5
landed either the Gulfstream or the Boeing --
6
A.
NO.

MR. REINHART: Let him finish the question

THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry.

Sure. We are doing fine so far. But the

We are communicating well.

A.
Okay.

Q. But when I go to read this back, we may

18
A. Okay. Go ahead.
19
So were there times where you landed one
20
of Jeffrey Epstein's planes on his private landing
21
strip at the New Mexico property?
22
A. Yes. But not the Gulfstream and not the
23 Boeing.
24

8
A.
Yeah.

And who are the passengers?
10
A.
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy

12
l. And this appears to be the first time that
13
Virginia's name appears in the log?
14
A. Right.
15
O. Is there a -- is there a reason why the
16
first time -- I notice that the first time on some
17
of the other passengers, you use a first and last
18
name. Is there any reason why you didn't use her
19
first and last name?
20
A.
I probably didn't know her last name.
21
Q.
Just didn't
catch it.
22
A.
Yes.

not to use the last name?

Do you remember the flight?

No.
The next flight three days later goes from
Teterboro to Virgin Islands with Jeffrey Epstein,
Ghislaine Maxwell, Adam Perry Lang, and Virginia; is
that right?
A.
Yes.
l. And below that, it says, "Reposition."
What does that mean?
A.
We were taking the airplane with no

Probably a charter, I'm

13

access back then that was a private plane?
MR. PAGLIUCA:

THE WITNESS: No. At that point in time
we don't have the Boeing yet.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
O. So how many airplanes did Jeffrey Epstein
18 back then?
19
A.
Well, we -- I don't know if we had the 421
20 then. We may or may not have. But it wouldn't --
21
you know, you wouldn't be flying the 421 down to
22
St. Thomas with Jeffrey. It is too long of a
23
24
25
flight.
O. The Cessna?
A. The Cessna
421, correct.

So then, yes, the answer is, yeah, we
still had the airplane. But we wouldn't have used
that.
Q.
So is there any way of telling how Jeffrey
Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Adam Perry Lang, and
Virginia were in the Virgin Islands on that, from
December 14th, 2000 --

BY MR. EDWARDS:
_Q.
-- based on your knowledge or your logs or

I wouldn't have any way of knowing.

flight that

To your knowledge, did Jeffrey
Epstein ever fly commercially?

Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy

that?
A.
Yes, right.
The 25th it lands in Teterboro. And the
next day, on the 26th, leaves out of Teterboro with
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy Tayler, and
Virginia Roberts.
This time you wrote the whole
name.
A.
Right.
Right.
2. So when you write the full name, does that

Some association with him?

passengers' names?

While I was at school?
Right, while you were at school.

took in the Gulfstream before you began, before yOu
flew the Cessna for a day, I guess, right, from

-- February 3rd --
A.
Yes.
l. And that's the Cessna with 908GM tail
number?

The last flight that you flew on the

And then the next time that you're on the

Do you know why that is?
A.
Yeah. He was the first officer.
Q. Why did he become the first officer?
A .
Because larry was probably in training for
the Boeing.
Okay. You took -- you alternated?
A.
Right.
we didn't go at the same time.
Q. All right.
Then the Gulfstream has the
same aircraft make and model. That's the same

Because we are going to Paris, and so we
16 have to stop there for fuel.

how --I know how you would

In this particular case, you were on

time we landed at Cahokia with passengers on board.
3
O. What was the problem?
4
A. We had a -- we had a static line that had
5
cracked and it was causing our altimeters to not
6
agree.
And then we went to the alternate system,
7
things got really worse because it was stopped up
8
with a mud dauber somewhere in the system. That is
9 why I remember that flight.
10
l. When you landed in St. Louis did the
11 passengers get off the plane?
12
A.
Yes. And then they airlined -- I believe
13
14
they airlined. They could have taken a charter, I
don't recall. But I know they didn't leave with us.
15
All right. And the passengers that got
16
off the plane would have been Jeffrey Epstein,
17
Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy Tayler and Virginia Roberts?

Teterboro?
3
A.
Most of the time. It would depend on the

too.
Like the Boeing, you are not allowed
5
to take it into Teterboro.
6
So while you had the Gulfstream, it seemed
7
like Teterboro?
8
A.
Yeah, it is -- I mean, occasionally there
9 would be a LaGuardia in there, but not really often.
10
So on the 16th, you fly in to Teterboro.
11 And then six days later, it looks like, flight
12
No. 15

A.
Okay.
From Miami to White Plains.
A.
Yes.
Your passengers include Bill Clinton, four
Secret Service.
Did the Secret Service ask that you not
identify them by name?
A.
No.
Q.
Any reason that you didn't identify them
by name?
A.
Didn't know their name.
Two males, one female.
A.
Right.
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah
Kellen and Prince Andrew.
A.
Correct.
Was that your first time meeting Bill
Clinton?
A.
Yes.
At that point, did you have any

Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton or Ghislaine

5
A. No, I didn't have any idea.
6
Q. Had you seen any pictures, prior to that
7
time, of Bill Clinton in any of Jeffrey Epstein's
8
planes or homes?
9
A. Not him I'm
aware of.
10
0. Have you ever seen a picture of Bill
11
Clinton in Jeffrey Epstein's plane?
12
A.
In his plane?
I don't think so.
13
Have you ever seen one in his homes?
14
A. Not that I can recall.
15
okay.
16
A. Oh, wait, wait. Back up. A picture of
17
Bill Clinton in the plane?
Do you mean the picture
18
is on the wall in the airplane or a picture taken of
19 Bill Clinton
on the plane?
20
A picture of Bill Clinton on the wall of
21 the airplane.
22

5
A.
Yes.
6
7
l. Io the best of your knowledge, is that the
first time that Bill Clinton flew with Jeffrey
8
Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell?
9
A.
To the best of my knowledge. It was the
10
first time that we had flown him.
11
Okay. On flight No. 12, which is page 54,
12
March 10th.
13
A. Okay.
14
Q. The Boeing flies from St. Thomas to JFK;
15
is that right?
16
A.
Yes.
17
l. Is there any way of knowing when
the
18
Boeing got to St. Thomas by these logs?
19
A.
Yes, it got there on the 28th.
Because it
20
is trip No. T1 above it. Oh, wait. Oh. Wait.

State
the
question again.
22
Yes,
exactly.
23
Do we know how or when the Boeing got to

St. Thomas? It is leaving out of St. Thomas on

me to land in Palm

3
A.
Correct.

So I'm just missing the kind of connection
5
there.
6
A.
Yes.
Me, too.
7
Okay.
8
A.
Yeah, I don't have an answer for that.
9
Okay. Would
somebody else have flown the
10 Boeing, while you were doing this simulator, the 6th
11 and 7th and 8th?
12
A.
It is possible.
13
That is one possible conclusion, based
14
upon what we have here?
15
A.
That is probably what happened.
16
e. okay.
17
So then March 10th -- sorry. March 10th,
18
you fly to JFK, right?
19
A.
Yes.
20
March 4th, from JFK to Palm Beach. March
21 the 17th, from
Palm Beach back to JFK. And then
22 March 19th, 2002, you fly from JFK to -- where is
23
that?
24
25
A. Luton, London.
And who
are your passengers?

And the next day -- or, sorry, two days
6
later.
7
Do you know where those passengers stayed
8 in London?
9
A.
I have to think about this one second.
10
No, in fact, I don't think they did. Because we
11
didn't spend the night there. We went there. I got
12
to the hotel. As soon as I got to the hotel, I got
13
word from Secret Service that President Clinton
14
wanted to leave that night, so we left that night.
15
So we made it to the hotel, the crew did,
16
but we were there not that long. Two or three
17
hours, four hours, maybe.
18
Do you remember why he wanted to leave
19
that night?
20
A.
No. NO,
because when we went there, we
21 thought we
were
going to be there for like probably
22
at least
couple of nights. But it didn't turn
23
out -- we didn't even
spend one night there.
24
Okay. So does this probably mean that you
25
got there
late at night on the 19th, the early

morning on the 21st?
3
A.
We took off the 19th. So when we land
4
there, it is really the 20th. And probably when we
5
took off there, it is like after midnight or
6
thereabouts.
7
Q. And that is when you fly back to JFK?
8
A.
Back to JFK, yes.
9
Q. And you went there with three Secret
10
Service and came back with 10?
11
A. Yes.
12
13
14
15
Q. How did that happen?
A. Well, there was an advance party waiting
for us when we got there and then when we came back,
they just flew back with us.
16
l. What was the events that you were
17
traveling to London for?
18
A.
I'm not sure. I would imagine, he was

probably giving a speech.

Okay. And you came back with Bill

I don't know. The same way she joined it

flight 96.
14
A.
Okay.

Sorry.
Let's back up to 94.
16
When the Boeing takes off from JFK, do you
17
know sometime during that trip that you are going to
18 be picking up President Clinton?
19
A.
I think so.
Let
me
see.
We went to
20 Paris.
21
Yes,
oh, yes.
We knew that was going to
22
be a long trip.
23
okay.

So we knew at that point in time.
I'm

What did you know about that trip?
3

We knew that was going to be a long trip

because we were going to go around the world.
So when we departed, it was a about a week
6
later, as I recall, that we picked up Clinton. We
7

left JFK on the Ilth, a little less than a week.
Half a week later, we picked up Clinton and from

there, we went to -- Hong Kong.

Great.
All right. Do you know a female by the
name of Ghislaine Maxwell?
A.
Yes.
And when did you first meet Ms. Maxwell?
A.
2001. March probably. End of
February/beginning of March.
Q. And how did you meet her?
A. She approached me while I was on campus at
Palm Beach Atlantic College.
Q. And what happened when she approached you?
A. She asked me if I could tell her how to
find someone that would come and work at her house.
She wanted to know if there was, like, a bulletin
board or something that she could post, that she was
looking for someone to hire.
Q. And what did you discuss with her?
A. I told her where she could go to -- you
know, to put up a listing. And then she asked me if
I knew anyone that would be interested in working
for her.
Q. Did she describe what that work was going
to be?
A.
She explained that she lived in Palm Beach
and didn't want butlers because they're too stuffy.

And so she just liked to hire girls to work at the
house, answer phones, get drinks, do the job a
butler would do.
Q. And did she tell you what she would pay
for that kind of a job?
A. At that moment, no, but later in the day,

recall her or what she looks like or how old she
was.
2.
And what happened next?
A.
And then she asked me if I would be
interested in working for her. And she told me that
she was -- I could trust her and that I could jump
in her car and go check out the house at that moment
if I wanted.
And so I said, Sure, let's do it, and went
to her home with her.
Q. And where was that home?
A. In Palm Beach.
Q. And did she describe that home as being

She and I went -- she wanted to take me
shopping to Worth Avenue, but it was a Sunday and
Nieman Marcus was closed, so we went back to, like,
a little book store. And I remember she bought, I
think, five pairs of reading glasses because she
thought Jeffrey would like them. He had them all
over the house. On every table there was reading
glasses.

remember?
A.
I don't remember how many hours I was
there - I was there. She paid me cash.
So Maxwell paid you?
A.
Yes.
O. And then was she the one who trained you
with what -- with respect to what you were supposed
to do during the day, directed you to, like you
said, go to --
A.
I believe she was the one that was kind of
showing me around.

showing me how to massage.

off. They asked me to get on the table so I could
feel it. Then they both massaged me.
So it was more than a foot massage at that
point?

Yeah, it was mostly, like, legs and back.
Was everybody in the room without clothes
on?

BY MS. McCAWLEY:
0. You can answer.

statement?

Q. And what did -- do you recall what -- when
you observed the other females giving massages, do

clothes?

Normal clothes.

THE WITNESS: I did not know that there
were expectations of me to get the camera until
after. She had purchased the camera for me,
and I was over there giving Jeffrey a massage.
I did not know that she was in possession of
the camera until later.
She told me -- called me after I had left
and said, I have the camera for you, but you
cannot receive it yet because you came here and
didn't finish your job and I had to finish it
for you.
BY MS. MCCAWLEY:
Q. And did you -- what did you understand her
to mean?
A.
She was implying that I did not get
Jeffrey off, and so she had to do it.
e. And when you say "get Jeffrey off," do you
mean bring him to orgasm?

should always act grateful.

girl's virginity?

He did not tell me. He told a friend of
mine.
Q. And what do you recall about that?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, hearsay,

THE WITNESS: He wanted to have a friend
of mine come out who was cardio-kickboxer
instructor. She was a physical trainer.
And so I brought her over to the house,
and he told my friend Rachel that -- he said,
You see that girl over there laying by the
pool? She was 19. And he said, I just took
her virginity. And my friend Rachel was
mortified.

We went to a closet
and grabbed the puppet, the puppet of Prince Andrew.

on the couch, and they put the puppet, the
puppet on her lap.

puppet's hands and put it on Virginia's breast,

exposed her bra, and she grabbed it and pulled it
down.
Q. Anything else?
A. That was the conversation that he had told
her that he had taken this girl's virginity, the
6 girl by the pool.
Q. Okay. Did Maxwell ever say to you that it
takes the pressure off of her to have other girls
around?
A.
She implied that, yes.
In what way?
A.
Sexually.
Q. And earlier Laura asked you, I believe, if
Maxwell ever asked you to perform any sexual acts,
and I believe your testimony was no, but then you
also previously stated that during the camera
incident that Maxwell had talked to you about not
finishing the job.
Did you understand "not finishing the job"
meaning bringing Jeffrey to orgasm?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form.

2. I'm sorry, Johanna, let me correct that
question.
What did you understand Maxwell to mean

BY MS. MCCAWLEY:
Q. And then you mentioned, I believe, when
you were testifying earlier that jeffrey told you a
story about sex on the plane. What was that about?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, hearsay.
THE WITNESS: He told me one time Emmy was
sleeping on the plane, and they were getting
ready to land. And he went and woke her up,
and she thought that meant he wanted a blow
job, so she started to unzip his pants, and he
said, No, no, no, you just have to be awake for

A.
Just that Jeffrey would like to have some
photos of me, and she asked me to take photos of
myself.
Q. What did you say?
A. I don't remember saying no, but I never
ended up following through. I think I tried once.
l. This was the pre-selfie era, correct?
A. Exactly.
2. I want to go back to this: You testified
to two things just now with Sigrid that you said
were implied to you.
A.
Okay.
Q. The first one was it would take pressure
off of Maxwell to have more girls around?
A.
Right.
Q. What exactly did Maxwell say to you that
led you to believe that was her implication?
A.
She said she doesn't have the time or

Do you remember there being a job posting that
you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just
go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your
own?
A
I just talked to Angela.
Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended
to be a full-time job?
A
I don't remember if it was full time or just
summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably
for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal.
I mean, I was there
year round but a lot of
people are seasonal, you know, because it's like
snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to
be down in south Florida.
what would you call the season, the seasonal
aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season?
A
Probably from September or October to, you know,
maybe May, I guess.
Is that the coolest
time?
A
Times of the year, yes.
And it's more guests that come during that
period of time?
A
Yes.
And is there more staff brought on during that
period of time?

we'll call her Angela.
A
We've got to call her something, but, you know,
I didn't
really know what her job title was, but I
was
glad that they would give her a job.
Right.
You know, and that, you know, I was hoping she
would be happy; that way she could, you know, go back and
forth to work with me. She didn't have to drive or
nothing.
A
Did you drive to and from work with her?
Yes. Pretty sure I did, yeah.
Do you remember her
hours being relatively the
I'm pretty sure they were. Yes.
Do you recall her being in school at the same
same as yours?
A
time?
A
in school or not.
No, I don't recall. I don't remember if she was
Is it possible it was over, say, winter break
or --
A
I don't remember. I'm sorry. This is so long
ago. I mean, some things stick in my mind but some things
I just don't remember.
Do you remember whether Virginia wore a uniform?
Yes, I think she did. Yeah. I think everybody

So you don't know if it was a couple days or a
couple weeks or a couple months or a couple years?
Anything
in that
A
Well, it wasn't a couple years. It might have
been two weeks to two months. I don't know. It wasn't a
whole long time, you know.
Where were you when Virginia told you she might
be going to try to get this other job?
A
Probably at work. She might have told me, like,
at lunch or whatever. I don't remember. That was
so many
years ago. I just remember she said Ms. Maxwell was going
to, you know, get her a job with Jeffrey Epstein and learn
massage therapy. And I thought, well, that's great, you
know, because learning new jobs is all about life, you
know.
You've got to learn each -- you know, I've
learned a lot of different things over my lifetime so it's
good to learn every new job you can because that can help
you later in life and that's what I think I told her.
Okay. So the best you can recall today is you
had a conversation with her sometime at lunch perhaps at
Mar-a-Lago where she told you she was going to try to get
another job?
A
Yes. And I thought that was a good thing.
Do you know now that you recall that, what

A
No.
Did she ever call you from that home?
A
Not that I know
of.
Was this when she was still living at home with
you on Rackley Road?
A
Yes. Yes.
Not Rackley Drive.
A
Rackley Road.
Do you know whether Michael was living with you
at Rackley Road at the time or not?
A
I don't think so.
I don't remember. I didn't
care for Michael. Of course, what parent cares for your
daughter's boyfriend.
Why didn't you care for Michael?
A
I didn't think anybody was good enough for my
daughter but that's just me.
I suspect you're right about all fathers.
Do you remember her telling you anything about
what her job with Mr. Epstein was going to be or was?
A
She said it was going to be massage therapy.
Okay. Did she tell you she was getting some
training?
A
Yes.
Did she tell you about the training?
No. She just said she was being trained in

massage therapy.
All right. When she came home at night from
working with Mr. Epstein, did she look distressed to you
in any way?
A
Not that I remember.
• Okay. Did she report any complaints about her
job with Mr. Epstein?
A
Not to me.
Okay. Did she report them to anyone else who
then reported them to you?
A
No.
Your wife, for example?
A
I have no idea. Like I said, if she did tell my
wife, I never heard about it.
Okay. Have you ever met Ms. Maxwell?
A
Not that I remember ever meeting her.
Do you know what she looks like?
No.
Did you ever meet anyone else who worked with
Mr. Epstein?
A
No.
Do you remember anyone else who worked for
Mr. Epstein bringing your daughter home, for example?
A
No.

Okay. But your hours, if I understood you
right, were approximately 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.?
A
Yes.
And Tuesday through Saturday?
A
Yes.
Those hours would be the same time as somebody
her age would have been in high school?
A
Yes.
Okay. So does that -- does that give an
indication to you that the short period of time she was
working was during the summer when there was not school?
A
It seems to be that way.
Okay.
A
I mean, to me, yeah.
It could have been a summer job?
A
Yes, it could have been.
Okay. You would not have, as a father, had her
working somewhere instead of going to school?
A
No, I wouldn't.
And the day that Virginia came and spoke to you
about meeting someone named Ms. Maxwell who was offering
her another job, do you remember the conversation that you
had with Virginia on that day?
A
No, not really. I just remember Virginia saying
that, you know, she met Ms. Maxwell at the spa and that

And there it describes her job at Mar-a-Lago as
lasting from August 2000 to September of 2001. Do you see
that?
A
Yes.
• Does that refresh your memory about how long she
was working there?
MR. EDWARDS: Form.
THE WITNESS: She didn't work that long.
MS. MENNINGER: Okay.
THE WITNESS: Like I say, it was more, like,
a couple of weeks. It wasn't --
BY MS. MENNINGER:
Well, earlier you testified it, might have been
a couple of months?
A
Well, you know, for me, two weeks, two months, I
mean, I don't even remember how long I worked at
Mar-a-Lago. I told you I worked there six years and
according to them, it was, like, three years.
Seemed like
six.
Well, earlier you testified that Mar-a-Lago was
more of a seasonal place, correct?
A
Yes,
well, it is seasonal. But I mean, they
could be open up the spa area during the summer too
because I'm sure a lot of people in Palm Beach come to get
massages and things like that. I mean, you know, the only

part they close off is where the chefs and all that, where
they didn't do any more big events and stuff.
Okay.
A
But I think the kitchen was still open.
I mean,
they had a dining room.
So if she didn't work there that long
August 2000 -- even though August is in the summer -- it
would not be unusual in your mind?
A
No.
Okay. So she could have started working in
August of 2000, correct?
A
She could have, yeah.
And while you don't think she worked all the way
until September of 2001 --
A
No.
-- that would be consistent with your
recollection of it being more seasonal in the fall,
September --

October, something like that, that seems likes
that

MS. EZELL: I'm going to ask -- I don't know
whether you've still been serially designating
Exhibits or whether we're doing them separately for
deposition.
MR. CRITTON: I think we cannot trust that
people will do them serially. I'd do them with
each one.

MS. EZELL: Then would you mark this, please,
as Exhibit 1 to this deposition.
And I'm just going to state on the record that
I will keep that original. We will not attach it
to the deposition.
(Exhibit number 1 was marked for
identification purposes and retained by Counsel for the
Plaintiffs.)
THE WITNESS: Yes, that's --
BY MS. EZELL:
Q. Can you identify that -- the young woman in
those pictures?
A. Yes.
Q. Who is it?
A. That's V. -- V. Now that you says R., that
is V.R. definite, a hundred percent.
MR. CRITTON: Let me just note my objection,

deposition, that I know you're going to confiscate
Exhibit number 1. I think it's inappropriate. I
think I should be allowed to have a copy of
Exhibits that are being used in deposition. But
I'll file a motion with the Court so we don't get
into a pulling match over your Exhibits.

MR. BERGER: I would ask that the court
reporter initial that.

MS. EZELL: Sure.

Oh, you did?
10
MR. WILLITS: She marked it.
11
MR. BERGER: Did she put her initials or did
12
she just put a number or a letter?
13
MR. CRITTON: She's nodding that she did
14
everything that she usually does, which means,
15
initials, date and number.
16
MR. MERMELSTEIN: You can talk.

MR. WILLITS: But when you talk, use your

initials.

BY MS. EZELL:
20
Q. How old did you think V.R. was at the time she
21
began coming to Mr. Epstein's home?
22
A. She could have been 17, 18, 19.
23
Q. Could she have also been 15?
24
MR. CRITTON: Form.

THE WITNESS: Could have been. But, you know
I am not -- I don't think I am a very good judge of
ages. If you ask me how old you are, I really
couldn't tell you.
MR. CRITTON: Kathy thinks she's 25.
MS. EZELL: In my dreams.
THE WITNESS: Now, again, I must tell you, I
was never told to check any i.d.s on any of the
people who work at the house.
BY MS. EZELL:
Q. I understand that. And, so, I think I'm just
trying to establish that you didn't consider it part of
your job description to worry about or consider the
ages --
A. No.
Q. - of the young women that came there?
A. Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
Q. And, so, you never really focused on that or
particularly thought about it if they seemed young?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: I don't -- I didn't see that
many young girls, you know, young, underage girls
at the house. I never saw except the two girls
that I mentioned that I think it was underage was
N. for sure because she was still in high school.
Page 48
And she -- she had dinner with her mother, a couple
times with her mother. And she become an actress.
She's an actress and she has done movies. And he
help her in her career.
That's the only girl that I knew she was young
because she was going to high school and I pick her
up from high school sometimes. But she was not a
massage therapist. She will go for dinner. And
they will go for the movies and she sang sometimes
because she was a singer. So she sung at the
house. Beautiful girl. Very talented.
That's the only girl that I know that it
was -- I would says, underage.
BY MS. EZELL:
Q. Okay. Did -- who told you that V.R. was a
massage therapist?
A. Nobody.
Q. Did you assume that she was a massage
therapist because you were told she was coming to give a
massage?
A. No. I assumed she was a massage therapy
because I was -- I drove Ms. Maxwell to Mar-a-lago,
Donald Trump's residence. And I wait in the car while
Ms. Maxwell got a -- I think it was a facial or massage.
I don't know. But that day I remember this girl, V.,

walking down from the main lobby towards the spa of
Mar-a-lago. And I was driving Ms. Maxwell up, up the
ramp. It's a little ramp there.
And Ms. Maxwell says, stop. And she went and
talked to -- she went inside.
And that afternoon around 5:00 I saw V. came.
She came to the house already, so she was there already.
That was the first day I knew. And then she would come
regularly.
Q. Did you ever meet any of V.'s family?
A. No. I think she was -- one time I think her
father drove her there. And I met -- I don't know if it
was the boyfriend or husband or -- but he had to wait,
make him wait outside while she was at the house.
Q. Do you know the name or recognize the name
Tony Santiago?
A. I think it was him.
Q. That was her --
A. I know he had an old beat-up car, Camaro or
Mustang. I know it was very old car that I make him
wait on the street one time. I make him come out of the
driveway because we have to move some cars around.
Q. Did there ever come a time when Tony Santiago
was welcome in the kitchen?
A. I think he came once in the kitchen, but

Ms. Maxwell told me to get him out.
1
Q. Did she tell you why?
2
A. No. She didn't -- I guess she didn't want to
3
become, you know, everybody -- because some of these
4
people came with their husbands and they wait outside
5
And I guess she didn't want this to become a norm for
6
everybody to bring their companions while they have --
7
they will do a massage for her.
8
Q. During the time you were there, did you ever
9
know of Tony Santiago bringing any other girls to
10
Mr. Epstein?
11
A. No. I knew that sometimes I saw V. bring
12
other girls with her, not Tony Santiago.
13
Q. Do you remember the names of any of those
14
girls -
15
A. No, I don't.
16
Q. -- that V. brought?
17
A. That was at the end of my stay there. No.
18
That was a very -- at the very end of the last month of
19
my stay.
20
Q. Did you give -- I don't believe I asked you,
21
but if I did, forgive me. Did you give us an
22
approximate year in which you were taking Ms. Maxwell to 23
Mar-a-lago and saw V.R. for the first time?
24
A. That was at the -- at the end of my stay
25
Page
51
there. So I would says, between three months maybe
before I left. And I think I left at the end of the
year, so it could have been -- I remember it was a very
hard day because I had to wait in the sun outside in a
convertible and I was dying, waiting for an hour for
Ms. Maxwell. I think it was in the summer of 2002.
Q. And if 1 remember correctly, you left in
November or December of 2002?
A. Yes.
Q. So that might have been perhaps July or August
of 2002?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. And, so, as I understand it, you only saw V.R.
come to that house during the last three months of your
time at Mr. Epstein's?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you have any -- any sense or can you
approximate how many times she came?
A. I cannot give you a number, but I would says,
two, three times a week.
Q. You mentioned that sometimes you would have to
call these massage therapists in the middle of the
night. Did you ever have to call V. for Mr. Epstein in
the middle of the night?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
Page 52
THE WITNESS: No. No.
BY MS. EZELL:
Q. Did there come a time while you were there
that V.R. stayed in the house?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: I don't think so. I cannot
remember. No.
BY MS. EZELL:
Q. How many bedrooms were there upstairs?
A. One, two, three -- one, two, three, four --
four - so that would be five, five bedrooms.
Q. Five. And, so, would one have been
Mr. Epstein's bedroom?
A. Yes. His quarters was big, huge quarters.
Q. Sort of a suite?
A. Yeah. And he has -- this is the room. His
bathroom was here and her bathroom was here. The mair
room was here. And we have -- it was two sets of doors
before -- two sets of double doors before you can go
into the suite. There was one on top of the stairway
and one in the middle of the hallway. And then you walk
into the -- into the suite.
Q. Okay. And you -- you just put a red eight by
11 folder in front of you?
A. Yeah.

Q. Do you know, was Sarah Kellen ever one of the
massage therapists before she became an assistant?
7
A. I don't know if she was a massage therapist.
8
I don't remember setting up a massage table for her. I
9
think she was an assistant. And she would call -- at
10
the end of my stay, I was -- tried to pull aside from my
11
obligations and Sarah was doing all the phone calls and
12
all the arrangement and all the looking out for these
13
girls for the -- for massage therapists. They were
14
constantly.
15
Q. When did that role get transferred from you to
16
Ms. Maxwell, the role of looking after girls and calling
17
the girls?
18
A. I didn't look after -- out for girls.
19
Ms. Maxwell was the one that recruit -- I remember one
20
occasion or two occasions she would says to me, John,
21
give me a list of all the spas in Palm Beach County.
22
And I will drive her from one to the other one to PGA
23
and Boca. And she will go in, drop credit cards -- not
24
credit cards, but business cards, and she come out. And
25
Page 58
then we go to -- she will recruit the girls. Was
never -- never done by me or Mr. Epstein or anybody
else, that I know.
I don't know about Sarah because Sarah was
there at the last, last -- probably last weeks of my
1
2
3
4

stay there. So I cannot say anything about Sarah.
Q. Was there any point in time -- well, let me
ask you this way: Did -- you said sometimes you would
call the girls to come --
A. Uh-huh.
Q. -- to give them massage. And sometimes

entirely from you --

Q.
- or that continued -
17
A.
That's continued
18
Q. - until you left?
19
A. Yeah.
20
Q. Do you remember, is Jeffrey Epstein godfather
21
to one of the Dubin children?
22
A. I don't know if he godfather. I don't
23
remember that. But he was very fond to these children,
24
the children.
25
Page 59
Q. And they called him uncle, you said?
A. They called him uncle
Q. Did you ever learn what Tony Santiago did for
a living?
A. No.
Q. Have you had any occasion to see him since the
time you left Mr. Epstein's employ?
A. No.
Q. And you don't -- do you have any idea where he
is?
A. Ihave no idea.
I remember an incident, one
time the -- I went to pick her up at Royal Palm Beach
and she was crying and I went and knock at the door and
she was crying. And she says, well, -- I think it was
Tony or -- because she used to live with these other
guys, too. There were two guys and her or two couples
I don't know the arrangements there. But I remember
that she told me the -- Tony or her boyfriend had got
mad and ripped the furniture, he cut the furniture in
pieces and he even broke the screens. Because I was ..
when I went into to knock the door, the screen was all
ripped up like it was cut.
And she told me that he got mad at -- I don't
know what happened. I never saw him in there.
Q. Did she tell you he had hit her or beaten her
Page 60
at all?
MR. CRITTON: Is the she, V., V.R.?
MS. EZELL: Yes. Thank you.
BY MS. EZELL:

Ms. Maxwell's albums?

were there any hidden cameras?

left, correct?

A. Yeah.
Q. You stated that Ms. Maxwell was very hard on
you and you got blamed for everything, and that you -
you liked the job and you liked Mr. Epstein, but you
didn't like working for Mrs. Maxwell?
A. That's correct.
l. Can you tell me why, other than that she
blamed you for everything?
A.
She came from a very wealthy family and she
was -- just my opinion; I give my personal opinion --
that she was rotten spoiled and she tried to drive the
house like a palace and not a home.
I was -- I discussed it with her, many, many
times we have discussions. And sometimes I even refuse
to do her orders, knowing that I was going to be backed
up by Mr. Epstein or do the right thing, my thinking of
running the house should be. But we never had a good
relationship at all from the beginning, I don't think
so. But I was -- have to be her driver and she will go
and shop all over the malls and I will have to go behind
her, pay for it and bring the bags to the car.
Next day or the same day she will do shopping
and buy and say, John, go to this store and get it. It
was a lot of work. It was a lot that she created and

most of this jobs that she created.
l. And one of those things you also had to do
with her was
to take her to different spas?
A. Yes.
Q. And there she would recruit young women to
come and do massages?
A.
Because she was English. And she didn't know
the area too much as well as I knew. So she -- she
says, John, make a list of all the massage -- the spas
in the area from Jupiter to Boca Raton. And we went to
all the main spas. And then we went to the schools for
massage therapists, and all the massage parlors, and
massage, the small massage.
So I make a list from the telephone book and
we would go from one to the another one. I would wait
in the car and she goes
in.
And sometime she took a couple minutes and
walk out with cards, business cards. And that -- she
did the recruiting.
And from then, she pick up the girls and that
was the end of it. I never did any recruiting and I
never really saw him doing it.
You really never saw?
A.
Never saw Mr. Epstein recruiting anybody.

Q. Okay. So, I assume then that your wife
that you are separated from I guess at the time, she
didn't come down to Palm Beach?
A. No, no.
Q. And this is somebody who still lives
somewhere other than Florida?
A.
Correct.
So, you came down in February 2005 and
began working. What did you, what did you first
start doing for Jeffrey Epstein?
A. First I doing? I don't remember nothing
special.
Q. Okay. Well, were you working -- I will
rephrase it. Were you working only for Jeffrey
Epstein or were you working also for Ghislaine
Maxwell, the other person who interviewed you, or
anybody else in the house?
A.
I guess only for him because she was visiting
a few times house, but I am employed by him.
Okay. What was your understanding at that
time as to the relationship between Ghislaine
Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein?
A.
They were like partners in business.
okay. What business was that, if you

A. I don't know what kind of business but she was
the one who organized I would say employment with this
organization. So, whatever I need, if I have some kind
of problem, I contact her. She was the one who decided
what I have to answer my problems with, what I was
supposed to do.
Q. How many times did you have problems where
you had to go through her?
A.
Well, not big problems. Just a question of
what certain, how to do certain things. For example,
what kind of flowers I have to buy, what kind of things
he likes, what time I supposed to serve him coffee in
the mornings, sort of organizing things.
Q. Those are things that you wouldn't ask
Jeffrey Epstein directly?
A. No, no. He doesn't like those things to ask
him directly. He would like to prefer either through
his assistant or like I say, Ghislaine Maxwell.
Q. Is that still the same today?
A.
Yes, still the same. Unless, something happen
that I need to, nobody is around and I need to urgently
contact him, I go to him directly.
e.
So, for the most part if you have a
question or at least -- let's go back to 2005, you
had a question about what needed to be done in the

A When I came back to report, that's how I
learned.
Q Elaborate on that for me. What do you mean,
when you came back to report that's how I learned?
A I reported in the afternoon, and then that's
how I learned that the police came.
Q All right. And when were you -- you're now
saying you came back to report and you learned that the
police had already come to the house, right?
Q Prior to that occasion, when was the previous
time that you were at the house?
A The day before.
• Okay. And the day before you left your shift
at roughly five o'clock?
A I cannot remember. I usually leave 5:00 or
5:30.
Q But sometime late in the afternoon?
A Yes.
Q And as of that time, the day before the search
warrant was issued, you had seen no police officers in
or around the house?
A No.
Q And then the next day you reported to the job
at what time?
82
A The next day?
Q The next day.
A I report in the afternoon.
Q Was there a reason why you reported in the
afternoon?
A Ms. Maxwell called me.
Q When did she call you?
A During that day, she said Louella, you can
report in the afternoon.
Q She called you early in the morning?
A Not early.
Q Normally you would report to the house between
eight and nine o'clock, right?
A Yes, sir.
• So in order for you not to arrive at the
house, she had to have called you before eight or
nine o'clock, right?
A Yes.
Q Okay. So approximately what time does
Ms. Maxwell call you to tell you you can report to the
house later on that day?
A I cannot remember really the time.
• Okay. What time did you actually report to
the house?
A After lunch, about - maybe after lunch.

Doe right here on the copy you gave me. Im
missing which Jane Doe this is.
They're all different case numbers. Do
you want me to go through each case number?
MR. CRITTON: I'm going to note my
objection. Obviously if this deposition
gets played -- not obviously, I'm going to
object to the litany of each one so I don't
know how we can separate it out. Maybe if
and when at the time of trial and depending
on how the Court determines what comes in
and what doesn't with regard to the
consolidated aspects of this. I have no
great idea other than just saying Jane Doe
versus Epstein, et al, or something like
that, or Jane Doe, et al.
MS. EZELL: Couldn't we just say and
those cases which have been consolidated
with it for Discovery purposes?
MR. EDWARDS: Although there is cases
here that have cross noticed this from state
court that haven't been consolidated so that
may not work. You may have to read them
all, if it works out your way that will just
get edited out, at least he will have read
that caption, every caption. Right? Is
there a better suggestion?
MR. CRITTON: No. There may be a better
suggestion if he starts this is such and
such day, it's the deposition of Mr.
Rodriguez in the case such and such, and we
can almost fill it in depending on which
tape it goes, how it fills in, at least
we'll have the context of the first and
depending on whether the Judge reads it in
from a consolidated or they all come
related, I have no great idea.
MR. EDWARDS: I was thinking if he read
every one of them and it was the seventh in
line then you just would edit it so you
would only read that one.
-MR. CRITTON: I'm okay with that too...
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: On page number three
there is something missing on the top here.
Do you want me to read each case number
separately?
MR. MERMELSTEIN: I don't think it's
necessary.
MR. EDWARDS: I don't think it's
necessary either.

answer the phone?
A. Yes.
Q. I'm sorry, what would you do --
A. I would leave it on the counter next to

in cash as opposed to check?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: I was told to pay them
cash, sir.
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
Simply you were told and didn't ask why?
A.
No.
Q.
Do you recall telling the detective who
interviewed you for the police that you thought of
yourself as a human ATM machine?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
Q. You recall saying that?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Because I always had cash
in my pocket.
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
Q. And why was there always cash in your
pocket?
That was part of my job to have, you
know, for emergencies or paying somebody cash.
Q. Okay. What kind of emergencies?
A. It's hard to say. I was supposed to put
cash on each Mercedes Benz on each ashtray. The
Page 71
1
idea behind this is you get stranded nobody accept
credit card or check you have cash.
Q. How much did you leave in the ashtray?
4
5
A. 300.
Q. And did you ever have to replenish that
money?
A. Yes.
Q. Because the Mercedes was stranded?
A. No, because when Mr. Epstein will leave I
10
have to collect that money because I will send the
11
cars to the car wash so to avoid that money being
12
stolen we used to keep track, you know, when to
13
retrieve that money and then when he's coming put
14 it back there again.
15
Q. So you use cash for that purpose and you
16 also use cash to pay the masseuses. Correct?
17
A. Yes.
18
Q. Did you use cash for any other purpose?
19
À. Car wash for the guy who used to came to
20
the house and wash all the cars. Tipping
21
sometimes for getting a good spot in the
22
restaurant you have to have cash, something like
23 that.
24
Q. Okay. Would you drive Mr. Epstein to a
25 restaurant?

A. Not him. I will drive anybody else but
he would rather eat at home.
Q. So you would drive house guests to
restaurants?
A. Yes.
Q. And when you did that you would -- didn't
you stay with the car or did you eat with them?
A. No, I will stay with the car.
Q. So who did you tip?
A. If you want to park in front of the
restaurant you got to tip the valet otherwise
you're taking one of the spots.
Sometimes I used to take -- I'm sorry.
Aviation, you know, you need to go to aviation and
help those guys move your cars around, you need -
they carry luggage, so I used to tip those too.
Q. That would be when you picked up or
dropped off Mr. Epstein. Correct?
A. Yes.
MR. MERMELSTEIN: We'll mark this as an
exhibit, composite exhibit.
(Composite Exhibit 1 was marked for
Identification.)
MR. CRITTON: Just out of curiosity, on
depositions are we going to use instead of
Page 73

2
3
doing plaintiff and defendant designations
do you just want to run them one, two,
three, four?
MR. MERMELSTEIN: That's fine with me as
5
long as we remember where we left off.
MR. CRITTON: Well, are we going to do it
consecutive with all of the depositions?
I'm okay with that if someone can keep track
9
of that.
10
MR. EDWARDS: I've had that go wrong
11
before, especially when we have some parties
12
who aren't here, such as Mr. Garcia, he's
13
going to join depositions, we have to start
14
at 27 or whatever.

MR. CRITTON: For each deposition one

through whatever without necessarily giving
17
them a plaintiff or defendant.

composite document which includes four per page of
21
what appear to be message slips.
22
First of all let me ask you, let me
23
direct your attention to the first page of this

at the bottom. Is that correct?

A.
Yes.
Q. Are those your initials?
A.
Yes.
Q. And was it the household policy to
initial messages when they were taken?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. You were instructed to do that?
A.
Yes.
Q. Who instructed you to do that?
A. Ms. Maxwell. There was a manual, sir, in
the house, we had to follow the instructions of
the manual.
Q. There was -- okay.
A.
Estate manager, household manager for all
the houses, so I will abide to that, you know, so
I take message with my initial, the time, who
called.
Q. So there were all sorts of policies and
procedures in this manual?
A. Yes.
Q. Who wrote it?
A. It was the estate manager for all the
properties and so I was --
Q. Who was the estate manager for all the
properties?
and he told you he owned a modeling agency?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Anything else he told you?
4
A. He spoke, you know, five, six languages,
5
always speaking Spanish, Italian.
6
Q. Did the girls who were -- you know, who
7
travelled with Mr. Epstein, were they from his
8
agency?
9
MR. CRITTON: Form.
10
THE WITNESS: I don't know, sir.
11
12
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
Q. You didn't discuss that?
13
A. No.
14
Q. Let's look at the message next to it.
15
MR. CRITTON: Still on page one?
16
MR. MERMELSTEIN: Still on page one.
17 BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
18
Q. It appears the one under it is to the
19 same person. Is that correct? Who is that?
20
A. Alicia.
21
Q. Who is Alicia?
22
A. I don't know, sir. Please tell Jeffrey
23
that I called so I just wrote the name.
24
Q. Now, some of these messages if you look
25
through appears to be a different handwriting and
Page 75
Page 77
A. I never met him, sir, he was fired before
I came along.
Q. But you don't remember his name?
A. No, sir.
Q. And you remember one of the things that
said in this manual was that every message has to
be signed?
Yes.
Q. I'm not necessarily going to go through
every single message. Let me go back to the one
on the upper left on the first page. It's from
Jean-Luc. Is that correct?
A.
Yes, sir.
Q. Who is Jean-Luc?
A. He had modeling agency.
. How do you know that?
. He gave me his card, sir.
Q. Was he a frequent guest at the house?
A.
Yes, sir.
Q. Did he stay over?
A. Sometimes he will stay, sometimes 1 Will
drive him to Miami.
Q. Do you recall his last name?
A. No, sir.
Q. And so you had a conversation with him
1
2
there is no signature on the bottom.
A.
That's not mine, I don't know who's that
is, sir.
Q. I thought you said earlier you were the
one who was responsible for taking messages.
6
A. Exactly, yes, I was, sir.
Q. But there were other people who took
messages as well?
A. Maybe this is after or before my time,
10
sir.
11
Q. Okay. Because there is no date on it.
A. I used to put my dates and I know I used
13 to do that all the time, but you know.
14
Q. These style of message pads. It was a
15 pad. Correct?
16
A. Yes.
Q. And this is the old fashion message pad
18 that it's like duplicate?
A. Exactly, the original stays with the
20 spiral.
21
Q. Okay. So there was a spiral notebook?
22
23
Q. And you would write the message on the
24 top copy and then you would take that out and put
25
it on the counter in the kitchen?

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
5
Q. Okay. There were photographs of naked
6
women?
7
A. Models.
8
Q. And why do you say models?
9
A. Because it was like a catalog so you have
10
models, you know.
11
Q. And what was your understanding as a
12
source of these photos?
13
I don't know, sir. It was just a
14
curiosity on myself and it was -- it was none of
15
my business but, you know, I just happen to see
16
them there.
17
Q. Did these girls appear very young to you?
18
MR. CRITTON: Form.
19
THE WITNESS: No, sir. They were young
20
but not underage.
21
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
22
Is there anything in particular that
23
makes you draw that conclusion?
24
A. Because they are developed, you know.

9
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
10
11
Q. And how would that come about, were you
given instructions to call a cab by anyone?
12
A. No, I would call the cab, the taxi.
13
Q. How did you know a cab needed to be
14
called?
15
A. Because Sarah would tell me can you get
16
me a taxi.
17
Q. So when the girl was finished what she
18
was doing Sarah would come to you and say --
19
A. She would call me.
20
MR. CRITTON: Form.
21
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:
22
Q. She would call you?

10
equipment in the master bedroom?
11
A. No, sir.
12
Q. The models that you saw on the computer,
13
did you recognize any of them as having been at
14 the house?
15
A. No.
Q. The girls who stayed at the house, did
17 any of them speak with a foreign accent?

written down anywhere?
A. No.
Q. It's my understanding that C. and T.
either came to his house alone to visit with Mr.
Epstein or brought other girls in their age group
to Mr. Epstein.
Were you familiar with that type of
recruitment process of girls bringing other girls?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Can you tell me more about what you know
about girls bringing other girls that are
relatively the same age to come to Jeffrey
Epstein's house and to use your words, have a good
time?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: It's hard to know who they
knew. But I think that was -- they feel
better themselves when they're in a group
than going by themselves, but I don't know
somebody recruiting.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Okay. And you've talked about, at least
referred to yourself I believe to the police and
Page 167
as well today as a human ATM machine. Right?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Something like that. I was
supposed to carry cash at all times.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. One of the primary reasons why you
carried cash was to pay the girls in this age
group of C. and T. for whatever happened at the
house. Right?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. That's a fair statement. Right?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. Okay. And when C., let's use her for
example, would bring somebody else to the house,
did you pay C. as well as whomever she brought to
the house, pay them both?
A. No, I pay only one person.
Q. Okay. My understanding, and tell me if
this is wrong or you can corroborate this, is that
Mr. Epstein would pay the girl that was actually
performing whatever was happening in the room -

for now we'll call it a massage -- as well as
anybody who brought that person over to the house,
they would both get paid cash. Are you familiar
with that?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. If C. brought another girl over to the
house and C. stayed downstairs but this other girl
went upstairs with Mr. Epstein, which one would
you pay?
A. I don't know because I was told who to
pay.
Q. And Sarah Kellen always told you?
A. Sarah told me pay so and so.
Q. So if we were going to ask anybody else
about the exact method in terms of who would get
paid and for what, who would the people be? I
mean, other than Mr. Epstein who else could we ask
these questions?
A. Sarah.
Q. Sarah Kellen?
A. Yes.
Q. She would know this?
A. Yes.

have a good time?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
11
THE WITNESS: I have to say something.
12
Mrs. Maxwell called me and told me not to
13
ever discuss or contact her again in a
14
threaten way.
15 BY MR. EDWARDS:
16
Q. When was this?
17
A. Right after I teft because I call one of
18 the friends for a job and she told me this, but,
19 you know, I feel intimidated and so I want to keep
20 her out.
Q. What exactly did she say? First of all,
22 was this a telephone call?
23
24
A. Yes, she was in New York.
0. She called you on your cell phone?

Q. Okay. Have you ever spoken with an
investigator Paul Lavery?
A. Could be, I'm not sure.
Q. Okay. So Bill Riley came by your house
personally?
A. Yes.
Q. And how long did you meet with him?
A. Five minutes. He gave me his card, he
gave me Mr. Critton telephone number, he said
don't talk to Mr. Goldberger.
Q. Did he tell you why you should call Mr.
Critton?
A. No. I assume that he was not on the case
anymore, but I didn't ask questions but --
Q. You assumed that who wasn't on the case
anymore?
A. Mr. Goldberger, Jack Goldberger.
Q. Okay. But what I'm asking you, I guess,
is did this investigator, Mr. Riley, tell you why
it was important for you to call any attorney
that's associated with Mr. Epstein, why was that
Page 251
important?
He didn't say that. He didn't say that.
He just said that get in touch and that's it.
Because I said what am I going to do, because I
said I thought this was -- you know, but I didn't
know I was going to be subpoena.
And like I said
7
in the beginning of this deposition, I don't have
8
an attorney so I don't have money, first of all,
9
to pay for an attorney. First of all, I don't
10
think I'm in trouble, but every time you hear high
11
powered lawyers you feel intimidated so I said,
12
listen, what am I going to do, and that was my
13
basic question,
Q. Okay. So then you spoke with somebody at
15 Mr. Critton's office and arranged to meet with him
16
personally?
17
A. Yes. I catted his secretary and we sit
18
down with his assistant, the three of us.
19
20
Q. So it was Mr. Critton, yourself, and
somebody else?
21
A. Yes.
22
Q. And you sat down for another two hour
23
period of time?
24
A. Yes.
25
Q. And what did you go over in that meeting?
Page 252
-NM
A. We discuss -- he asked me a lot of
questions, obviously he didn't know a lot of
things about the case, and I told him who I was,
what I did in the house.
Q. He told you he didn't know a lot about
A. No, no, no. He asked me questions about
8
so I got the feeling that Mr. Critton didn't know
9
as much as other lawyers.
10
Q. Okay. Did you tell him what you told us
11
here today?
12
A. No. He asked me tell the truth, you
13
know, just go over there, you know, he advise me
14
like you're on your own, Alfredo, just tell the
15
truth, you know. He didn't give me any advice.
16
He paid for my gas. Thank you very much.
17
And that's it, you know.
18
The main thing I wanted to have a lawyer
19
on my side but then I keep going to the first
20
instance when my wife told me you don't need a
21
lawyer, and I'm here today to say that, I'm here,
22
I'm speaking the truth.
23
Q. Okay. You mentioned there were five or
24
six computers in the house?
25
A. Yes.
Page 253

Q. And do you know what happened to the
computers?
A.
No.
Q. You don't know where they are?
A. (Shakes head.)

Q. You also mentioned there were photographs

in the house?

A. In the computers in the files.
11
12
Q. Okay. But there were also still
photographs around the house?
13
A. Oh yes, yes.

Q. Some of the girls have made the

allegation that there were photographs of them

18 one frame with probably 15 pictures, small

similar to the allegations that C. and T. have

made, which is that they were underage when Mr.

Q. Do you know if she kept pictures of the
girls on the computer?

Q. And you know that as well because you
happen to see them?
A.
Yes, ma'am.
MR. CRITTON: Form to the last two
questions.
BY MS. EZELL:
Q. Were they similar to the pictures that
Ms. Kellen had on her computer?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, ma'am.
BY MS. EZELL:
Q.
Did the pictures that they kept there
look like pictures that were posed?
A. They were more casual.
Q. Did they look as though the person being
photographed knew that they were being
photographed?

Q. And what can you tell me about that, what

lead you to draw that conclusion?
5
A. They were probably taken in parties in

big reception or banquet.
7
MR. CRITTON: Let me offer as a
8
suggestion, not that you have to accept or
9
that you would, you're using the term young
girls generically, he has probably seen
many, many young girls, there was no --
you've used it interchangeably with just
young girls versus young girls who may have
come to -- purported to give a massage and,
therefore, that may be a different answer,
so that's part of my form objection.
MS. EZELL: Okay, thank you.
BY MS. EZELL:
Q. When I asked you about Ms. Kellen whether
she had a list of the girls and telephone numbers,
I think I asked about those girls that came to
give massages, but let me go back and just ask it
Did you notice that Ms. Kellen had a list
of the girls that came to give massages on her
1
computer?
2
MR. CRITTON: Form.
3
THE WITNESS: Yes, ma'am.
4 BY MS. EZELL:
Q. And did she generally have phone numbers

A. Yes, ma'am.

Q. And were they generally pictures of the
9 girls?

MR. CRITTON: Form.

Q. And were those pictures the more casual
ones that you described when I asked whether or
not the subject looked as though she knew she was
being photographed?
MR. CRITTON: Form.
9
THE WITNESS: I'm sorry, can you repeat?
BY MS. EZELL:
10
Q. Yeah. The pictures of the young girls
11
who came to the house to give massages that were
12
on Ms. Maxwell's computer, did they appear to have
13
been taken when the girls knew they were being
14 photographed?
15
MR. CRITTON: Form.

THE WITNESS: I don't think they knew
17
they were being photographed.

international commercial dimensions of the sex trafficking scheme recounted by Ms. Giuffre. It
is both factually and legally correct to characterize what Ms. Giuffre experienced as
victimization in a sex trafficking conspiracy.
Conclusion 4
Virginia Roberts Giuffre's account appears credible and consistent in its most salient parts
with the testimony of other witnesses and with contemporary trends in U.S. sex trafficking.
The description of exploitation recounted by Ms. Giuffre, while not the most common
sex trafficking scenario (many cases involve even more brutal forms of pimp-driven prostitution)
nonetheless is quite consistent with larger patterns of commercial sexual exploitation. The
conspiracy in this case was premised upon the exploitation of minors and young women who
seem to have had certain identifiable vulnerabilities that rendered them prone to exploitation.
The criminal scheme that emerges from the depositions and police reports involved a very
calculated pattern of recruiting, grooming, and an attempt to "normalize" the repeated
exploitation of its victims.
While the accounts of witnesses vary in some of their details, the essential elements of a
sex trafficking conspiracy clearly emerge when viewed in the totality of the circumstances that
are recounted in the case record. Ms. Giuffre refers to herself at times as a "sex slave." This is
not factually incorrect, given her experiences, though current U.S. law might prefer to
characterize her as a victim of sex trafficking. Popular understandings of the term "sex slave"
might still connote images of violent pimps, white slavery, or of victims chained to a bed in a
brothel in the minds of some people. To call Ms. Giuffre a victim of sex trafficking would
however very accurately convey the reality that she along with a great many other victims of
contemporary forms of slavery are often exploited by the "invisible chains" of fraud and
psychological coercion.

question:
In providing my expert opinion, I have been asked to respond to the following
What is the dissemination of the statements from Ms. Maxwell referring to
Ms. Giuffre's declarations as "untrue" and "lies" from when the statements were made on 2
January 2015 to the date that I filed this report?
9.
For brevity, I refer to references to the statements denoting Ms. Giuffre's
declarations as "untrue" and "lies", any related accounts referring to those original statements, or
similar statements from Ms. Maxwell or her representatives referring to Ms. Giuffre as the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, the statements from Ms. Maxwell's message, or the message
from Mr. Gow'.
10.
My analysis is based on my experience, training, knowledge, and education and is
formed through the application of that experience, training, knowledge, and education in the
principles of web data collection, web analytics, web search, search engines, web sites, web traffic
analysis, and related market analysis.

IV.
SUMMARY OF OPINIONS
12.
Based on my research and analysis in connection with this assignment, which is
described in more detail in the body of this report, along with my own experience, training,
knowledge, and education as stated below, I have reached the following opinion:
13.
The statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to at least
115 online media or other sites in 178 separate stories or articles with a combined
66,909,965 potential unique visitors since 2 January 2015 to the date that I filed this report,
inclusive.
14.
This is a conservative estimate, and it is more likely than not, the statements made
by Ms. Maxwell against Ms. Giuffre have received wider dissemination due to factors such as:
a.
I used a set of online websites to measure dissemination, and it is
reasonable that I have not located all references to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre on
every website by the time of the submission of this report.
b.
I examined only online sources referencing the statements made against
Ms. Giuffre and not print or broadcast media dissemination of the statements made against Ms.
Giuffre.
c.
I have not attempted to measure face-to-face dissemination of articles
containing the statements against Ms. Giuffre.
d.
I do not have access to certain online sources where articles containing the
statements against Ms. Giuffre may have been disseminated (e.g., email messages, personal
social media messages, articles behind firewalls, etc.).
e.
There are possibly sites that have hosted the statements made against Ms.
Giuffre that I could not locate or where the statements have been removed.


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page407 of 883
f.
There are sites that hosted the articles containing the statements made
against Ms. Giuffre where the visitor data is not accessible or where I could not confirm the
number of visitors.
g.
I did not consider the dissemination via social media platforms of articles
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.
h.
Many sites published multiple articles on multiple days that contained or
referenced the statements made against Ms. Giuffre; however, I did not include these multiple
publication dates in calculating unique daily visitors.
i.
I did not include unique daily visitors to articles that link from that article
to one or more of the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.
j.
Finally, I did not include the counts of those who may have been searching
and seen the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the search results listing.
V.
BACKGROUND WEB ANALYTICS FOR TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
15.
In the course of forming this opinion, I implemented numerous web analytics and
related techniques commonly used in the industry. In order to more clearly discuss these
techniques, I define the following terms:
Direct Traffic: visitors to a website that come from entering a website link
into a browser location bar (e.g., not coming via a link on another website).
Dissemination: the act of spreading or the circulation of information or
articles.
•
Domain: a specific Internet website that are administered as a unit and
defined by an Internet Protocol (IP) address.


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page408 of 883
Reach: the percentage or number of people who visit a website out of the
total targeted population.
Referral Traffic: visitors to a site that come from websites other than
search engines.
•
Repeat Visits: visitor traffic to a website in a given period that just includes
multiple visits from the same set of IP addresses (i.e., IP addresses with more than one visit;
provides a count of the people who have visited a site more than once in a given period. An
individual is usually defined by a combination of IP address and browser within a given period but
can also be defined by more sophisticated methods.
•
Search Engine: a program and associated hardware and processes that
allows people to find information on the Web, typically via the submission of queries consisting
of terms.
from other websites or via direct navigation.
Search Traffic: visitors to a site that come from search engines rather than
Search: a submission of a query to a search engine, usually in the form of
•
terms forming a query.
Share: sharing of an article or webpage typically via some social media
platform.
•
•
Social Media: content that is shared via a social networking website.
Unique Visits: visitor traffic to a website within a given period that includes
only the first visit (i.e., subsequent visits are ignored), which excludes repeat visits; provides a
count of the individuals who have visited a site in a given period.


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page409 of 883
Unique Daily Visitors: visitor traffic to a website who visits a site at least
once in a given 24-hour period. Each visitor, to the site, is counted once during the reporting period,
which means it excludes repeat visits; provides a count of the individuals who have visited a site
on a given day.
•
unique and repeat visits.
•
Visits: a count of all the traffic to a website in a given period, including both
Web Analytics: the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of web
data.
VI.
METHODOLOGY
16.
I was asked to determine the dissemination of articles containing the statements
made against Ms. Giuffre.
17.
In forming my opinion, I utilized accepted web analytics and related
methodologies in developing my assessment.
18.
To that end, I employed various publicly available online analytic services, as well
as some subscription-based services in conducting my research, including:
Alexa: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis.
Compete: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis.
•
Google Keyword Tool: an online service that provides the number of
searches for a given set of keywords in a given month on the Google search engine.
•
Google Trends: an online service that shows how often a particular term is
relatively searched on the Google search engine in a given period.
Similiar Web: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis.
•
SpyFu: an online service providing search data and analytics, including for
both paid (i.e., advertisements) and organic (i.e., natural or algorithmic) channels.
W3Snoop: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis.

19.
These tools offer a variety of data and analysis services, and they are frequently
utilized by industry professionals in the search engine optimization, web analytics, and search
engine marketing fields for market, customer, and competitive analysis. Furthermore, where
possible, I did my own assessments, as outlined below, in order to validate the data and analysis
results.
20.
I also utilized search engines, primarily Google and Bing, to assess the
dissemination of articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.
21.
Whenever possible, I used multiple data sources, which is a data verification
technique known as triangulation?, where one uses multiple and disparate sources for analysis
and then compare the results from the separate analysis. If the results are similar, it reinforces
the conclusion that the overall data analysis is valid.
22.
In all of my assessments, I have used the most conservative numbers, meaning
that I use the smallest value in arriving at the dissemination of articles containing the statements
made against Ms. Giuffre. If I had not employed this conservative estimate, the number of
potential dissemination of the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre would
be 102,740,816 (i.e., more than 102 million) daily unique visitors.
23.
In situations where I believed that I could not adequately verify the number of
individuals or did not have confidence in the numbers in those situations, I did not include those
numbers in the calculation of daily unique visitors.
24.
My analysis is based on my experience, training, knowledge, and education and is
formed through the application of that experience, training, knowledge, and education in the

principles of web data collection, web analytics, web search, search engines, web sites, and
related areas.
VII. DISSEMINATION OF THE STATEMENTS MADE AGAINST MS. GIUFFRE
25.
My opinion is that articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre
have been disseminated to at least 115 online media and others sites in 178 separate stories or
articles with a combine 66,909,965 unique daily visitors.
26.
This is a conservative estimate, and it is more likely than not, the statements have
received wider dissemination due to factors such as:
a.
I used a set of online websites (115) to calculate the dissemination of
articles, and it is reasonable that I have not located all references to the statements made against
Ms. Giuffre by the time of the submission of this report. So, there may be more sites with
articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre that are not included in my
calculations.
My focus of analysis was the online dissemination of the statements made
against Ms. Giuffre. Therefore, I examined only online sources and not dissemination of the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre via print or broadcast media. It is reasonable to assume that
the statements made against Ms. Giuffre were disseminated via these other channels.
C.
I have not attempted to measure face-to-face dissemination of the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre. Therefore, these sources of dissemination are not included
in the count of daily unique visitors.
d.
I did not have access to certain online sources where the statements
against Ms. Giuffre may have been disseminated (e.g., email messages, social media messages,
10


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page412 of 883
articles behind firewalls, etc.). Therefore, these sources are not included in the count of daily
unique visitors.
e.
There may be sites that have hosted articles containing the statements
made against Ms. Giuffre where the articles have been removed. Therefore, I did not include
these sites in my calculation of the unique daily visitors.
f.
There are sites where the visitor data is not accessible or where I could not
reasonably check the number of visitors. In these cases, even though I had confirmed the site
had posted one or more articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not
include these sites in my calculation of the unique daily visitors.
g.
I did not consider the dissemination via social media platforms of articles
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.
h.
Many sites published multiple articles on multiple days that contain or
reference the statements made against Ms. Giuffre; however, I did not use these multiple articles
from the same site with different publication dates in my calculations in determining the number
of daily unique visitors who have been exposed to the articles containing the statements made
against Ms. Giuffre.
i.
I did not include articles that link to one or more of the articles containing
the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. Unless the article directly referenced the statements
made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not include it in my analysis.
j.
Finally, I did not include people who may been searching and may have
seen the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the search results, without needing to visit the
actual articles posted on the websites.

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having
sexual relations with her, which he denies.
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as
they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old
defamatory claims.

I have been informed that the statements made against Ms. Giuffre were
confirmed by Ms. Maxwell in a news article and video" aired on 5 January 2015, which I have

30.
Additionally, on 8 January 2015, agents reportedly acting on behalf of Ms.
Maxwell made statements that the allegations against her were a "web of lies and deceit"13,
which are similar to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the message from Mr. Gow.
31.
Similarly, on 1 February 2015, like statements were quoted as "These allegations
are untrue and defamatory"14, which are similar to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in
the message from Mr. Gow.
32.
Based on my investigation and research, news stories, articles, and postings
containing direct reference to or quotes from the statements made against Ms. Giuffre appeared
the same day (i.e., 2 January 2015) as the email from Mr. Gow, with several news organizations
and other sites publishing other articles containing direct reference to or quotes from the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the immediately following days. News articles
containing direct reference to or quotes of the statements made against Ms. Giuffre have
continued to appear in news articles and other postings nearly up to the date that I submitted this
report.

35.
Concerning the procedure employed in determining the dissemination of the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, nearly every major news site' that I investigated, along
with other specific news sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia,
as well as other countries, have carried some aspects of the overall story related to Ms. Giuffre
and/or Ms. Maxwell, or other parties involved.
36.
In fact, there are tens of thousands of news articles and postings concerning the
general story from news outlets worldwide, with combined potential viewership in the multi-
millions, as searches on the major search engines, such as Google and Bing, show.
IS Including the largest online news sites, such as Yahoo! News, Google News, Huffington Post, CNN, NY Times, Fox News, NBC News, Daily
Mail, Washington Post, The Guardian, Wall Street Journal, ABC News, BBC News, USA Today, LA Times (see

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page417 of 883
37.
However, I was not interested in news articles that just discussed the story in
general or other aspects of the story. Also, I was not interested in those articles where Ms.
Maxwell or those acting on her behalf, such as Mr. Gow, would just generally deny the
allegations in the complaint. I was specifically interested in only those articles that referenced
directly or quoted the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the 2 January 2015 email message
from Mr. Gow, Ms. Maxwell's subsequent confirmation of the statements, or similar statements
as those in the message from Mr. Gow. Naturally, this narrow focus is a smaller subset of news
articles than are the articles addressing the overall story.
38.
To isolate these articles of interest, I generated a series of 10 queries! that
specifically targeted news articles from the case that addressed the statements made against Ms.
Maxwell (e.g., Ghislaine Maxwell obvious lies) to retrieve a set of articles that directly related to
the statements made against Ms. Giuffre!. I employed a modified snowball technique, starting
with one seed query, adding and modifying terms, until I was not retrieving new results. I also
located some articles via navigating from the set of retrieved articles.
39.
I set the search range date from 2 January 2015 onward, so articles prior to that
date were not included in the search results. For each article used in my analysis, I also verified
the date that the article was published to ensure it was published on or after 2 January 2015 and
that the articles directly referenced in some way the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.
40.

Ghislaine Maxwell, after walking out the side door of her E65St.

Giuffre's claims "obvious lies.".
42.
I then personally verified that each article, by reviewing each article, used in my
analysis directly referenced in some way the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.
43.
So, articles relating to the overall story that did not mention Ms. Maxwell's
statements made against Ms. Giuffre were not included in the analysis. Articles relating to the
overall story that referred to Ms. Maxwell simply denying the charges were not included.
44.
I also personally performed a site search?° of the top 15 online media sites
worldwide?' of articles related to the case, and I reviewed the results to identify if any of these

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page419 of 883
articles referred to the statements against Ms. Giuffre. I also did the same for many country-
specific news sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
45.
In the end, I had a set of 178 online news and other articles from 2 January 2105
to the date that I filed this report that specifically referenced the statements made against Ms.
Giuffre to conduct my analysis, as outlined below.
46.
Each of these 178 online articles was posted online. The 178 online articles were
distributed among 115 unique domain websites (i.e., some websites posted multiple articles that
contain the statements made against Ms. Giuffre). These 115 domains are:

47.
As seen from the list of domains that have published articles or stories containing
references to the statement made against Ms. Giuffre, many of these domains are those of major
news organizations or sources, including AOL News, BBC, Huffington Post, International
Business Times, Irish Times, MSN News, National Enquirer, New York Daily News, New
Zealand Herald, Page Six, Radar Online, Reuters, The Daily Beast, The Daily Mail, The
Express, The Guardian, The Mirror, The Sun, The Telegraph, Yahoo! News, etc.
48.
I then used a variety of web analytics traffic services and other sources to get the
unique daily visitor traffic for each of these domains. I used multiple services when available to
verify the unique daily visitor traffic for each of these domains, as these traffic services may use
different techniques to arrive at their traffic numbers.
49.
In cases of conflicting unique daily visitor traffic numbers, I utilized the most
conservative (i.e., smallest) number.
50.
In cases where I determined I could not get unique daily visitor traffic numbers or
the unique daily visitor traffic were not reliable, in my opinion, I did not include the unique daily
visitor traffic numbers for that domain in the numbers. This usually occurred for the sites with a
smaller number of daily visitors or sites with an extremely large number of daily visitors.
51.
Unique daily visitors measure is an industry standard web analytics metric for
measuring people that visit a website in a given day, also known as unique audience?. It is
generally averaged out over multiple days with a given period, such as week or month, as there
are normal daily fluctuations.
52.
Table 1 shows the unique daily visitor traffic for the listed domains that posted
articles or stories referencing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre and the associated unique

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page423 of 883
daily visitor traffic for each of those domains, along with number of articles containing the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre posted on that site.
53.
Table 1: Domains that published articles or stories containing the statements
made against Ms. Giuffre with the domain's number of unique daily visitors and the
number of articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre published on that
domain from 2 January 2015 to the date that I filed this report23.

a - Unique daily visitor traffic not available
b - Unique daily visitor traffic not verifiable
54.
I used each domain's unique daily visitor count to calculate the dissemination of
the articles containing the statements against Ms. Giuffre to various websites and potentially to
visitors to that site (1.e., as visitors to the news sites, these individuals could have been exposed
to the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffie), using the unique daily visitor
number only once for each domain, regardless whether that domain published more than one
article referring to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.
IX. RESULTS FOR ANALYSIS OF THE DISSEMINATION OF THE STATEMENTS
MADE AGAINST MS. GIUFFRE
55.
Based on my analysis as outlined above, my opinion is that the statements against
Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to at least 115 online media and other sites with 178 stories
or articles with a combined 66,909,965 (more than 66 million) unique daily visitors traffic.
56.
I note that for many of the 178 articles containing the statements made against
Ms. Giuffre, one could get gist of the story of the article directly from the article headline. I
point this out as it is well known that people skim online news sites?4
, so titles such as these
24 See for example: Aikat, D. News on the web: usage trends of an on-line newspaper. Convergence: The International Journal of Research into
New Media Technologies 4, 4 (Dec. 1998), 94-110.
25


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page427 of 883
would have substantial impact on visitors to that site. Examples of such articles headlines
(examples of actual headlines from the 178 articles) are:
•
British socialite to face Epstein accuser's defamation lawsuit
•
Alleged Epstein madam denies calling teen 'sex slave' a liar
•
Sex-Trafficking Denials Aren't Libel, Brit Says
•
U.S. woman who claimed she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew
sues British socialite for denying that she recruited her to be a sex slave
•
British 'madam' accused of recruiting teenage 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts
for Prince Andrew's friend Jeffrey Epstein denies calling her a liar
•
Ghislaine Maxwell denies calling Virginia Roberts a liar
Bill Clinton Pedophile Sex Scandal: Socialite Denies Calling ENQUIRER
Source A Liar, Woman files defamation suit against British publishing magnate
•
Jeffrey Epstein sex slave accuser sues Brit socialite for defamation
Lawyers for British socialite accused of pimping 'sex slave' to Jeffrey
Epstein push to dismiss defamation lawsuit.
57.
This is a conservative estimate, and more likely than not, articles containing the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to more individuals.
x.
WHY THE ESTIMATE IS LOW
58.
This (66,909,965 individual unique daily traffic) is a conservative estimate, and it
is more likely than not, the statements have received wider dissemination due to factors such as:
a.
Although I spend considerable effort to locate published articles that
contained the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, it is reasonable to assume that I have not
located all such articles by the time of the submission of this report. So, there are possibly more
26


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page428 of 883
sites with articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre that are not included in my
calculations, which would increase the dissemination of the articles.
b.
The focus of my analysis was the dissemination of online articles
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, and I examined only online sources and not
print or broadcast media. Many of the media outlets that I did identify have consider print
distribution?
, which are not included in my calculations, for example, such as:
• The Sun (print circulation) 1,741,838
• Daily Mail (print circulation) 1,562,361
• The Daily Telegraph (print circulation) 472,936
• The Times (print circulation) 402,752
• The Guardian (print circulation) 161,152
C.
In my analysis, I did not attempt to measure face-to-face dissemination
that may have occurred after individuals may have read articles containing the statements made
against Ms. Giuffre, which would increase the count.
d.
Naturally, I could not access certain online sources where the statements
made against Ms. Giuffre may have been disseminated (e.g., email messages, social media
messages, articles behind firewalls, etc.). Therefore, these numbers are not included in my
calculations.
e.
Also, there are possibly sites that have hosted articles containing the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre where the articles have been removed. Therefore, they are
not included in my calculations.

27


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page429 of 883
f.
For sites where one or more of the articles containing the statements made
against Ms. Giuffre are posted but where I could not locate or not determine reliable daily unique
visitor traffic, I have not included these sites in my calculations. There are 59 (of the 115 sites,
51.3%) where I could not get or not get verifiable traffic data. For example, the traffic numbers
for the MSN News (Microsoft) and Yahoo! News are not separated by news and other services,
such as search, so I did not include these in the number of people to which the articles containing
the statements made against were disseminated
g.
I did not include the dissemination of the articles containing the statements
made against Ms. Giuffre directly to social media platforms. However, many of the articles
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre do include counts of the number of times
that individuals shared the article to a social media networks, as shown in Table 2.

containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.

ii.
As shown in Table 2, the articles containing the statements made against
Ms. Giuffre have been shared 33,758 times, mostly on Facebook.
iii.
Given that the median number of Facebook 'friends' is 20026, this equates
to a possible 6,751,600 individuals, in addition to the 33,758 individuals who originally shared

29


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page431 of 883
the articles, to which the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre could have
been disseminated, assuming these individuals are all unique and have not already read one of
the articles.
iv.
V.
However, I did not include these social media shares in my calculations.
Since news article viewing follows a power law? distribution?8, there is no
direct linear ratio of number of social media shares to readership. There is published research
that does report average of views of an article on a news website and also average social media
shares'. In a direct calculation with numbers from this article, 23 articles views per social
media share, using 33,758 social media shares, this would be 776,434 article views. However,
this ratio would vary by website, number of daily unique visitors, type of news article, time for
accumulating shares, and possibly other factors. Plus, this number would not account for the
people receiving the social media share that viewed the title, post, and snippet but did not click
on the share to view the article on the website, thereby undercounting views of the articles.
vi.
Also, given the topical nature of the underlying news story, one could
expect lower social media sharing but higher article viewing, as people will tend to read articles
on such topics privately but not share on social media
'. So, I would expect the social media
number itself to be an undercount.
h.
I did not include articles that link to one of the articles containing the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre in my calculations of dissemination. Unless the article

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page432 of 883
directly mentioned the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not include that article in my
calculations. So, unless the linking article actually mentioned, referenced, or quoted the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not include it in the calculations.
i.
Many sites published multiple articles on multiple days that quoted or
referenced the statements made against Ms. Giuffre; however, I did not use these multiple
publication dates from the same site in my calculations of unique visitor traffic. If a domain
published only one article containing the statements against Ms. Giuffre, then I directly used the
unique daily visitors number. If a domain published multiple articles concerning the statements
against Ms. Giuffre, I did not count the traffic for the subsequent articles containing the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, even though research shows that repeat traffic to websites
is generally only about 30%32, meaning that 70% of the traffic would be unique. However, I was
not comfortable using this figure given the natural of these sites, which might have higher repeat
visitors day-to-day. Therefore, I did not include the unique visitors to multiple articles in my
calculations.
j.
Finally, I did not include the count of people who may been searching and
may have seen the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the search results, without needing to
visit the actual articles, as shown in Figure 4.

Ms. Giuffre appearing in the result snippets, requiring no need to visit the articles
themselves.

XI. ACCURACY
OF THE TRAFFIC NUMBERS AND ADDITIONAL
VERIFICATION

59.
Concerning the accuracy of the analysis, the number of domains where the
statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated is reliable, as this is straightforward
to verify (i.e., the article is either posted on a site or it is not). If anything, this is an undercount,
as some domains, for example, may have removed such articles, making them no longer
available. There are possibly articles containing the statements that I have not been able to
locate by the time that I submitted this report.
60.
Concerning traffic numbers for domains, a unique visitor is typically identified by
an identifier stored in a text file, which is based on an individual computer's browser, although
more sophisticated methods are also being used. In locating traffic numbers for the domains, I
used multiple services when available and attempted to verify via other sources. In case with
varying traffic data, I utilized the most conservative (i.e., smallest) number available.
61.
I also verified findings from my analysis via other methods and my own
experience and training. For example, there are periods of increased publishing of articles
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre and related stories. One would expect,
increases in associated searching during these periods. Using the Google Keyword Tool, which
provides search volume for search queries by month, I examined search volume from January
2015 to the date that I filed this report. There was an 54,518% increase in search volume for the
keywords Virginia Giuffre Virginia Roberts Ghislaine Maxwell in January 2015, relative to the
prior 7 months, in the US, and a 44,822% increase for the United Kingdom (UK) in January
2015, relative to the prior 7 months. This is in line with the increase in posting of articles during
the same month33. So, one sees the expected increase in searching for key terms based on the
increase posting of articles.
33 Note: I use the US and the UK as sample countries since there are aspect of the story that relate to each country.

SUMMARY
64.
The statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to at least
115 online media or other sites in 178 separate stories or articles with a combined
66,909,965 individual unique visitors from 2 January 2015 to the date that I filed this
report, inclusive. More likely than not, this is a conservative estimate.

32.
However, nowhere in his report does Mr. Anderson explain why these 26 search
terms are important, beyond the fact that, he claims incorrectly, searching the major search
engines with these phrases results in links to Web pages that contain allegedly defamatory
material. However, this is true of literally thousands of different search phrases
it's a simple
task to create search terms to match particular pages
but he never explains why these
particular 26 phrases are relevant.
33.
As I explain below in detail, Mr. Anderson's testimony is unreliable because it is
not based on sufficient facts or data, nor is it the product of reliable principles and methods.
Rather, it is seriously flawed in a number of ways.
Mr. Anderson's Choice of Search Terms Is Arbitrary
34.
Mr. Anderson, in his report, provides a list of 26 search terms (Page 7) that appear
to have been chosen in an arbitrary manner; furthermore, Mr. Anderson does not explain how
these search terms are relevant to this case. Most of the examples are rarely if ever searched
upon, and return few, if any, relevant results (that is, links to pages that discuss or recount
Defendant's alleged defamatory statements).
35.
Search terms are only relevant to this case if a searcher, wishing to find
information about Plaintiff, would type the terms into a search engine. Mr. Anderson does not
explain why such a person would type, for instance, the term victims refuse silence sex slave; in
fact there seems no reason to believe that such a person would use this term. Why would
someone wanting to research information about Plaintiff use the term virginia roberts lies, or
virginia roberts ross gow? Mr. Anderson does not suggest any reason that somebody should use
such terms. Indeed, these are terms unlikely to be used by anyone unfamiliar with this litigation
or the fact that Defendant had denied Plaintiff's original allegations. These are not terms likely
to be used by Mr. Anderson's "casual searcher" ('I conducted an investigation to determine the

106. However, this 3-step process (create pages, place them on Web sites, create links
to the pages) is not very efficient, regardless of the fact that it is common in the ORM business.
One should keep in mind that the primary goal of any business is maximizing profits, not
efficiency. The 3-step process may be inefficient, but it has the advantage of increasing the
income of ORM firms; rather than merely creating links, they can also charge for the creation
and placement of Web pages. There is, however, an alternative strategy that some ORM firms in
fact do use, as I describe later in this report.
The Problems With Mr. Anderson's Strategy
107. Mr. Anderson's strategy is unnecessarily expensive and complicated, for a
number of reasons:
• Mr. Anderson exaggerates the number of Web pages (780) that must be pushed down
in the search results
• Placing new Web pages on quality Web sites will be very difficult, and unnecessary
• Pushing the new Web pages up in the search results will be very difficult
a)
Mr. Anderson Exaggerates the Number of Web Pages (780)
That Must Be Pushed Down In The Search Results
108. Mr. Anderson has stated that 780 Web pages must be pushed down in the search
results; he takes his 26 search phrases, and multiplies by 30 results (in theory 10 results per
search-result page, over three pages, in order to push the "offending" pages down to the fourth
page, though in some cases, in particular on Google, there may actually be fewer results on the
first page, perhaps 8 or 9.) This is wrong for various reasons.
Most of the Search Terms Will be Used Infrequently If Ever
109. As noted earlier, most of Mr. Anderson's 26 search terms are infrequently if ever
employed by searchers. Why, for instance, would it be necessary to push down offending Web
pages in the results that the search engines provide for the term victims refuse silence sex slave,
when this term is likely never used (and furthermore, that the search results contain no

ACUITY Reputation
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having
sexual relations with her, which he denies.
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as
they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old
defamatory claims.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein/Virginia Roberts: NOTIFICATION OF
IDENTIFIED VICTIM
Dear Ms. Roberts:
By virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District
of Florida provides you with the following notice because you are an identified victim of a
federal offense.
On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as "Epstein) entered a plea
of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution)
and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in
and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB and 2008-cf-
009381AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment to be
followed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve months of
Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the Court.
In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to
defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain
conditions, including the following:
An independent Special Master was assigned the task of selecting an
attorney representative to represent the victims, including you, in
connection with civil actions between the victims and Mr. Epstein. The

ni
Special Master selected Robert Josefsberg, Esq. of the firm Podhurst
Orseck, P.A., a highly-respected and experienced attorney. You are not
obligated to use Mr. Josefsberg as your civil attorney, but, as explained
in greater detail below, Mr. Josefsberg's services will be provided at no
cost to you because Mr. Epstein is obligated to pay the costs and fees
of the attorney-representative. Also, Mr. Epstein and his attorneys can
only contact you via Mr. Josefsberg, assuming that you would like Mr.
Josefsberg to serve as your attorncy.
If you elect to file suit against Mr. Epstein pursuant to Title 18, United
States Code, Section 2255, Mr. Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida
over his person and/or the subject matter, and Mr. Epstein waives his
right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages up
to an amount as agreed to between you and Mr. Epstein, so long as you
elect to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and you waive any.
other claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common
law. Notwithstanding this waiver, Epstein's agreement with the United
States, his waivers and failure to contest liability and such damages in
any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any criminal or civil
liability.
As stated above, Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney
representative selected by the independent third party. This provision,
however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of
contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of
potential settlements, you and Mr. Josefsberg elect to file a contested
lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 or you elect to pursue any other
contested remedy, the obligation to pay the costs of the attorney
representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay
reasonable attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in Section
2255, shall cease.
Please contact either myself at ann.marie.c.villafana@usdoj.gov. or Justice
Department Victim-Witness Specialist Twiler Smith at Twiler.Smith@ic.fbi.gov with a good
telephone number and/or e-mail address, so that we may provide Mr. Josefsberg with a
timely means of communicating with you. If you would like to contact Mr. Josefsberg

directly, he can be reached at +1 305 358-2800.
If you have already selected other counsel to represent you, or if you do so in the
future, and you decide to file a claim against Jeffrey Epstein, Mr. Epstein's attorney, Jack
Goldberger, asks that you have your attorney contact Mr. Goldbergerat Atterbury Goldberger
and Weiss, 250 Australian Avenue South, Suite 1400, West Palm Beach, FL 33401, (561)
659-8300.
In addition, there has been litigation between the United States and two other victims
regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement between the United States and Mr. Epstein.
Mr. Josefsberg can provide further guidance on this issue, or if you select another attorney
to represent you, that attorney can review the Court's order in the matter of In re Jane Does
1 and 2, United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Court File No. 08-
80736-CIV-MARRA.
Please understand that neither the U.S. Attorney's Office nor the Federal Bureau of
Investigation can take part in or otherwise assist in civil litigation. Thank you for all of your
assistance during the course of the federal and state investigations and please accept the
heartfelt regards of myself and Special Agents Kuyrkendall, Slater, and Richards for your
health and well-being.

Hi there,
Thank you again for your email.
We totally understand your concerns. Please don't worry about anything.
Whatever happens, we are bound by confidentiality unless you consent to an
article in a formal contract signed by you.
Since I will be in the air by the time you wake up, can you email our
Assistant Editor Sian James -- sian.james@mailonsunday.co.uk -- your
lawyer's information please?
Sian will arrange to get him whatever assurances he requires. We really
want to make this work and of course we want to protect you.
We'll be really grateful if your lawyer will provide us his cell phone
number as we'd like to sort this all out asap. Meaning we would like to
talk to him Saturday EST.
I will give you a call from Sydney. Fingers crossed we get over this last
hurdle!
Best regards,
Sharon

Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed
by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media
related material from the residence.
Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as
the Kitchen Staff Office.
I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the
left side cover removed,
exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor
next to a glass type desk.
The CPU had no discernable identifiers or
features indicating a make or model.
This CPU was powered off with
the power cord not plugged in.
The keyboard and mouse were atop the
It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,
printer, or other media device.
On the back Panel of the CPU, I
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk:
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search
and no external camera was located within this room.
The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel
LCD screen:
The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,
CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc.
This type of media is
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media
was found.
After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU. and turned
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis
via a property receipt.
I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west.
The desk held a
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse,
media card reader and
printer; however, no CPU was located.
All of the cables were removed
from an area where a computer had once been.
A search of the desk
area revealed no signs of any media devices.
Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of
the pool.
In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office
type setting, with an I-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located.
All of the

certain questions.
Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein
would ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her, to
rub his nipples as he masturbated himself.
Sjoberg stated she felt
"grossed" about the behavior but as she was getting paid, she just

Epstein would on occasion, utilize the

maintained himself covered under the towel he would be wearing. When
Epstein would masturbate he would be covered.

The victim then returned the call at 11:16 am which lasted 6 seconds.
The victim then made contact with
| at 11:22 am for 877.2 seconds

These sequences of calls were consistent
with what the victim had described to me on the date of the
intimidation.
Inmediately after speaking with the victim,

forty-eight seconds.
A call is then immediately received, a telephone
number registered to a Corporation affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein
located at 457 Madison Ave in New York. An extensive computer check
revealed 457 Madison Ave is a business address in which Epstein has
his corporations assigned to.
Epstein had corporation attorney,
Darren Indyke, register the businesses and register himself as an
agent.
I also observed Epstein has his El Zorro Ranch Corporation,
New York Strategy Group, Ghislaine Corporation, J Epstein and Company
and the Financial Strategy Group registered to this same address.
Finally, a third call is received by
at 12:02 pm from the same
corporate number which lasts 12 minutes and 1 second.
It should be
noted that there is no further contact with either the victim during
the month of March or April of 2006.
I also noted that there was no
further contact with Sarah Kellen or Jeffrey Epstein during the
remainder of the month of March or April 2006.
On June 1, 2006, ASA Lana Belohlavek telephoned me to inform me of the
meeting that occurred with Atty. Jack Goldberger and her reference
this case.
She advised she would make her determination on whether to•
file on this case or not by Monday June 5, 2006.

ITEMIZED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
EARNINGS RECORD INFORMATION
Date: 10/25/2016
Our records show the amount of earnings reported, not the amount of
Social Security taxes that were paid.
Wages were first covered under Social Security in 1937. Therefore,
1937 is the first year for which earnings may be shown on our records.
Employers were required to report earnings semi-annually in 1937,
and on a quarterly basis for the years from 1938 through 1977.
Beginning with 1978, employers are required to report earnings annually.
records do not show the exact date of employment (month and day)
because we do not need this information to figure Social Security
benefits. Employers do not give us this information.
Each year, there is a maximum amount of earnings that is subject to
Social Security taxes and is used to compute benefits.
If a person
earns more than this maximum amount, the earnings statement will
usually show the maximum rather than the total earnings. Maximum
benefits can be found on the SSA website.
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html
Beginning in 1951, self-employed persons could also receive
Social Security credit for their work.
The maximum amounts of
self-employment earnings that are subject to Social Security taxes
and are used to compute benefits can also be found on the SSA website.
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html
If you have any questions, you should call, write,
or visit any
Social Security office.
If you visit or call, please bring this letter.
It will help us answer questions.
The toll free number to call is
1-800-772-1213 (for the deaf or hard of hearing, call our TTY number,
1-800-325-0778) •

Subject: FW: URGENT - this is the statement
Jane Doe 3 Is Virginia Roberts so not a new individual.
The allegations made by Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.
The original allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to
be untrue
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschwitz is
involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised
as news, as they are defamatory.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA
_Case No. 08-80736-Civ-Marra/Johnson
JANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2
V.
UNITED STATES
JANE DOE #3 AND JANE DOE #4's CORRECTED MOTION PURSUANT TO RULE 21
FOR JOINDER IN ACTION
COME NOW Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 (also referred to as "the new victims"), by and
through undersigned counsel, to file this motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21
to join this action, on the condition that they not re-litigate any issues already litigated by Jane
Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 (also referred to as "the current victims"). The new victims have
suffered the same violations of their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) as the
current victims. Accordingly, they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.
Because the new victims will not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by the current victims
(and because they are represented by the same legal counsel as the current victims), the
Government will not be prejudiced if the Court grants the motion. The Court may "at any time"
add new parties to the action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Accordingly, the Court should grant the
motion.'
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
'As minor victims of sexual offenses, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 desire to proceed by
way of pseudonym for the same reasons that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 proceeded in this
fashion. Counsel for the new victims have made their true identities known to the Government.


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page869 of 883
Case 9:08-CV-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 2 of 14
As the Court is aware, more than six years ago, Jane Doe #1 filed the present action
against the Government, alleging a violation of her rights under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771.
DEI. She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had
entered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her
rights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court allowed Jane Doe #2 to also join the
action. Both Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to
protect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with
fairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #1
and Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.
The Court has firmly rejected the United States' position. In a detailed ruling, the Court
concluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 even though federal
charges were never filed. DE 189. The Court explained that because the NPA barred
prosecution of crimes committed against them by Epstein, they had "standing" to assert
violations of the CVRA rights. Id. The Court deferred ruling on whether the two victims would
be entitled to relief, pending development of a fuller evidentiary record. Id.
Two other victims, who are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims,
now wish to join this action. The new victims joining at this stage will not cause any delay and
their joinder in this case is the most expeditious manner in which to pursue their rights. Because
the background regarding their abuse is relevant to the Court's assessment of whether to allow
them to join, their circumstances are recounted here briefly.
Jane Doe #3's Circumstances

Epstein.

The Government was well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it
listed her as a victim in the attachment to the NPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary investigation
of Jane Doe #3's relationship to Epstein would have revealed the fact that she had been
trafficked throughout the United States and internationally for sexual purposes. Nonetheless, the
Government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any
Federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As
with Jane Doe #1, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement
from Jane Doe #3 - all in violation of her rights under the CVRA - to avoid Jane Doe #3 from
raising powerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein

and other powerful individuals and that would likely have been prevented it from being
concluded in the secretive manner in which it was.
Jane Doe #4's Circumstances
If permitted to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could prove at trial, that
she has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, based on the
following:
As with the other Jane Does, Jane Doe #4 was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein, In
or around the summer of 2002, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulncrable sixteen-year-
old child, was told by another one of Epstein's underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could
make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe
#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4
to go to Epstein's house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the
phone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to
his mansion in Palm Beach.
Jane Doe #4 then went to Epstein's mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein's large
bathroom by one of Epstein's assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and lay face
down on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her
age and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed illegal
sexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.
Epstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these
sexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.e., on his personal
jet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doe #4.


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page875 of 883
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 8 of 14
The acts Epstein committed against Jane Doe #4, constituted numerous federal sex
offenses, some of which do not carry a statute of limitations and thus are not time-barred. See 18
U.S.C. § 3283. And these offenses were the kinds of offenses that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida were pursuing
in 2007. So far as Jane Doe #4 is aware, the U.S. Attorney's Office made no serious effort to
locate her. Instead, after identifying approximately forty separate underage sexually abused
victims, and apparently preparing a 53-page federal indictment and with full awareness of the
existence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 - unidentified and not interviewed - it entered into a
non-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein's federal crimes against these victims.
This is contrary to the Government's normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It
also violated Jane Doe #4's rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a
"reasonable" right to confer with the U.S. Attorney's Office before they entered into an
agreement with a sex offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he committed against
her. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(S)•
MOTION FOR JOINDER
Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 now both move to join this action filed by Jane Doe #1 and
Jane Doe #2, pursuant to Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 21 provides that
"[o]n motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add ... a party." Rule 21
"grants the court broad discretion to permit a change in the parties at any stage of a litigation."
Fordy. Air Line Pilots Ass'n Int'l, 268 F. Supp. 2d 271, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (internal quotation
omitted). The new victims should be allowed to join the current victims in this action under Rule
21.

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page876 of 883
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 9 of 14
The new victims will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in
the same way as it violated the rights of the other victims. The new victims participation in this
case is important because it appears that the Government intends to raise a factual defense that
somehow it did keep Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 properly informed of what was happening in
the criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not
properly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for
a CVRA violation.
In addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation is relevant to a defense the
Court has allowed the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims'
request for rescission of the NPA "implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be
considered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant
prosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims - including an assessment of the
allegation of a deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims
in the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well
after the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli." DE
189 at 12 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3's and Jane Doe #4's participation in this case will
help to show what the "entire interface" was between the Government and the victims and thus
to respond to the Government's estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be
preparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the Government to the victim's
summary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments against the
victim's position).


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page877 of 883
Case 9:08-cV-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 10 of 14
Jane Doe #3's and Jane Doe #4's participation is also directly relevant to the discovery
disputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections
to the documents that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 are attempting to obtain. The current
victims have responded by explaining how these documents are relevant, including explaining
how these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his powerful political and
social connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government's
motive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims' claims in an effort to
maintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims' knowledge. See, e.g.,
DE 266 at 6-10. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation will help prove the relevancy of
these requests, as well as the need for those requests.
One clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding
Epstein's lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea
arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince
Andrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2
have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the
non-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and
political connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See,
e.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at 16-18). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knowledge of
Epstein's connection with some of these powerful people and thus how Epstein might have used
them to secure favorable treatment.
Adding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings. They will
simply join in motions that the current victims were going to file in any event. For example, the
10


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page878 of 883
Case 9:08-CV-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 11 of 14
new victims will simply join in a single summary judgment motion that the current victims
anticipate filing after discovery has been completed.
Nor will adding the new victims prejudice the United States. As the court is aware, this
Court is still in its initial discovery stage. The Court is currently considering whether to reject
the Government's assertion of privilege over documents regarding the case. See DE 265
(victims' reassertion of objections to the Government privilege claims). The new victims do not
seek any additional
discovery beyond that previously sought by the current victims.'
Accordingly, the United States will not be prejudiced or burdened by adding them to this case.
The CVRA does not contain any statute of limitations for filing an action to enforce
rights under the statute. Accordingly, were the Court to deny this motion, the result might be
that the new victims would then be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims, which would
then possibly proceed on a separate litigation track. Rather than require duplicative litigation,
the Court should simply grant their motion to join.
Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 support the joinder motion. Counsel for the victims have
discussed this motion with the Government at length in an effort to avoid any need to file a
substantive pleading on the issue. Counsel for the victims asked the Government during the
summer for its position on joinder.
The Government, however, took the matter under
advisement for months.
Ultimately, after several inquiries from victims counsel, the
Government indicated without explanation that it opposes this motion. Counsel for the victims
has requested a meeting with the Government on this issue, which will hopefully occur in
2 Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have asked the Government to provide them with the
record of their statements that they provided to the FBI. These FBI 302's should be only a few
pages long.

January. In the meantime, however, counsel for the victims believe that it is no longer
appropriate to delay filing this motion and accordingly file it at this time. Because the
Government is apparently opposing this motion, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have described
the circumstances surrounding their claims so that the Court has appropriate information to rule
on the motion.

CONCLUSION
Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 should be allowed to join this action, pursuant to Rule 21
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Their joinder should be conditioned on the requirement
that they not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. A
proposed order to that effect is attached to this pleading.

Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page2 of 38
Pursuant to Rule 56.1 of the Local Civil Rules of this Court, defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell submits this Reply to Plaintiff's Statement of Contested Facts and Plaintiff's
Undisputed Facts ("Response"), Doc. 586-1.
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff's Response fails under both the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Local Civil
Rules of Procedure.
First, Plaintiff largely failed to provide any "citation to evidence which would be
admissible" to challenge Defendant's Statement of Material Undisputed Facts and therefore
Ms. Maxwell's undisputed facts should be deemed admitted.
Second, rather than set forth "additional material facts as to which it is contended that
there exists a genuine issue to be tried" (Local Civil Rule 56.1(b)), Plaintiff instead set forth her
own purportedly "undisputed facts." Because Plaintiff did not cross-move for summary
judgment, her supposedly "undisputed facts" are not permitted by the Rules and should be
stricken.
I. Ms. Maxwell's reply in support of statement of undisputed facts.
1. Undisputed Fact 1: In early 2011 plaintiff in two British tabloid interviews made
numerous false and defamatory allegations against Ms. Maxwell. In the articles, plaintiff made
no direct allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in any improper conduct with Jeffrey
Epstein, who had pleaded guilty in 2007 to procuring a minor for prostitution. Nonetheless,
plaintiff suggested that Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein and may have known about the crime
for which he was convicted. Exs. A and B.
a. Reply: Plaintiff cites no admissible evidence to contest these undisputed facts.
McCawley Ex.34 (GIUFFRE368) is an email from Sharon Churcher to Plaintiff. It is Ms.
Churcher's hearsay and therefore inadmissible. In any event, it does not speak to the
1


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page3 of 38
contents of Plaintiff's interviews with Churcher. McCawley Decl. Ex. 31 is an FBI
interview, also inadmissible hearsay, which again does not describe Plaintiff's interviews
in news articles. In the absence of contrary evidence, Undisputed Fact 1 should be
deemed admitted.
2. Undisputed Fact 2: In the articles, plaintiff alleged she had sex with Prince
Andrew, "a well-known businessman," a "world-renowned scientist," a "respected liberal
politician," and a "foreign head of state." Exs. A-B at 5.
a. Reply: Plaintiff does not contest these facts and they therefore should be
deemed admitted.
3. Undisputed Fact 3: In response to the allegations Ms. Maxwell's British attorney,
working with Mr. Gow, issued a statement on March 9, 2011, denying "the various allegations
about [Ms. Maxwell] that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely
false." Ex.C.
a. Reply: Plaintiff "denies" that Mr. Barden "issued a statement," but offers no
admissible evidence to refute this point. Further, she acknowledges that the Statement
was issued "By Devonshires Solicitors," Mr. Barden's law firm.
4. Undisputed Fact 4: The statement read in full:
Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell
By Devonshires Solicitors, PRNE
Wednesday, March 9, 2011
London, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about
her that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely
false.
It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal representatives to
certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be
withdrawn have simply been ignored.
In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against
those newspapers.
2


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page4 of 38
"I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain
newspapers live by the adage, "why let the truth get in the way of a good story."
However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and
I ask that they stop," said Ghislaine Maxwell.
"A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their
reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation
or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name," she said.

Ex.C.
a.
Reply: Plaintiff does dispute the contents of the 2011 statement and therefore it
should be deemed admitted.
5. Undisputed Fact 5: Plaintiff's gratuitous and "lurid" accusations in an unrelated
action. In 2008 two alleged victims of Epstein brought an action under the Crime Victims'
Rights Act against the United States government purporting to challenge Epstein's plea
agreement. They alleged the government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the
agreement. Ex.D, at 2.
a.
Reply: Plaintiff "stipulates" to the facts contained in paragraph 5 and therefore
they should be deemed admitted.
6. Undisputed Fact 6: Seven years later, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre moved
to join the CVRA action, claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the government.
On January 1, 2015, Ms. Giuffre filed a "corrected" joinder motion. Ex.D at 1, 9.
Reply: Plaintiff "agreed" to this paragraph.


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page5 of 38
7. Undisputed Fact 7: The issue presented in her joinder motion was narrow: whether
she should be permitted to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 21, specifically, whether she was a "known victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the
Government owed them CVRA duties." Yet, "the bulk of the [motion] consists of copious
factual details that [plaintiff] and [her co-movant] would prove ... if allowed to join."" Ms.
Giuffre gratuitously included provocative and "lurid details" of her alleged sexual activities as an
alleged victim of sexual trafficking. Ex.E, at 5.
a.
Reply: Plaintiff does not dispute that Judge Marra made the findings detailed in
Undisputed Fact 7. Further, she admits that the Government refused to stipulate that she
"had been sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators (including co-
conspirator Alan Dershowitz), which would make her a 'victim' of a broad sex
trafficking conspiracy." Although she now submits there were other reasons for
inclusion of such lurid details, those reasons were rejected by Judge Marra. As she does
not offer any admissible evidence to contradict the findings made by Judge Marra, this
"fact," specifically Judge Marra's findings, should be deemed admitted. In any event, we
request under Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2) that the Court take judicial notice of the contents of
Judge Marra's ruling and order.
8. Undisputed Fact 8: At the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers
knew that the media had been following the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While
they deliberately filed the motion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre's name, claiming the need for
privacy and secrecy, they made no attempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they
filed the motion publicly. Ex.D, at 1 & n.l.
4


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page6 of 38
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence to refute these facts and they
therefore should be deemed admitted. Specifically, she does not offer any evidence to
dispute that she knew the media had been following Epstein and the CVRA action, nor
does she dispute that her attorneys made no attempt to file the motion under seal, rather
filing it publicly. The facts are thus admitted.
9. Undisputed Fact 9: As the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion,
Ms. Giuffre "name[d] several individuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts
performed and where they took place." The court ruled that "these lurid details are
unnecessary": "The factual details regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual
activities are immaterial and impertinent..., especially considering that these details involve
non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government." Accordingly, "It]hese
unnecessary details shall be stricken." Id. The court then struck all Ms. Giuffre's factual
allegations relating to her alleged sexual activities and her allegations of misconduct by non-
parties. The court said the striking of the "lurid details" was a sanction for Ms. Giuffre's
improper inclusion of them in the motion. Ex.E at 5-7.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence to refute these facts and they
therefore should be deemed admitted. See Reply to Undisputed Fact 7, supra. In any
event, we request under Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2) that the Court take judicial notice of the
contents of Judge Marra's ruling and order.
10. Undisputed Fact 10: The district court found not only that the "lurid details" were
unnecessary but also that the entire joinder motion was "entirely unnecessary." Ms. Giuffre and
her lawyers knew the motion with all its "lurid details" was unnecessary because the motion
5


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page7 of 38
itself recognized that she would be able to participate as a fact witness to achieve the same result
she sought as a party. The court denied plaintiff's joinder motion. Id. at 7-10.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence to refute these facts and they
therefore should be deemed admitted. See Reply to Undisputed Fact 7, supra.
11. Undisputed Fact 11: One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre "named" repeatedly in the
joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. According to the "lurid details" of Ms. Giuffre included in the
motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a "sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme"
created by Epstein:
• Ms. Maxwell "approached" plaintiff in 1999 when plaintiff was "fifteen years
old" to recruit her into the scheme.
• Ms. Maxwell was "one of the main women" Epstein used to "procure under-
aged girls for sexual activities."
• Ms. Maxwell was a "primary co-conspirator" with Epstein in his scheme.
•
She "persuaded" plaintiff to go to Epstein's mansion "in a fashion very similar
to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of
other children."
•
At the mansion, when plaintiff began giving Epstein a massage, he and
Ms. Maxwell "turned it into a sexual encounter."
• Ms. Maxwell also was a "co-conspirator in Epstein's sexual abuse."
• Ms. Maxwell "appreciated the immunity" she acquired under Epstein's plea
agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution "for the crimes
she committed in Florida."
• Ms. Maxwell "participat[ed] in the sexual abuse of [plaintiff] and others."
Ms. Maxwell "took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls
involved in sexual activities, including [plaintiff]." Id. She shared the photos
with Epstein.
6


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page8 of 38
As part of her "role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring," Ms. Maxwell "connected]"
Epstein with "powerful individuals" so that Epstein could traffick plaintiff to
these persons.
• Plaintiff was "forced to have sexual relations" with Prince Andrew in
"[Ms. Maxwell's] apartment" in London. Ms. Maxwell "facilitated" plaintiff's
sex with Prince Andrew "by acting as a 'madame' for Epstein."
• Ms. Maxwell "assist[ed] in internationally trafficking" plaintiff and "numerous
other young girls for sexual purposes."
•
Plaintiff was "forced" to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others "engage in
illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls."
Id. at 3-6.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence to refute the facts actually stated
in the paragraph, i.e., that the "lurid" details (as coined by Judge Marra) were included in
her CVRA Joinder Motion. Plaintiff claims to offer "admissible evidence" to
"corroborate the statements [she] made in the joinder motion." Setting aside for the
moment that most of the cited documents are inadmissible hearsay, as addressed later,
such evidence should be disregarded because none of the offered documents speak to fact
that these "lurid" details were actually included in the joinder motion, as a simple reading
of Ex. D reveals. Because Plaintiff does not refute that point, the fact that the details were
in the Joinder Motion should be deemed admitted. In any event, we request under Fed. R.
Evid. 201(c)(2) that the Court take judicial notice of the contents of plaintiff's CVRA
joinder motion.
12.
Undisputed Fact 12: In the joinder motion, plaintiff also alleged she was "forced"
to have sex with Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, "model scout" Jean Luc Brunel, and
"many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful
business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders."
Id. at 4-6.
7


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page9 of 38
a. Reply: Again, Plaintiff offers no evidence that these "lurid details" were
included in the Joinder Motion, as indeed they were, and thus the fact that they were
should be deemed admitted.
13. Undisputed Fact 13: Plaintiff said after serving for four years as a "sex slave," she
"managed to escape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for
years." Id.at 3
a. Reply: Plaintiff does not dispute that she made this statement in her joinder
motion and it is admitted.
14. Undisputed Fact 14: Plaintiff suggested the government was part of Epstein's
"conspiracy" when it "secretly" negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Eptstein
precluding federal prosecution of Epstein and his "co-conspirators." The government's secrecy,
plaintiff alleged, was motivated by its fear that plaintiff would raise "powerful objections" to the
agreement that would have "shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other powerful
individuals. Id. at 6-7.
a. Reply: Plaintiff does not contest the quoted contents of the joinder motion, but
rather offers argument regarding Plaintiff's purported "belief." Plaintiff did not submit
an affidavit attesting to such "belief" and therefore no admissible evidence was cited or
offered. The facts should therefore be deemed admitted.
15. Undisputed Fact 15: Notably, the other "Jane Doe" who joined plaintiff's motion
who alleged she was sexually abused "many occasions" by Epstein was unable to corroborate
any of plaintiff's allegations. Id. at 7-8
Reply: Plaintiff states the facts are "untrue" but offers no admissible evidence
to support that statement. She has no affidavit or other statement from "the other 'Jane
8


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page10 of 38
Doe' (who was represented by Plaintiff's counsel, and therefore had the ability to furnish
such an affidavit). Indeed, Plaintiff acknowledges that the "other Jane Doe" "does not
know Ms. Giuffre." These facts must be deemed admitted.
I, who is NOT
the other Jane Doe, is irrelevant to the undisputed fact asserted. She also offers no
corroboration of the 'same pattern of abuse,' and in fact does not "remember" any such
facts, as already briefed. See Doc. 567 at 12-14.
16. Undisputed Fact 16: Also notably, in her multiple and lengthy consensual
interviews with Ms. Churcher three years earlier, plaintiff told Ms. Churcher of virtually none of
the details she described in the joinder motion. Exs. A-B.
Reply: Plaintiff's protestation aside, the Churcher articles (attached to Ms.
Churcher's sworn affidavit filed in this case at Doc. 216 and 216-1 through 216-8) fail to
include the vast majority of details included in Plaintiff's CVRA joinder motion, as any
side-by-side comparison will reveal. Plaintiff's simple facile response is that she "did
reveal details in 2011 consistent with those in the joinder motion." She offers no
admissible evidence of these details she "revealed" to Ms. Churcher, instead citing to a
heavily redacted interview she purportedly gave to the FBI, not Ms. Churcher. The
purported FBI report is itself hearsay, not to mention, redacted and prepared years after
any supposed interview of Plaintiff. McCawley Decl. Ex.31. Because Plaintiff offers no
admissible evidence to contradict the discrepancies between the Churcher articles and the
joinder motion, these facts should be deemed admitted.
17. Undisputed Fact 17: Ms. Maxwell's response to plaintiff's "lurid" accusations:
the January 2015 statement. As plaintiff and her lawyers expected, before District Judge Marra
in the CVRA action could strike the "lurid details" of plaintiff's allegations in the joinder
9


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page11 of 38
motion, members of the media obtained copies of the motion. Ex.G at 31:2-36:4 & Depo. Exs.
3-4.
a. Reply: Plaintiff cites no contrary evidence and therefore the facts should be
deemed admitted.
18. Undisputed Fact 18: At Mr. Barden's direction, on January 2, 2015, Mr. Gow sent
to numerous representatives of British media organizations an email containing "a quotable
statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell." Ex.F; Ex.G, at 33:8-23. The email was sent to more than 6
and probably less than 30 media representatives. See Ex.G, at 33:8-34:3. It was not sent to non-
media representatives. See id. at 31:2-35:21.
a. Reply: Plaintiff disputes as "blatant falsehood," without admissible evidence,
that it was Mr. Barden who directed that the January 2 email be sent to media
organizations. She then goes on to quote the very section of Mr. Gow's deposition in
which he surmises (but does not know, indicated by his statement it was his
"understanding") that it was something that had been sent to Maxwell by Barden.
Indeed, Mr. Barden clears up this confusion in his Declaration, in which he unequivocally
swore,
10. In liaison with Mr. Gow and my client, on January 2, 2015, 1 prepared a further
statement denying the allegations, and I instructed Mr. Gow to transmit it via email to members
of the British media who had made inquiry about plaintiff's allegations about Ms. Maxwell.
Attached as Exhibit Al is an email containing a true and correct copy of this statement. The
statement was issued on my authority. Although it is possible others suggested or contributed
content, I prepared the vast majority of the statement and ultimately approved and adopted all of
the statement as my work.
10


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page12 of 38
Ex.K 9 10. Mr. Gow's surmise as to how the statement was "forwarded to him" and by whom
does not controvert the sworn testimony of Mr. Barden himself. Again, without admissible
evidence to the contrary, the facts must be deemed admitted.
With regard to the number of media representatives to whom he sent the email, Mr. Gow
testified it was between 6 and 30. Ex.G at 33-34. His further testimony, offered by Plaintiff, that
he spoke to "over 30 journalists" does not contradict that statement. Nowhere does Plaintiff
offer testimony that he read the statement to over 30 journalists. Instead, Mr. Gow
acknowledged it was "very possible" that he had "ever read[] the statement to press or media
over the phone," not that he read it to "over 30 journalists." Plaintiff's selective cutting and
pasting undercuts her so called evidence that the facts in Paragraph 18 are "false," and thus they
ought be deemed admissible.
19. Undisputed Fact 19: Among the media representatives were Martin Robinson of
the Daily Mail; P. Peachey of The Independent; Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror; David Brown of
The Times; and Nick Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC; and David Mercer of the Press
Association. These representatives were selected based on their request—after the joinder motion
was filed
—for a response from Ms. Maxwell to plaintiff's allegations in the motion. See, e.g.,
Ex.G, at 30:23-35:21 & Depo.Ex.3.
a. Reply: While Plaintiff decries the second sentence as "false," her cited
evidence contradicts her conclusion. Mr. Gow testified that "any time there was an
incoming query it was either dealt with on the telephone by referring them back to the
two statements...or someone would email them the statement. So no one was left
unanswered." McCawley Decl., Ex.6 at 67. As his testimony makes clear, Mr. Gow sent
11


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page13 of 38
the statement to those journalists who made inquiry; he did not sent it to anyone who did
not. Based on the admissible evidence, this fact remains undisputed.
20. Undisputed Fact 20: The email to the media members read:
To Whom It May Concern,
Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell.
No further communication will be provided by her on this matter.
Thanks for your understanding.

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts-so not a new individual. The allegations made by
Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.
Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about
public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that
Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he
denies.
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not
publicised as news, as they are defamatory.
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains
he same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, whic
ave appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to see
redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.
Ex.F.
a. Reply: Plaintiff does not dispute the contents of the email and therefore it
should be deemed admitted.
21. Undisputed Fact 21: Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did
not intend it as a traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media. So he
intentionally did not pass it through a public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow's firm, Acuity
Reputation. EX.K 19 10,15.
12


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page14 of 38
a. Reply: Plaintiff makes two responses. As to the first sentence, she asserts
without evidentiary support that "the Court should not consider" the Barden Declaration.
This argument is frivolous for the reasons given on pages 8, 11-12, 18-19 of the Reply
Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment. It is a Declaration provided by an
attorney with knowledge of the facts, Mr. Barden, disclosed by Defendant in her Rule 26
witnesses, whom Plaintiff chose not to depose. As to the second sentence, Plaintiff offers
two pieces of evidence which she argues dispute the facts in question; they do not. That
Mr. Gow forwarded the statement, prepared by Mr. Barden, to the media is not disputed.
Rather, as Mr. Barden asserted in his declaration, and Plaintiff failed to cite contradictory
evidence, he was the one who prepared the vast majority of the statement and instructed
Mr. Gow to transmit it via email to members of the British media. Ex.K 19 10. He
likewise avers that he "did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press
release solely to disseminate information to the media [and] this is why I intentionally did
not request that Mr. Gow or any other public relations specialist prepare or participate in
preparing the statement." Id. at || 15. Plaintiff fails to contradict Mr. Barden's sworn
statement.
22. Undisputed Fact 22: The January 2015 statement served two purposes. First, Mr.
Barden intended that it mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell's reputation from the press's
republication of plaintiff's false allegations. He believed these ends could be accomplished by
suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject plaintiff's allegations to
inquiry and scrutiny. For example, he noted in the statement that plaintiff's allegations changed
dramatically over time, suggesting that they are "obvious lies" and therefore should not be
"publicised as news." Id. † 11.
13


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page15 of 38
a. Reply: This paragraph, eliciting Mr. Barden's intent, is uncontroverted by
Plaintiff. She fails to cite any contradictory admissible evidence, instead making legal
arguments. Her arguments are not admissible evidence (e.g., "it is her statement and she
directed that it be sent to the media and public," lacks any citation to record evidence).
Plaintiff's list of evidence she contends "corroborates" Plaintiff's claims should be
ignored as they do not pertain to Mr. Barden's purposes in drafting the January 2
statement.
23. Undisputed Fact 23: Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to
be "a shot across the bow" of the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish
plaintiff's allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement
he repeatedly noted that plaintiff's allegations were "defamatory." In this sense, the statement
was intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients
understand the seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's
obviously false allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. Id. 1 17.
a. Reply: Again, Plaintiff "disputes" Mr. Barden's intent without citation to
record evidence. Plaintiff claims that Barden did not "note" anything in the statement,
but the statement itself contains the phrase: "Ms. Roberts claims are obvious lies and
should be treated as such and not publicized as news, as they are defamatory."
Plaintiff's unsupported arguments should be ignored and these facts pertaining to Mr.
Barden's intent deemed admitted.
24. Undisputed Fact 24: Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow's emails
prefaced the statement with the following language: "Please find attached a quotable statement
on behalf of Ms Maxwell" (emphasis supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page16 of 38
time-only, comprehensive response quoted in full—to plaintiff's December 30, 2014,
allegations that would give the media Ms. Maxwell's response. Id. | 18. The purpose of the
prefatory statement was to inform the media-recipients of this intent. Id.
a. Reply: Plaintiff again "disputes" any statement related to Mr. Barden's purpose
or intent, but offers no evidence contradicting his purpose or intent. She simply points
out that Ms. Maxwell retained Mr. Gow in early 2015, and that he works for a public
relations firm, which is non-responsive to the fact at issue, i.e., Mr. Barden's intent with
respect to language included in the statement. No one has contested that it was Mr. Gow
who actually forwarded the statement to select members of the media who had requested
a response. The fact set forth should be deemed admitted.
25. Undisputed Fact 25: Plaintiff's activities to bring light to the rights of victims of
sexual abuse. Plaintiff has engaged in numerous activities to bring attention to herself, to the
prosecution and punishment of wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest
of bringing light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no evidence to dispute the facts cited and so they should
be deemed admitted.
26. Undisputed Fact 26: Plaintiff created an organization, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc.,
a Florida corporation, directly related to her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse. Doc.
1 (Complaint), 1 24-25.
Reply: Plaintiff does not dispute this statement.
27. Undisputed Fact 27: The "goal" of Victims Refuse Silence "was, and continues to
be, to help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by
15


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page17 of 38
victims of sexual abuse." Toward this end, plaintiff has "dedicated her professional life to
helping victims of sex trafficking." Id.
a. Reply: Plaintiff "agrees."
28. Undisputed Fact 28: Plaintiff repeatedly has sought out media organizations to
discuss her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse. This Reply Statement at 99l 51-54
(citing inter alia Doc. 216 19 2-11 and referenced exhibits, Doc. 261-1 to 216-8; Exs. N, KK,
LL, MM).
a. Reply: Plaintiff "denies" this contention, points to an email from Sharon
Churcher seeking to interview her, and asserts that it was the media that sought her out.
The weight of evidence, cited by Defendant at paragraphs 51-54, in addition to Plaintiff's
own documents, belie this assertion. She through her attorneys sought out a videotaped
interview with ABC News, she sent her "book manuscript" to publishers and literary
agents, and expressed anticipation and frustration that her "exclusive contract" with The
Mail prevented her for a period of time from marketing her book. See, e.g., ЕхнІвт QQ
at GIUFFRE003959.

Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page18 of 38
Plaintiff has disputed none of these activities she freely engaged in for years, and thus these
facts should be deemed admitted.
29. Undisputed Fact 29: On December 30, 2014, plaintiff publicly filed an "entirely
unnecessary" joinder motion laden with "unnecessary," "lurid details" about being "sexually
abused" as a "minor victim[]" by wealthy and famous men and being "trafficked" all around the
world as a "sex slave." Ex.J 9 24; Еx.K 11 2-3.
a. Reply: Plaintiff argues that her "lurid details" were necessary legally. Judge
Marra, however, has already held that they were not and her legal arguments,
unsupported by any actual evidence in this case, cannot serve to controvert his findings as
quoted.
30. Undisputed Fact 30: The plaintiff's alleged purpose in filing the joinder motion
was to "vindicate" her rights under the CVRA, expose the government's "secretly negotiated"
"non-prosecution agreement" with Epstein, "shed tremendous public light" on Epstein and "other
powerful individuals" that would undermine the agreement, and support the CVRA plaintiffs'
request for documents that would show how Epstein "used his powerful political and social
connections to secure a favorable plea deal" and the government's "motive" to aid Epstein and
his "co-conspirators." Ex.D, at 1, 6-7, 10 (emphasis supplied).
a. Reply: Plaintiff fails to offer any evidence to controvert the contents of her
CVRA Joinder Motion and thus, the fact should be deemed admitted.
31. Undisputed Fact 31: Plaintiff has written the manuscript of a book she has been
trying to publish detailing her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse and of sex
trafficking in Epstein's alleged "sex scheme." Ex.KK.
17


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page19 of 38
a. Reply: Plaintiff directs the Court to her response to paragraph 52 and suggests
the factual statement is misleading. She, however, offers no contradictory admissible
evidence and thus the fact should be deemed admitted.
32. Undisputed Fact 32: Republication alleged by plaintiff. Plaintiff was required by
Interrogatory No. 6 to identify any false statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell that were
"published globally, including within the Southern District of New York, as plaintiff alleged
in Paragraph 9 of Count I of her complaint. In response, plaintiff identified the January 2015
statement and nine instances in which various news media published portions of the January
2015 statement in news articles or broadcast stories. Ex.H, at 7-8; Ex.I, at 4.
a. Reply: Her argument aside, Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence to
controvert the interrogatory request and her response, which was limited to "nine
instances" in which the press published "portions of the January 2015 statement." For
example, Plaintiff does not point to a single news story that published the entirety of the
January 2015 statement. In the absence of contrary evidence, the fact should be deemed
admitted.
33. Undisputed Fact 33: In none of the nine instances was there any publication of the
entire January 2015 statement. Ex.H, at 7-8; Ex.I, at 4.
Reply: Plaintiff does not and cannot point to any of the nine publications she
disclosed, or any other publication, that published the entire January 2015 statement, and
this fact thus must be deemed admitted.
34. Undisputed Fact 34: Ms. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or authority
over any media organization, including the media identified in plaintiff's response to
18


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page20 of 38
Interrogatory No. 6, in connection with the media's publication of portions of the January 2015
statement. Ex.J 1|24; Ex.K 11 2-3.
a. Reply: Plaintiff's proffered evidence, testimony from Mr. Gow, fails to support
her argument and fails to controvert the Barden Declaration as cited by the defendant.
Nothing in the testimony establishes, as Plaintiff argues, that "Defendant hired Gow
because his position allowed him to influence the press to publish her defamatory
statement." The testimony is irrelevant to the factual point. The Gow testimony at most
relates to why Ms. Maxwell engaged Mr. Gow. It does not bear on the factual point, i.e.,
that Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Gow or Mr. Barden did not exercise any control or authority over
the media in the media's republication of portions of the statement. On this point plaintiff
has failed to introduce any contrary evidence. Accordingly, the fact should be deemed
admitted.
35. Undisputed Fact 35: Plaintiff's defamation action against Ms. Maxwell. Eight
years after Epstein's guilty plea, plaintiff brought this action, repeating many of the allegations
she made in her CVRA joinder motion. Doc. 1, 19.
a. Reply: Plaintiff "agrees."
36. Undisputed Fact 36: The complaint alleged that the January 2015 statement
"contained the following deliberate falsehoods":
(a) That Giuffre's sworn allegations "against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue."
(b) That the allegations have been "shown to be untrue."
(c) That Giuffre's "claims are obvious lies."
Doc. 1 930 (boldface and underscoring omitted).
(a) Reply: Plaintiff "agreed."
19


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page21 of 38
37. Undisputed Fact 37: Plaintiff lived independently from her parents with her
fiancé long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. After leaving the Growing Together drug
rehabilitation facility in 1999, plaintiff moved in with the family of a fellow patient. Ex.L at 7-8,
12-14. There she met, and became engaged to, her friend's brother, James Michael Austrich. Id.
and at 19. She and Austrich thereafter rented an apartment in the Ft. Lauderdale area with
another friend and both worked at various jobs in that area. Id. at 11, 13-17. Later, they stayed
briefly with plaintiff's parents in the Palm Beach/ Loxahatchee, Florida area before Austrich
rented an apartment for the couple on Bent Oak Drive in Royal Palm Beach. Id. at 17, 19, 25-27.
Although plaintiff agreed to marry Austrich, she never had any intention of doing so. Ex.N at
127-128.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers argument, without an affidavit or any other contradictory
evidence, regarding whether Plaintiff "voluntarily live[d] independently" or whether a
"reasonable person" could assert she was "engaged." Mr. Austrich and Plaintiff agreed
that they were engaged and testified accordingly, as cited. In the absence of admissible
evidence to the contrary, the facts as described by her fiancé in his deposition should be
deemed admitted.
38. Undisputed Fact 38: Plaintiff re-enrolled in high school from June 21, 2000
until March 7, 2002. After finishing the 9th grade school year at Forest Hills High School on
June 9, 1999, plaintiff re-enrolled at Wellington Adult High School on June 21, 2000, again on
August 16, 2000 and on August 14, 2001. Ex.O. On September 20, 2001, Plaintiff then enrolled
at Royal Palm Beach High School. Id. A few weeks later, on October 12, 2001, she matriculated
at Survivors Charter School. Id. Survivor's Charter School was an alternative school designed to
assist students who had been unsuccessful at more traditional schools. Ex.P at 23-24. Plaintiff
20


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page22 of 38
remained enrolled at Survivor's Charter School until March 7, 2002. Ex.O. She was present 56
days and absent 13 days during her time there. Id. Plaintiff never received her high school
diploma or GED. Ex. Q at 475, 483. Plaintiff and Figueroa went "back to school" together at
Survivor's Charter School. Ex.P at 23-27. The school day there lasted from morning until early
afternoon. Id. at 23-27, 144-146.
a. Reply: Plaintiff argues, again without evidentiary support, that the "codes" on
the school records indicate "semester start and end dates" rather than dates Plaintiff was
in school. Her mis-reading of the records is apparent from their face. One column is
labelled "Entry date," and the next "Withdrawal Date." Neither say "semester start date"
or "semester end" date. Moreover, the "codes" simply prove the point: Plaintiff
"entered" school (codes E01 and EA1) on the designated "entry date" and withdrew
(either prior to completion, to enter another training program, or who "will continue in
the class/program the next term or school year") on the dates designated "withdrawal."
The school records display entry and withdrawal dates for Wellington High School Adult
Program, from June 21, 2000 - August 15, 2000, from August 16, 2000 - August 13,
2001, and from August 14, 2001- September 20, 2001 and then an entry, that same day,
September 20, 2001 at Survivor's Charter School. Plaintiff would have one believe that
the records show a school on Plaintiff's official transcript that she never went to,
Wellington High School Adult Program, that indicates she withdrew the very day she
concededly entered Survivor's Charter School. Her intentional misreading of the record
is yet another attempt to obfuscate Plaintiff's lack of memory regarding where and when
she went to school, just like she failed to remember 8 jobs she held in 2000 whereas she
claimed to have had one. The test is admissible evidence to the contrary, and Plaintiff
21


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page23 of 38
offers none. The flight logs (which show trips in early 2001) do not contradict the
evidence because they are during the period of time she was enrolled in "Adult High
School," a place where night classes were taught and where one might circumstantially
infer, careful attendance records were not kept.
39. Undisputed Fact 39: During the year 2000, plaintiff worked at numerous jobs.
In 2000, while living with her fiancé, plaintiff held five different jobs: at Aviculture Breeding
and Research Center, Southeast Employee Management Company, The Club at Mar-a-Lago,
Oasis Outsourcing, and Neiman Marcus. Ex.R. Her taxable earnings that year totaled nearly
$9,000. Id. Plaintiff cannot now recall either the Southeast Employee Management Company or
the Oasis Outsourcing jobs. Ex.Q at 470-471.
a. Reply: Plaintiff does not dispute the facts as presented, merely argues regarding
their significance. The Social Security Administration records detail the five jobs at
which she worked in 2000; the month and day of the jobs are irrelevant for purposes of
this recitation of facts. Likewise, Plaintiff does not dispute the taxable earnings she made
that year, or that she does not "remember" the jobs associated with Southeast Employee
Management Company or Oasis Outsourcing (whether they were payroll or not), where
she made $3,212 and $2,037 that year. She also "forgot" about her job at Neiman
Marcus, where she made $1,440 in 2000, until she was confronted with the SSA records.
McCawley Dec. Ex.5 at 53, 470.
40. Undisputed Fact 40: Plaintiff's employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in
fall 2000. Plaintiff's father, Sky Roberts, was hired as a maintenance worker at the The Mar-a-
Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, beginning on April 11, 2000. Ex.S. Mr. Roberts worked
there year-round for approximately 3 years. Id.; Ex.T at 72-73. After working there for a period
22


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page24 of 38
of time, Mr. Roberts became acquainted with the head of the spa area and recommended plaintiff
for a job there. Id. at 72. Mar-a-Lago closes every Mother's Day and reopens on November 1.
Ex. U at Mar-a-Lago0212. Most of employees Mar-a-Lago, including all employees of the spa
area such as "spa attendants," are "seasonal" and work only when the club is open, i.e., between
November 1 and Mother's Day. Ex.T at 72-73; Ex.U at Mar-a-Lago0212; Ex. V. Plaintiff was
hired as a "seasonal" spa attendant to work at the Mar-a-Lago Club in the fall of 2000 after she
had turned 17.
a. Reply: Plaintiff's response is misleading. First, she does not dispute that Mr.
Roberts, her father began working at Mar-a-Lago in April 2000, nor that he worked there
for some time, became acquainted with the head of the spa area and recommended his
daughter for a job.
Second, Plaintiff contends that "job postings and job descriptions" "from 2002 and
later are irrelevant." There are no such "job postings" cited. Rather, the job posting cited
was from October 2000, the same time that Plaintiff was hired. Compare Ex. V (posting
for "Saturday October 14 and Sunday October 15") with calendar for year 2000, showing
Saturday and Sundays in October corresponding to those dates.
Finally, Plaintiff points to her own "recollection" as contrary proof. Her
"recollection" about when she worked at Mar-a-Lago has shifted dramatically over time.
First, she claimed it was 1998. See Jane Doe 102 complaint. Then, it was 1999. See
Doc. 1, Complaint in this matter. Now, in this response she has changed her answer to
2000. Her vague recollections about what year have been off base, no credit should be
given to her new found recollection of which month she worked there. In any event, she
presents no admissible credible evidence to contradict Mar-a-Lago's own records. Ex.U
23


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page25 of 38
at Mar-a-Lago0212 (spa not open from Mother's Day until November 1). Even
Plaintiff's father, a longtime employee of Mar-a-lago admitted that the place "closed
down" in the summer. Ex.T at 72-73. Plaintiff simply is not credible in her testimony
that she recalls it being a "summer job," and the fact that she did not work at the spa until
at least November 2000 at the age of 17 should be deemed admitted.
41. Undisputed Fact 41: Plaintiff represented herself as a masseuse for Jeffrey
Epstein. While working at the Mar-a-Lago spa and reading a library book about massage,
plaintiff met Ms. Maxwell. Plaintiff thereafter told her father that she got a job working for
Jeffrey Epstein as a masseuse. Ex.T at 79. Plaintiff's father took her to Epstein's house on one
occasion around that time, and Epstein came outside and introduced himself to Mr. Roberts. Id.
at 82-83. Plaintiff commenced employment as a traveling masseuse for Mr. Epstein. Plaintiff
was excited about her job as a masseuse, about traveling with him and about meeting famous
people. Ex.L at 56; Ex.P at 126. Plaintiff represented that she was employed as a masseuse
beginning in January 2001. Ex.M; Ex.N. Plaintiff never mentioned Ms. Maxwell to her then-
fiancé, Austrich. Ex.L at 74. Plaintiff's father never met Ms. Maxwell. Ex. T at 85.
a. Reply: Plaintiff does not actually refute any of the facts set forth above, but
rather spends her time discussing different facts. Plaintiff's father testified to what she
told him, that she "was going to learn massage therapy." Ex. T at 79. She does not
contest her father's testimony that Mr. Epstein came out of the house and greeted her
father and that her father never met Ms. Maxwell. See Reply to Undisputed Fact 41.
Whether someone can receive a "massage license" under Florida law without a high
school equivalency diploma is of no moment. Plaintiff does not dispute she represented
24


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page26 of 38
herself as a masseuse to others, in her own handwriting, beginning in January 2001. Exs.
M and N. These facts should be deemed admitted.
42. Undisputed Fact 42: Plaintiff resumed her relationship with convicted felon
Anthony Figueroa. In spring 2001, while living with Austrich, plaintiff lied to and cheated on
him with her high school boyfriend, Anthony Figueroa. Ex.L at 68, 72. Plaintiff and Austrich
thereafter broke up, and Figueroa moved into the Bent Oak apartment with plaintiff. Ex.L at 20;
Ex.P at 28. When Austrich returned to the Bent Oak apartment to check on his pets and retrieve
his belongings, Figueroa in Plaintiff's presence punched Austrich in the face. face. Ex. L at 38-
45. Figueroa and plaintiff fled the scene before police arrived. Ex.X. Figueroa was then a
convicted felon and a drug abuser on probation for possession of a controlled substance. Ex.Y.
a. Reply: Plaintiff argues relevance regarding these facts, but contests none of
them. They should be deemed admitted. Plaintiff's lies, cheating, and association with a
convicted felon and known drug abuser all are relevant in this defamation case
concerning her reputation, purported damage to such reputation, and whether she was a
known liar, as the January 2015 statement contends.
43. Undisputed Fact 43: Plaintiff freely and voluntarily contacted the police to
come to her aid in 2001 and 2002 but never reported to them that she was Epstein's "sex
slave." In August 2001 at age 17, while living in the same apartment, plaintiff and Figueroa
hosted a party with a number of guests. Ex.Z. During the party, according to plaintiff, someone
entered plaintiff's room and stole $500 from her shirt pocket. Id. Plaintiff contacted the police.
She met and spoke with police officers regarding the incident and filed a report. She did not
disclose to the officer that she was a "sex slave." A second time, in June 2002, plaintiff
contacted the police to report that her former landlord had left her belongings by the roadside and
25


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page27 of 38
had lit her mattress on fire. Ex.AA. Again, plaintiff met and spoke with the law enforcement
officers but did not complain that she was the victim of any sexual trafficking or abuse or that
she was then being held as a "sex slave." Id.
a. Reply: Plaintiff, again, presents no admissible evidence to contradict these
facts, instead arguing their relevance. They should be deemed admitted.
44. From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein and Maxwell were almost
entirely absent from Florida on documented travel unaccompanied by Plaintiff. Flight logs
maintained by Epstein's private pilot Dave Rodgers evidence the substantial number of trips
away from Florida that Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Plaintiff, between August
2001 and September 2002. Ex.BB. Rodgers maintained a log of all flights on which Epstein and
Maxwell traveled with him. Ex.CC at 6-15. Epstein additionally traveled with another pilot who
did not keep such logs and he also occasionally traveled via commercial flights. Id. at 99-100,
103. For substantially all of thirteen months of the twenty-two months (from November 2000
until September 2002) that Plaintiff lived in Palm Beach and knew Epstein, Epstein was
traveling outside of Florida unaccompanied by Plaintiff. Ex.BB. During this same period of
time, Plaintiff was employed at various jobs, enrolled in school, and living with her boyfriend.
a. Reply: Plaintiff goes to great lengths to dispute facts other than those presented
as Undisputed Fact 44. Her voluminous, repetitive recitation of the flights that Plaintiff
was on do nothing to demonstrate the 13 months of flights from July 2001 until August
2002 that Epstein and Maxwell were on without Plaintiff, as reflected in the logs. Her
assertions regarding the other flights that she took, commercial or on another plane, do
nothing to establish all of the many flights she was not on during 13 of the 22 month
period during which Epstein and Maxwell were away from Palm Beach. Plaintiff does
26


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page28 of 38
not dispute that Epstein and Maxwell were on the flights without her. The facts as
presented by Defendant should be deemed admitted.
45. Undisputed Fact 45: Plaintiff and Figueroa shared a vehicle during 2001 and
2002. Plaintiff and Figueroa shared a '93 white Pontiac in 2001 and 2002. Ex.P at 67; Ex.EE.
Plaintiff freely traveled around the Palm Beach area in that vehicle. Id. In August 2002, Plaintiff
acquired a Dodge Dakota pickup truck from her father. Ex.P at 67-68. Figueroa used that
vehicle in a series of crimes before and after Plaintiff left for Thailand. Id.; Ex.FF.
a. Reply: Again, the Response has nothing to do with the facts stated. As Plaintiff
concedes, she and Mr. Figueroa had one car that they both used. In fact, they traveled to
and from school together. Ex.P at 67-68. She also does not dispute that she traveled
freely around the Palm Beach area in that vehicle, or that "her car" was used in a series of
thefts while she was in Thailand. All should be deemed admitted.
46. Undisputed Fact 46: Plaintiff held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002. During
2001 and 2002, plaintiff was gainfully employed at several jobs. She worked as a waitress at
Mannino's Restaurant, at TGIFriday's restaurant (aka CCI of Royal Palm Inc.), and at
Roadhouse Grill. Ex.R. She also was employed at Courtyard Animal Hospital (aka Marc
Pinkwasser DVM). Id.; Ex.W.
a. Reply: Plaintiff admits all of the facts set forth above, aside from the use of the
word "gainfully." They should be deemed admitted.
47. Undisputed Fact 47: In September 2002, Plaintiff traveled to Thailand to
receive massage training and while there, met her future husband and eloped with him.
Plaintiff traveled to Thailand in September 2002 to receive formal training as a masseuse.
Figueroa drove her to the airport. While there, she initially contacted Figueroa frequently,
27


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page29 of 38
incurring a phone bill of $4,000. Ex.P at 35. She met Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and
decided to marry him. She thereafter ceased all contact with Figueroa from October 2002 until
two days before Mr. Figueroa's deposition in this matter in May 2016. Id. at 29, 37.
a. Reply: Again, Plaintiff does not refute the facts set forth, she simply offers her
own interpretation of those facts. In the absence of any contrary evidence, they should be
deemed admitted.
48. Undisputed Fact 48: Detective Recarey's investigation of Epstein failed to
uncover any evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual
trafficking or production or possession of child pornography. Joseph Recarey served as the
lead detective from the Palm Beach Police Department charged with investigating Jeffrey
Epstein. Ex.GG at 10. That investigation commenced in 2005. Id. Recarey worked only on the
Epstein case for an entire year. Id. at 274. He reviewed previous officers' reports and interviews,
conducted numerous interviews of witnesses and alleged victims himself, reviewed surveillance
footage of the Epstein home, participated in and had knowledge of the search warrant executed
on the Epstein home, and testified regarding the case before the Florida state grand jury against
Epstein. Id. at 212-215. Detective Recarey's investigation revealed that not one of the alleged
Epstein victims ever mentioned Ms. Maxwell's name and she was never considered a suspect by
the government. Id. at 10-11, 180-82, 187-96, 241-42, 278. None of Epstein's alleged victims
said they had seen Ms. Maxwell at Epstein's house, nor said they had been "recruited by her,"
nor paid any money by her, nor told what to wear or how to act by her. Id. Indeed, none of
Epstein's alleged victims ever reported to the government they had met or spoken to Ms.
Maxwell. Maxwell was not seen coming or going from the house during the law enforcement
surveillance of Epstein's home. Id. at 214-215. The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell
28


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page30 of 38
and her name was never mentioned before the grand jury. Id. at 203, 211. No property belonging
to Maxwell, including "sex toys" or "child pornography," was seized from Epstein's home
during execution of the search warrant. Id. at 257. Detective Recarey, when asked to describe
"everything that you believe you know about Ghislaine Maxwell's sexual trafficking conduct,"
replied, "I don't." Id. at 278. He confirmed he has no knowledge about Ms. Maxwell sexually
trafficking anybody. Id. at 278-79. Detective Recarey also has no knowledge of Plaintiff's
conduct that is subject of this lawsuit. Id. at 259-260.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers several misleading "contrary" facts, none of which
actually address the facts presented herein, namely whether Ms. Maxwell was ever
mentioned by any of Epstein's alleged victims, whether she was the target of their
investigation, and whether any of her property was seized from Epstein's home. Plaintiff
cites to numerous inadmissible pieces of evidence on facts other than those. Mr.
Rodriguez, a convicted felon for obstructing justice related to the Epstein case, is dead
and his deposition testimony is the subject of a motion in limine because Ms. Maxwell
has never had the opportunity to cross examine him. Doc. 567 at 14. Ms. Rabuyo
likewise is not a witness who has been deposed in this case, and therefore her
"testimony" is not admissible against Ms. Maxwell. The message pads are not
authenticated by anyone, as will be the subject of a forthcoming motion in limine. And
there is not one shred of evidence that any child pornography, as opposed to a topless
photo of a very adult Ms. Maxwell, were ever found in Epstein's home. The facts should
be deemed admitted, as those proferred by Defendant are based on admissible evidence.
49. Undisputed Fact 49: No nude photograph of Plaintiff was displayed in
Epstein's home. Epstein's housekeeper, Juan Alessi, "never saw any photographs of Virginia
29


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page31 of 38
Roberts in Mr. Epstein's house. " Ex. HH at | 17. Detective Recarey entered Epstein's home in
2002 to install security cameras to catch a thief and did not observe any "child pornography"
within the home, including on Epstein's desk in his office. Ex.GG at 289-90.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offered no evidence that a nude photograph of her was
displayed in Epstein's home. All of the testimony she submits has nothing to do with a
nude photograph of herself. The fact should be deemed admitted.
50. Undisputed Fact 50: Plaintiff intentionally destroyed her "journal" and
"dream journal" regarding her "memories" of this case in 2013 while represented by
counsel. Plaintiff drafted a "journal" describing individuals to whom she claims she was sexually
trafficked as well as her memories and thoughts about her experiences with Epstein. Ex.II at 64-
65, 194; Ex.N at 205-08. In 2013, she and her husband created a bonfire in her backyard in
Florida and burned the journal together with other documents in her possession. Id. Plaintiff also
kept a "dream journal" regarding her thoughts and memories that she possessed in January 2016.
Ex.II at 194-96. To date, Plaintiff cannot locate the "dream journal." Id.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no contrary admissible regarding her destruction of her
journal and it should be deemed admitted.
51. Undisputed Fact 51: Plaintiff publicly peddled her story beginning in 2011.
Plaintiff granted journalist Sharon Churcher extensive interviews that resulted in seven (7)
widely distributed articles from March 2011 through January 2015. Doc. 216 11 2-11 and
referenced exhibits; Doc. 261-1 to 216-8, incorporated by reference. Churcher regularly
communicated with plaintiff and her "attorneys or other agents" from "early 2011" to "the
present day." Plaintiff received approximately $160,000 for her stories and pictures that were
published by many news organizations. Ex.N at 247-248.

Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page32 of 38
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no evidence to contradict the facts asserted and they
should therefore be deemed admitted. Plaintiff's unsupported spin of those facts should
be stricken.
52. Undisputed Fact 52: Plaintiff drafted a 144-page purportedly autobiographical
book manuscript in 2011 which she actively sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous
with her Churcher interviews, plaintiff drafted a book manuscript which purported to document
plaintiff's experiences as a teenager in Florida, including her interactions with Epstein and
Maxwell. Ex.KK. Plaintiff communicated with literary agents, ghost writers and potential
independent publishers in an effort to get her book published. She generated marketing materials
and circulated those along with book chapters to numerous individuals associated with
publishing and the media.
a. Reply: Plaintiff cites inadmissible evidence, and attorney argument, in
contradiction of these facts. They should be ignored. The "Victim Notification Letter" is
inadmissible hearsay. The psychologist records likewise are inadmissible hearsay. The
FBI interview is inadmissible hearsay. Plaintiff's counsel then flatly misrepresents to the
Court her own client's characterization of the book manuscript, calling it a "fictionalized
account." Plaintiff, contradicting her counsel, testified that the book manuscript is "99%
true."
Q Is there anything -- well, first of all, did you author that entire manuscript?
A Yes, I did.
Q Did anyone else author part of that manuscript?
A Do you mean did anyone else write this with me?
Q Right.
A No.
Q That's all your writing?
31


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page33 of 38
A This is my writing.
Q Okay. To the best of your recollection as you sit here right now, is there anything
in that manuscript about Ghislaine Maxwell that is untrue?
A I don't believe so. Like I said, there is a lot of stuff that I actually have left out of
here.
Q Um-hum.
A. So there is a lot more information I could put in there. But as far as
Ghislaine Maxwell goes, I would like to say that there is 99.9 percent of it would
be to the correct knowledge.
Q All right. Is there anything that you -- and I understand you're doing this from
memory. Is there anything that you recall, as you're sitting here today, about
Ghislaine Maxwell that is contained in that manuscript, that is not true?
A You know, I haven't read this in a very long time. I don't believe that there's
anything in here about Ghislaine Maxwell that is not true.
EXHIBIT RR at 42-43 (emphasis added).
Plaintiff clearly now would like to spin the book manuscript as "fictionalized" because
she is well aware that the "facts" presented by her in that manuscript are contradicted by many
other documentary and testimonial records. Yet she offers no admissible evidence that Plaintiff
intended the manuscript to be fictional. Citations to social scientists who have not testified in
this case and whose work has not even be cited by any expert in this case is wholly improper and
should be stricken.
53. Undisputed Fact 53: Plaintiff's publicly filed "lurid" CVRA pleadings initiated
a media frenzy and generated highly publicized litigation between her lawyers and Alan
Dershowitz. On December 30, 2014, plaintiff, through counsel, publicly filed a joinder motion
that contained her "lurid allegations" about Ms. Maxwell and many others, including Alan
Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, Jean-Luc Brunel. The joinder motion was followed by a
"corrected" motion (Ex.D) and two further declarations in January and February 2015, which
repeated many of plaintiff's claims. These CVRA pleadings generated a media maelstrom and
spawned highly publicized litigation between plaintiff's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, and Alan
32


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page34 of 38
Dershowitz. After plaintiff publicly alleged Mr. Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr.
Dershowitz vigorously defended himself in the media. He called plaintiff a liar and accused her
lawyers of unethical conduct. In response, attorneys Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz who
counterclaimed. This litigation, in turn, caused additional media attention by national and
international media organizations. Doc. 363 at 363-1 through 363-14.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no contrary facts and so they should be deemed
admitted.
54. Undisputed Fact 54: Plaintiff formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to
attract publicity and speak out on a public controversy. In 2014, plaintiff, with the assistance
of the same counsel, formed a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to
plaintiff, the purpose of the organization is to promote plaintiff's professed cause against sex
slavery. The stated goal of her organization is to help survivors surmount the shame, silence,
and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse. Ex. LL. Plaintiff attempts to
promote Victims Refuse Silence at every opportunity. Ex.MM at 17-18. For example, plaintiff
participated in an interview in New York with ABC to promote the charity and to get her mission
out to the public. Id. at 28.
a. Reply: Plaintiff offers no contrary evidence and the facts should be deemed
admitted.
II. The Court should strike plaintiff's statement of "undisputed facts."
The summary-judgment procedure is well established. When the summary-judgment non-
movant bears the burden of proof at trial, as in the case at bar, the movant may show a prima
facie entitlement to summary judgment in one of two ways: (1) the movant may point to
evidence that negates the non-movant's claims, or (2) the movant may identify those portions of
its opponent's evidence that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.
33


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page35 of 38
Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 272-73 (2d Cir. 2006). If the movant makes this showing in
either manner, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to identify record evidence creating a genuine
issue of material fact. Id. at 273.
Local Civil Rule 56.1(a) carries out this summary-judgment procedure by requiring the
summary-judgment movant to set forth "material facts as to which she contends there is no
genuine issue to be tried." Subsection (b) of the rule requires the party opposing summary
judgment to set forth a "statement of additional material facts as to which it is contended that
there exists a genuine issue to be tried' (emphasis supplied).
Ms. Maxwell has moved for summary judgment; plaintiff has not. As movant,
Ms. Maxwell is required under Local Civil Rule 56.1 to enumerate the facts she is asserting as
undisputed; as the party opposing summary judgment, plaintiff is permitted-if she can to
introduce admissible evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact. See Fed. R. Civ. P.
56(c) (1).
Plaintiff is confused. Plaintiff believes shethe party opposing summary judgment—
must enumerate facts she is asserting as undisputed, and so she has submitted her own Rule 56.1
statement of "undisputed facts." That gets the summary-judgment procedure exactly backwards.
Plaintiff s "undisputed facts" are irrelevant. Plaintiff cannot avoid summary judgment by
proposing "undisputed facts"; she may only do so by creating a genuine issue of material fact as
to Ms. Maxwell's statement of undisputed facts. Accordingly, this Court should strike plaintiff's
statement of "undisputed facts."
Although Ms. Maxwell as the summary-judgment movant has no duty to respond to
plaintiff's alleged "undisputed facts," we hasten to add that Ms. Maxwell in fact opposes and
disputes most of plaintiff's alleged "undisputed facts." For example, Defendant's Undisputed
34


Case 18-2868, Document 284, 08/09/2019, 2628244, Page36 of 38
Fact 40 includes the statement, "Ms. Giuffre was hired as a 'seasonal' spa attendant to work at
the Mar-a-Lago Club in the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17." Yet, Plaintiff sets forth as her
own "Undisputed Fact 58" that "Virginia [got] job at Mar-a-Lago in 2000, either months before
or just after [her] 17" birthday." Plaintiff has done nothing more than set forth her "dispute"
with Defendant's Undisputed Fact 40 as her own "undisputed fact." It makes no sense. See also
Plaintiff's "Undisputed Fact" 63. The other alleged undisputed facts are simply Plaintiff's
assertion of her deposition testimony, and hearsay of her statements to other witnesses, couched
as "Undisputed Facts." Ms. Maxwell strenuously disputes almost all of the alleged "undisputed
facts" claiming that she engaged in any sexual acts, misconduct or communications with plaintiff
or others; indeed, over the course of two days and thirteen hours of deposition Ms. Maxwell
disputed all such allegations.
Because none of Plaintiff's "undisputed facts" have anything to do with the issues raised
by Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Ms. Maxwell moves to strike plaintiff's
statement of "undisputed facts."
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court deem her Undisputed
Facts admitted, and that the Court strike plaintiff's statement of "undisputed facts."

Declaration of Laura A. Menninger in Support of
Defendant's Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment
I, Laura A. Menninger, declare as follows:
1. I am an attorney at law duly licensed in the State of New York and admitted to
practice in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. I am a
member of the law firm Haddon, Morgan & Foreman, P.C., counsel of record for Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell in this action. I respectfully submit this Declaration in support of
Ms. Maxwell's Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment.'
2.
In Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment
(filed Jan. 9, 2017), I included numbered paragraphs corresponding to undisputed facts from the
movant's perspective as contemplated by Local Civil Rule 56.1(a), together with the citation to
admissible evidence as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). See Doc. 541, passim.
'At trial, defendant intends to produce either the custodian of record relevant to any
disputed document or a certification in compliance with either Fed. R. Evid. P. 803 and/or 902.
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Apart from deposition testimony, the majority of non-deposition
documents herein were either produced by plaintiff or obtained with releases signed by plaintiff.

("Statement"). Those paragraphs mirror the numbered paragraphs contained within the
Memorandum of Law, minus the citations to the evidentiary record. The Statement was filed
with the Court in hard-copy and placed in the vault (see Doc.543).
4. Through a clerical oversight, a redacted version of the Statement was not appended

as noted in the previous two paragraphs, Ms. Maxwell enumerated all undisputed facts in
accordance with Local Civil Rule 56.1(a) in:
• Ms. Maxwell's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment
(Doc.541); and
• the Local Rule 56.1 Statement served on the the Court and counsel and filed in hard
copy with the Court.

Hi Jarred
Hopefully you have Virginia's book pitch by now.
She has some amazing names which she can share with you in confidence and I think she also has a human interest
story that could appeal to the Oprah/female set as well as the Wall Streeters who follow Epstein - a hedge fund king.
Here are a few of our stories about Virginia, plus some examples of the massive US and other international media
pickup. Vanity Fair are doing a piece I believe in their August issue. The FBI have reopened the Epstein case due to
Virginia's revelations. I also am attaching a link to a NY Magazine profile of Epstein..... written before his world
combusted. The FBI believe he was essentially running a private - and mobile - brothel for some of the world's richest
and most influential men.
He got off the first time round after retaining Kenneth Starr (who witchhunted Bill Clinton) and Alan Dershowitz (von
Bulow's appeal lawyer, who inspired the movie Reversal of Fortune). The US Justice Dept is investigating corruption
allegations against at least one prosecutor involved in the case.
Best regards,
Sharon

didn't see them take pictures of the backs of them.
I'm not too sure who.
You don't remember sending to them a
photograph that included this wood around another
photograph?
A
No.
okay. You have mentioned a journalist by
the name of Sharon Churcher.
A
Yes.
You are aware that Sharon Churcher
published news stories about you?
A
Yes.
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
Go ahead.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Is anything that you
have read in Sharon Churcher's news stories about you
untrue?
A
I think Sharon did print some things that
I think she elaborated or maybe misheard. But, I
mean, if you have a specific document to show me, I'd
love to look at it and read it and tell you what I
think.
Is there anything, as you sit here today,
that you know of that Sharon Churcher printed about
you that is not true?

A
Not off the top of my head. If you show
me, like, a news clipping article or something, I can
definitely read it for you.
Is there anything that you know of that
Sharon Churcher has printed about Ghislaine Maxwell
that is not true?
A
No, not off -- no, not off the top of my
head.
Is there anything that you recall saying
to Sharon Churcher that she then printed something
different than what you had said to her?
A
Yeah, I've read stuff. I mean, I just --
I can't remember what, but I read something that I
think was, Oh, she got that wrong. I can't remember
an exact example off the top of my head.
Did you ever complain to Sharon Churcher
about things that she got wrong?
A
I didn't see a point. I might have, but
I - I didn't see a point really because it's already
printed, you know.
You had a fairly voluminous set of
communications with Sharon Churcher by e-mail,
correct?
A
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
Voluminous, like a lot of them?

(BY MS. MENNINGER) Yes.
A
Yes.
And during any of those communications, do
you know whether she printed things about you after
you had any of those communications?
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
A
I don't know. I know a lot of stuff was
printed, and I never really stopped to read who
printed the article, or wrote the article, I should
say. Sorry.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. I'll show you
Defendant's Exhibit 7.
(Exhibit 7 marked.)
THE DEPONENT: Thank you.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) I'll let you read
through the statements on the first page there, and
if there is anything that is not absolutely true,
just put a check by it and we'll come back to it.
A
It's not very clear how she wrote it. "I
flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine
Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black
helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her."
That wasn't an eyewitness statement.
Like, I didn't see her do it. Ghislaine was the one
who told me about that; that she's the one who flew

Bill.
All right. If you just want to put a
check by it, then we'll just come back and talk about
each one.
A
Okay.
Just to move things along.
A
Okay. I have made three checkmarks.
All right.
MS. MCCAWLEY: And I just -- before you
continue, I just want to identify for the record,
since this doesn't have any identifiers on it, are
you representing that these are statements from
Sharon Churcher?
MS. MENNINGER: I'm not representing
anything. I'm asking the witness questions about
these statements. I asked her is anything on here
not true. That's all I asked her.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) So which ones did you
put checkmarks by, Ms.
Giuffre?
A
I'd have been -- I'm sorry.
"I'd have
been about 17 at the time. I flew to the Caribbean
with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick
up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had
bought her."
Okay. And what else did you put a check

by?
A
"I used to get frightened flying with her
but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I
remember him talking about what a good job" --
sorry - "job she did."
Okay. And what else did you put a check
by?
"Donald Trump was also a good friend of
Jeffrey's. He didn't partake in any sex with any of
us but he flirted with me. He'd laugh and tell
Jeffrey, 'you've got the life.'"'
Other than the three you've just
mentioned --
A
Yeah.
-- everything else on here is absolutely
accurate?
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
A
Yes. Well, to the best of my
recollection, yes.
(BY MS. MENNINGER)
All right. What is
inaccurate about, "I'd have been about 17 at the
time. I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then
Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge
black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her"?
A
Because it makes it kind of sound like an

eyewitness thing.
Okay. Did you say that statement to
Sharon Churcher?
A
I said to Sharon that Ghislaine told me
that she flew Bill in the heli- -- the black
helicopter that Jeffrey bought her, and I just wanted
to clarify that I didn't actually see her do that. I
heard from Ghislaine that she did that.
You heard that from Ghislaine, and then
you reported to Sharon Churcher that you had heard
that from Ghislaine.
A
Correct.
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
A
I heard a lot of things from Ghislaine
that sounded too true -- too outrageous to be true,
but you never knew what to believe, so...
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. And after
Sharon Churcher printed what she said you said, did
you complain to her that it was inaccurate?
A
I might have verbally with her, but again,
I didn't see a point in making a hissy over it
because what was done was done. She had already
printed.
what was inaccurate about, "I used to get
frightened flying with her but Bill" said -- "had the

A
I just don't remember saying that to her.
I don't remember saying I remember him talking about
what a good job she did.
All right.
A
I just don't remember that at all.
okay. And I guess, just to be clear, my
questions wasn't do you remember saying this to
Sharon Churcher; my question is, is that statement
accurate?
MS. MCCAWLEY: well, objection.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Did you used to get
frightened flying with her?
A
Yes.
Okay. Did Bill have the Secret Service
with him?
A
They were there, but not like on the --
not where we were eating.
Do you remember Bill talking about what a
good job she did?
A
I don't remember that.
So what is inaccurate about that
statement?

I just -- it's inaccurate because I don't

I don't remember that.
Does it inaccurately suggest that Bill had
the Secret Service with him on a helicopter?
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
A
Well, not being an eyewitness to it, I
wouldn't be able to tell you. I can't tell you what
I don't know.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) And do you believe you
said that statement to Sharon Churcher?
A
I mean, Sharon and I talked a lot, and if
she misheard me or just wrote it in the way that she
thought she should, I have no control over that. So
I'm not too sure.
A
Did she record your interviews?
Some of them. Some of them she didn't. I
mean, we, like - we, like, met for like a week, and
we spent a lot of time together, and then even after
that we just continued, like, kind of a friendship.
All right. What's inaccurate about the
last statement on that page?
"Donald Trump was also a good friend of
Jeffrey's." That part is true.
"He didn't partake in any" of -- "any sex
with any of us but he flirted with me." It's true

that he didn't partake in any sex with us, and but
it's not true that he flirted with me. Donald Trump
never flirted with me.
Then the next sentence is, "He'd laugh and
tell Jeffrey, 'you've got the life.''' I never said
that to her.
when you say, "he didn't partake in any
sex with any of us, " who is "us"?
A
Girls. Just --
How do you know who Donald Trump -- Trump
had sex with?
A
oh, I didn't physically see him have sex
with any of the girls, so I can't say who he had sex
with in his whole life or not, but I just know it
wasn't with me when I was with other girls.
And who were the other girls that you were
with in Donald Trump's presence?
A
None. There - I worked for Donald Trump,
and I've met him probably a few times.
When have you met him?
A
At Mar-a-Lago. My dad and him, I wouldn't
say they were friends, but my dad knew him and they
would talk all the time -- well, not all the time but
when they saw each other.

A
NO.
What is the basis for your statement that
Donald Trump is a good friend of Jeffrey's?
A
Jeffrey told me that Donald Trump is a
good friend of his.
But you never observed them together?
A
No, not that I can actually remember. I
mean, not off the top of my head, no.
when did Donald Trump flirt with you?
He didn't. That's what's inaccurate.
Did you ever see Donald Trump at Jeffrey's
home?

Not that I can remember.
On his island?
A
No, not that I can remember.

No, not that I can remember.

second page and read through those. Let me know if
any of those are inaccurate. Just put a check by
them and then we'll come back.

MS. MCCAWLEY: Before you go, Virginia,
I'm going to object to the use of the second page of
this document. There's no time frame on it. There's
no source reference to it, so it's entirely unclear
where this has come from.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. Are you done?
A
Yes.
Okay. What's the first one you've put a
check by?
A
"The hammock photo was all over the
houses, " in parentheses. And Bill Clinton and -- I'm
sorry, "Bill Clinton and Andrew," in parentheses,
"had to have seen it."
"All over the houses" is not my statement
and an exaggeration. They did have that picture in
the houses. And I believe, if I remember the
conversation correctly, she asked, Could have Bill
Clinton and Andrew seen the picture? And I said,
Yes, it's possible that they could have seen it.
So, I mean, it's just that -- it's not
that it's totally inaccurate. I just think it's like
journalist writing, had to have seen it. It doesn't
mean they saw it. I just think that if it was in
front of them, they would have seen it.
So she told you that -- you told her that

the photograph was in the houses -- houses?
A
Yes. I know he had it in New York on his
desk. I know he had it in Palm Beach. I know he had
it in the Caribbean. And I don't know if he had it
in New Mexico. I can't remember New Mexico. Maybe.
Where in Palm Beach was the photograph?
A
The massage room.
Was that -- you did not say that they --
it was all over the houses?
A
Correct. All over the houses would imply
that it's everywhere in the house, so...
You did not say that Andrew and Clinton
had to have seen the photograph?
A
Correct. I -- it was more of a, if they
were in front of it, they would have seen it, kind of
a thing. I'm not saying it right. But it wasn't,
like, had to have seen it.
All right. What's the next statement that
you put a check by?
A
I'm sorry, excuse me. My kids shared a
beautiful cough with me again.
"I spent four years as a millionaire's
personal masseuse."
A
What is inaccurate about that statement?

that Mar-a-Lago was able to provide for us, that it
was not four years.
How many years was it?
A
More like 2-1/2, I think, if I'm right, or
two. I'm sorry, I'm really bad at math. But yes,
the two period.
What's the next statement that you have
put a check by?
A
"I was a pedophile's dream." I think she
took that out of context and made that her own little
headline.
Did you say that to her?
A
I said something along the line like, I --
the -- the pedos loved me because I would do
everything that they wanted for them. But do I think
that - yeah, I -- I know she made that line up
herself, the pedos -- pedophile's dream.
What's the next one you put a check by?
A
I put a question mark next to the next
one. It says, "Three years later she was reunited
with her family." I don't know what that pertains
to. I don't know what timeline that means.
Was there a period of three years where
you were not with your family?
A
There's been longer periods than that

that -- when I wasn't with my family. That's what I
mean, I don't understand where that comes from.
"Three years later she was reunited with her family."
Prior to 2002, was there a period of three
years where you were not with your family?
A
No.
Okay. Did you say to Sharon Churcher,
three years later, she was reunited with her family?
A
That's what I don't understand. I don't
even know what that time periods pertains to.
Do you recall saying that to Sharon
Churcher?
A
No.
What's the next one you put a check by?
A
"After about two years he started to ask
me to entertain his friends."
What's wrong with that statement?
A
It wasn't two years. I don't know where
she got that from.
Okay. How long was it?
A
Like, I can't give you an exact time
period, but it wasn't right in the beginning. It was
after my training, or so to speak training. So, I
mean, my best guesstimate would be anywhere between
four to six months.

the island to entertain him, massage him and make him
feel how you make me feel"?
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
Go ahead.
A
I do remember him saying that, and I think
that's more of a general- -- generalization for all
the times that I was sent to the -- where is this -
the island to entertain people. And that would be a
quote that she made but from my words saying that's
what he said to me when I had to go be with these
people that he sent me to.

sentence to her?

I -- I can't remember. Like I said, I
think it's more of a generalization.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Did you meet Al Gore?
A
Yes.
Did you meet Heidi Klum?
A
Yes.
Did you meet Naomi Campbell?
A
Yes.
Did you go on a six-week trip with Epstein
in 2001?
A
Yeah. Yes.
Sorry.
when in 2001 did you go on a six-week trip
with him?
A
I don't remember exactly when it was, but
it's that -- it's the one where we went to Tangier,
Morocco, England. I can't remember where else we
went. France.
Did the FBI tell you that Epstein had
hidden cameras watching you the entire time, even
when you were in the bathroom?
A
Yes.
Did the FBI tell you "Everything he did
was illegal because I was under age"?

A
Yes.
Who in the FBI told you that?
A
Whichever agent I was talking to.
A
Which agent were you talking to?
I can't remember. I know I was talking to
Jason Richards, and there was a girl, I think - I
want - I want to say her name was Christina Pryor,
just off the top of my head. And then I think there
was two other agents actually at the consulate
building. I don't remember their names. Very hazy.
When was this conversation with the FBI?
A
After Sharon printed the articles, the
first articles that came out. I don't know how many
she printed, but when the first articles came out,
after that the FBI contacted me.
And was the statement that the FBI told
you "Everything he did was illegal because I was
under age," in response to you telling them that you
were age 15 when you met Jeffrey?
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection.
A
well, that was the closest proximity I had
to go off of.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay.
A
So, yes. Although I still was under age,
I mean, even if I was 16 and 17.

Okay. And then if you could do the last
page, same way; a check by anything that's not
absolutely accurate.
MS. MCCAWLEY: Okay. I'm going to object
to this as the last page has no identifier of time or
source on it.
A
Okay. I'm ready.
(BY MS. MENNINGER) All right. Which ones
are inaccurate?
The first one is, "Virginia got a
part-time job as a changing room assistant." I was a
full-time person there. Sorry.
Okay. So did you say that to Sharon?
A
Again, I don't remember that exact
conversation, but I know it was a full-time job,
and -- I mean, full-time as in the, you know, the 9
to 5 or whatever hours it was, so it wasn't
part-time. I don't remember the exact conversation
that we had.
Okay. What's the next thing you put a
check by?
A
I put a question mark next to, "Another
lady led me into Jeffrey's bedroom. The lady walked
me straight through into the massage room."
I have no idea what circumstance that

don't even know what other lady she's talking about.
So...
I
So you don't recall saying that to Sharon
Churcher?
A
Correct. I don't even know what it means.
Okay. What's the next one you have a
check by?
A
"Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills
and told to return the next day. That was the
beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein."
All right. What's wrong about that
statement?
A
Well, again, I just want to say that the
four years was inaccurate based upon memory and not
an actual timeline that we were able to get.
Did you say that to Sharon Churcher, that
it was four years?
A
I don't know if I said that to her or --
oh, yeah, did I tell her it was four years?
Yes, I
did. I'm sorry.
Okay. What else did you put a check by?
A
well, this one is a question mark again.

Did you tell that to Sharon Churcher?
No. And I think it's a mistake. Maybe
she meant somewhere else, but because we had been
talking about so much, maybe she just put New Mexico.
I don't think Sharon intentionally lied on any of
these. I just -- I think we talked so much over a
period of a week, and then after that we had phone
conversations, and so on and so forth, that some of
the information just got misheard or mishandled, or
whatever.
And what was printed was inaccurate?

• Do you recall reading any of the ones that
you put a checkmark by in the papers?
A
There's been so much printed, it's hard
for me to remember. I mean, yes, it does sound like
stuff I read before.
When you spoke with Sharon Churcher, you
agreed to waive your anonymity, right?
A
I did.
A
Why did you agree to do that?
I felt it was time for me to tell my
story. I felt it was a good time for me to come
forward. I had done so much healing, and I thought
that it would be good for other people to hear what's
going on, how it's happening, how vulnerable other
girls can be and not even know the damage that it
causes later in life. And I just thought it would be
the right thing to do to come forward.
You authorized her to publish your name?
A
I did.
And your photograph?

Yes.
In 2011?

I think that was the year, yes.

Case 18-2868, Document 286, 08/09/2019, 2628248, Page40 of 55
Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his Caribbean island for Mr.
Clinton shortly after he left office.
Jid have been about 17 at the time. I flew to the Caribbean with Jetfrey and then Chistaine
Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her.
I remember she was very excited because she got her license around the first year we met.
JIused to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the secret service with him and I remember
him talking about what a good job she did.
I don't remember seeing Bill again on the trip but I assume Ghislaine flew him back.
Virginia disclosed that Mr. Clinton's vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also
guests of Epstein on his island.
Virginia said that yet another American liberal icon, Senator George Mitchell, frequently visited
Epstein's New York residence. Mr. Mitchell, aged 77, was very close to Jeffrey, Virginia
recalled
I also met Naomi Campbell at a birthday party of hers on a yacht in the South of France. She is a
friend of Ghislaine's but she was a real bitch to me.
- Donald Trump was also a good friend of Jeffrey's. He didhit partake in any sex with any of us
but he flirted with me. He'd laugh and tell Jeffrey, 'you've got the life.'

While on the streets, I slept with men for money.

She recalls he said "I've got a good friend and I need you to fly to the island to entertain him,
massage him and make him feel how you make me feel."
The way it usually worked was I'd been sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in
the Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.
I met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell.
She was, she says, delighted when Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in

- Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant.
I told Ghislaine I wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy
gentleman who was looking for a traveling masseuse. I'd get training and be paid well.
Another lady led me into Jeffrey's bedroom. The lady walked me straight through into the

• Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to return the next day. That was the beginning
of the four years she spent with Epstein.
/ Radar Online has obtained exclusive "Diary entries" of "Teen Sex Slave".
I led Prince Andrew into the upstairs bathroom next to the room I was staying in.
I was doing my best trying to put on a good show for him by slowly undressing and started to
pour a bath.
He was caressing every part of my naked body and filling my head with endless compliments
about my blossoming figure.
He paid careful attention to my toes and was licking them.

a lot of stuff that I actually have left out of here.

So there is a lot more information I could
put in there. But as far as Ghislaine Maxwell goes,
I would like to say that there is 99.9 percent of it

Sweet, D.J.
The defendant Ghislaine Maxwell ("Maxwell" or the
"Maxwell") has moved pursuant to Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P., for
summary judgment dismissing the complaint of plaintiff
Virginia I. Giuffre ("Giuffre" or the "Giuffre") alleging
defamation. Upon the facts and conclusions set forth below, the
motion is denied.
I. Prior Proceedings
Since the filing of the complaint on September 21,
2015, setting forth Giuffre's claim of defamation by Maxwell,
this
action has been vigorously litigated, as demonstrated by
the 704 docket entries as of March 8, 2017. At issue is the
truth or falsity of a January 2015
statement issued by Maxwell.
Discovery has proceeded, a joint pretrial order has been filed,
and the action is set for
trial on May 15, 2017.
The instant motion was heard and marked fully
submitted on February 16, 2017.

Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page3 of 76
II. The Facts
The facts have been set forth in Maxwell's Memorandum
of Law in Support of Maxwell's Motion for Summary Judgment,
Southern District of New York, Local Rule 56.1; Giuffre's
Statement of Contested Facts and Giuffre's Undisputed Facts; and
Maxwell's Reply to Giuffre's Statement of Contested Facts and
Giuffre's Undisputed Facts pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1.
They are not in dispute except as noted below.
1. In early 2011, Giuffre, in two British tabloid
interviews, made numerous false and defamatory allegations
against Maxwell. In the articles, Giuffre made no direct
allegations that Maxwell was involved in any improper conduct
with Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), who had pleaded guilty in 2007
to procuring a minor for prostitution. Nonetheless, Giuffre
suggested that Maxwell worked with Epstein and may have known
about the crime for which he was convicted.
Giuffre has denied that the allegations she made
against Maxwell were
false and defamatory. She noted that she
did give an interview to journalist, Sharon Churcher
("Churcher"), in which she described Maxwell's role as someone


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page4 of 76
who recruited or facilitated the recruitment of young females
for Epstein,
that she was interviewed by the FBI in 2011, and
that
she discussed Maxwell's involvement in the sexual abuse.
2. In the articles, Giuffre alleged she had sex with
Prince Andrew, "a well-known businessman," a "world-renowned
scientist," a "respected liberal politician," and a "foreign
head of state."
Giuffre did not contest this statement but noted it
is
irrelevant.
3.
In response to the allegations, Maxwell's British
attorney, working with Ross Gow ("Gow"), Maxwell's public
relations
representative, issued a statement on March 9, 2011,
denying "the various
allegations about [Maxwell] that have
appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all
entirely false."
Giuffre has denied that Maxwell's British attorney,
Philip Barden ("Barden"), "issued a statement," noting that it
appears
to have the contact "Gow" and a reference to Devonshire
Solicitors.

The March 9, 2011 statement read in full:
Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell
By Devonshires Solicitors, PRNE Wednesday, March
9, 2011
Iondon, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies
the various allegations about her that have
appeared recently in the media. These allegations
are all entirely false.
It is unacceptable that letters sent by Maxwell's
legal representatives to certain newspapers
pointing out the truth and asking for the
allegations to be withdrawn have simply been
ignored.
In the circumstances, Maxwell is now proceeding
to take legal action
against those newspapers.
"I understand newspapers
need stories to sell
copies. It is well known that certain newspapers
live by the adage, "why let the truth get in the
way of a good story." However, the allegations
made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue
and I ask that they stop," said Ghislaine
Maxwell.
"A number of newspapers have shown a complete
lack of accuracy in their reporting of this story
and a failure to carry out the most elementary
investigation or any real due diligence. I am now
taking action to clear my name, " she said.

Giuffre has noted it is unclear if the original
included the italics
that are
inserted above.
5.
In 2008, two alleged victims of Epstein brought
action under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (the "CVRA
Action") against the United States Government purporting to
challenge Epstein's plea agreement. They alleged the Government
violated their CVRA rights by entering into the agreement.
6. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA Action on December
30, 2014, claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the
Government. On January 1, 2015, Giuffre filed a "corrected"
joinder motion. See Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 v. United States,
No. 9:08-CV-80736-KAM, Docket No. 280 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 2, 2015)
("CVRA Joinder Mot."). Giuffre's joinder motion in this
unrelated action included gratuitous and "lurid" accusations.
Giuffre has
denied the final sentence fragment.
7.
The issue presented in the joinder motion was
narrow: whether Giuffre
should be permitted to join the CVRA
6


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page7 of 76
Action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21,
specifically, whether she was a "known victim|] of Mr. Epstein
and the Government owed them CVRA duties." Jane Doe 1 and Jane
Doe 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-Cv-80736-KAM, Docket No. 324
(S.D. Fla. Apr. 7, 2015) ("CVRA Mot. Op.") at 5. Yet, "the bulk
of the [motion] consists of copious factual details that [Ms.
Giuffrel and [her co-movant] "would prove . . . if allowed to
join.'" Id. Giuffre gratuitously included provocative and "lurid
details" of her alleged sexual activities as an alleged victim
of sexual trafficking.
Giuffre has denied that the issues presented in her
joinder motion were narrow and has
noted that the issues
presented by the joinder motion and related pleadings were
multiple and complex, requiring numerous details about Giuffre's
sexual abuse
and the listing of the perpetrators of her abuse.
In a pleading explaining why the motion was filed, see Jane Doe
1 and Jane Doe 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM, Docket
No. 291 at 18-26 & n.17 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 21, 2015), Giuffre's
lawyers specifically listed nine separate reasons why Jane Doe
3's allegations that Alan Dershowitz ("Dershowitz") had sexually
abused her were relevant to the case and appropriately included
in the relevant filings. Additionally, Giuffre states that Judge
7


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page8 of 76
Marra's ruling concluded that certain allegations were not
necessary "at this juncture in the proceedings," adding that
"Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through
proper evidentiary proof, should Petitioners demonstrate a good
faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a
matter presented for the Court's consideration." CVRA Mot. Op.
at 5-6. Giuffre notes that the CVRA litigation continues and no
trial has been held as of the filing of this motion so that the
extent to which these factual details will be used at trial has
not yet been determined. See Docket Sheet, Jane Doe I and Jane
Doe 2 V. United States, No. 9:08-CV-80736-KAM.
8. At the time they filed the motion, Giuffre and
her lawyers knew that the media had been following the Epstein
criminal case and the CVRA Action. While they deliberately filed
the motion without disclosing Giuffre's name, claiming the need
for privacy and secrecy, they made no attempt to file the motion
under
seal. Quite the contrary, they filed the motion publicly.
Giuffre has noted her
denial as set forth to Statement
/ above.
8


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page9 of 76
9. As the district court noted in ruling on the
joinder motion, Giuffre "nameld] several individuals, and she
offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where
they took place. " CVRA Mot. Op. at 5. The court ruled that
"these lurid details
are unnecessary," explaining that "It]he
factual details regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged
in
sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent . . . ,
especially considering that these details involve nonparties who
are not related to the respondent Government." Id. Accordingly,
"Itlhese unnecessary details shall be stricken." Id. The court
then struck all Giuffre's factual allegations relating to her
alleged sexual activities and her allegations of misconduct by
non-parties.
Id. at 6. The court said the striking of the "lurid
details" was a sanction for Giuffre's improper inclusion of them
in the motion. Id. at 7.
Giuffre has noted her denial as set forth in Statement
7 above.
10. The district court in the CVRA Action found not
only that the "lurid details" were unnecessary but also that the
joinder motion itself
was
"entirely unnecessary." Id. at 7.
Giuffre and her lawyers
knew the motion with all its "lurid
9


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page10 of 76
details" was unnecessary because the motion itself recognized
that she would be able to participate as a fact witness to
achieve the same result she sought as a party. The court denied
Giuffre's joinder motion. Id. at 10.
Giuffre has noted her denial as set forth in Statement
7 above.
11.
One of the non-parties Giuffre "named" repeatedly
in the joinder motion was Maxwell. According to the "lurid
details" of Giuffre included in the motion, Maxwell personally
was involved in a "sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme"
created by Epstein:
• Maxwell "approached" Giuffre in 1999 when Giuffre
was "fifteen years old" to recruit her into the
scheme.
• Maxwell was "one of the main women" Epstein used
to "procure under-aged girls for sexual
activities."
• Maxwell was a "primary co-conspirator" with
Epstein in his scheme.
• She "persuaded" Giuffre to go to Epstein's
mansion "in a fashion very similar to the manner
in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators
coerced dozens of other children."
10


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page11 of 76
• At the mansion, when Giuffre began giving Epstein
a massage, he and Ms. Maxwell "turned it into a
sexual encounter."
• Epstein "with the assistance of" Maxwell
"converted [Giuffrel into . .
Id. Glutere was arese slave" From sex stave.!"
through 2002."
• Maxwell also was a "co-conspirator in Epstein's
sexual abuse."
• Maxwell "appreciated the immunity" she acquired
under Epstein's plea agreement, because the
immunity protected her from prosecution "for the
crimes she committed in Florida."
• Maxwell "participat[ed] in the sexual abuse of
[Giuffrel and others."
• Maxwell "took numerous sexually explicit pictures
of underage girls involved in sexual activities,
including [Giuffrel." Id. She shared the photos
with Epstein.
• As part of her "role in Epstein's sexual abuse
ring," Maxwell "connect[ed]" Epstein with
"powerful individuals" so that Epstein could
traffic Giuffre to these persons.
• Giuffre was "forced to have sexual relations"
with Prince Andrew in "[Maxwell's] apartment" in
London. Maxwell "facilitated" Giuffre's sex with
Prince Andrew "by acting as a 'madame' for
Epstein."
• Maxwell "assist[ed] in internationally
trafficking" Giuffre and "numerous other young
girls for sexual purposes."
• Giuffre was "forced" to watch Epstein, Maxwell
and others "engage in illegal sexual acts with
dozens of underage girls."
See CVRA Joinder Mot.

12.
In the joinder motion, Giuffre also alleged she
was "forced" to have sex with Dershowitz, "model scout" Jean Luc
Brunel, and "many other powerful men, including numerous
prominent American politicians, powerful business executives,
foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world
leaders." CVRA Joinder Mot. at 5-6.
Giuffre has noted her denial as set forth in
Statements 7 and 11 above.
14

13.
Giuffre said after serving for four years as a
"sex
slave," she "managed to escape to a foreign country and
hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years." Id. at
3.
Giuffre has admitted making this statement and has
noted since discovered
evidence that indicates she was mistaken
on the exact timeframe of her abuse and was with Maxwell and
Epstein from the years 2000-2002.
14. Giuffre suggested the Government was part of
Epstein's "conspiracy" when it "secretly" negotiated a non-
prosecution agreement ("NPA") with Epstein precluding federal
prosecution of Epstein and his "co-conspirators." Id. at 6. The
Government's secrecy, Giuffre alleged, was motivated by its fear
that Giuffre would raise "powerful objections" to the agreement
that would have "shed tremendous public light" on Epstein and
other powerful individuals. Id. at 6-7.
Giuffre has denied that she suggested that the
Government was part of Epstein's conspiracy to commit sex
offenses and has noted that the CVRA Action deals with whether
the Government failed
in their responsibilities to the victims
15


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page16 of 76
to inform the victims that the Government was working out an
NPA, that the Government did fail to so inform the victims, and
that it intentionally did not inform the victims because the
expected serious objection from many of the victims might
prevent the Government from finalizing the NPA with Epstein.
15. The other "Jane Doe" who joined Giuffre's motion
who alleged she was sexually abused on "many occasions" by
Epstein was unable to corroborate any of Giuffre's allegations.
Giuffre has denied the statement and noted that the
other Jane Doe could corroborate many of Giuffre's allegations
based on a similar pattern of abuse by Epstein that she
suffered, that she did not know Giuffre, and further has noted
who was deposed in this case, and who was a
minor, corroborates the same pattern of abuse.
16. In her multiple and lengthy consensual interviews
with Churcher three years earlier, Giuffre told Churcher of
virtually none of the details she described in the joinder
motion.
16


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page17 of 76
Giuffre has denied the statement and noted that
absence of any citation or evidence on this point and that the
statement here is knowingly false based on the articles and
Giuffre's deposition.
17. As Giuffre and her lawyers expected, before Judge
Marra in the CVRA Action could strike the "lurid details" of
Giuffre's
allegations in the joinder motion, members of the
media obtained copies of the motion.
Giuffre has denied the statement as set forth in
Statement 7 above.
18. At the direction of Barden, on January 2, 2015,
Gow sent to numerous representatives of British media
organizations an email containing "a quotable statement on
behalf of Maxwell" (the "Press
Release"). The email was sent to
more than six and probably fewer than 30 media representatives.
It was not sent to non-media representatives.
Giuffre has denied that "[alt Mr. Barden's direction,
on January [21, 2015, Gow sent to numerous representatives of
British media organizations an email containing 'a quotable
17


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page18 of 76
statement on behalf of Maxwell'" and has noted that Gow produced
an email exchange he had with Maxwell in which Maxwell directs
Gow
to send the Press Release as follows:
From: G Maxwell <GMax1@ellmax.coms
Date: Fri, 2 Jan 2015 20:14:53 +0000
To: Ross Gowcross/@acuityreputation.com>
Ce: Philip Bardencphilip.barden@devonshires.co.ukx
Subject: FW: URGENT - this is the statement
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts so not a new individual.
The allegations made by Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.
The original allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to
be untrue
Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschwitz is
involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies
Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised
as news, as they are defamatory.
Giuffre has further noted that chronologically, this
email comes at the end of various other email exchanges between
Maxwell and Gow that discuss issuing a press release and that
the subject line of this email that Maxwell wrote to Gow states
"URGENT - this is the statement," thereby instructing Gow to
release this statement to the press. Additionally, Giuffre notes
that shortly after Maxwell sent this email to Gow directing him
to release the Press Release, Gow distributed it to multiple
media outlets,
and that no email has been produced in which
18


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page19 of 76
Barden directed Gow to issue this press release. At his
deposition, Gow authenticated this email and confirmed that
Maxwell authorized the statement.
Giuffre has noted that the email and Gow's testimony
establish that Maxwell, not Barden, directed and "command led]"
•Gow to publish the defamatory statement and the first sentence
of the statement is false and the second sentence - "This email
was sent to more than 6 and probably less than 30 media
representatives" - omits the fact that not only did Gow admit to
emailing the statement to the press, but he also read it to over
30 media representatives over the phone. Giuffre has denied the
statement.
19. Among the media representatives who received the
Press Release were Martin Robinson of the Daily Mail, P. Peachey
of The Independent, Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror, David Brown of
The Times, Nick Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC, and David
Mercer of the Press Association. These representatives were
selected based on their request after the joinder motion was
filed-for a response from Maxwell to Giuffre's allegations in
the motion.
19


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page20 of 76
Giuffre has denied the second sentence and has noted
there is no record evidence that Gow lor anyone else) "selected"
journalists "for a response," or that there was any selection
process and that Gow testified that anyone who inquired received
a reference to the Press Release.
20. The email to the media members read:
To Whom It May Concern,
Please
find attached a quotable statement on behalf of
Maxwell.
No further communication will be provided by her on
this matter.
Thanks for your understanding.

21. Barden, who prepared the Press Release, did not
intend it as a traditional press release solely to disseminate
information to the media, and he intentionally did not pass it
through a public relations firm, such as Gow's firm, Acuity
Reputation.
22


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page23 of 76
Giuffre has denied the statement and has noted that
the Barden Declaration should not be considered. She has further
noted that there is no evidence to support any assertion of
Barden's intent and that Maxwell gave the statement to Gow with
instructions to publish it. Giuffre also has denied that the
statement did not pass "through a public relations firm, such as
Gow's firm, Acuity Reputation" and has noted that record
documentary evidence and testimony establish that this statement
was disseminated through Gow's firm, Acuity Reputation.
22. The Press Release served two purposes. First,
Barden intended that it mitigate the
harm to Maxwell's
reputation from the press's republication of Giuffre's false
allegations. He believed these ends could be accomplished by
suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should
subject Giuffre's allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. For
example, he noted in the statement that Giuffre's allegations
changed dramatically over time,
suggesting that they are
"obvious lies" and therefore should not be "publicized as news."
Giuffre has denied this statement and any statement of
Barden's intent and that there was any "republication" by the
23


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page24 of 76
press as a matter of law as the press did not "republish" the
press statement under New York law and that the allegations in
the statement are "false," and cites to the evidence set forth
in Statement 11 above.
Giuffre has further disputed that the harm to
Maxwell's reputation could be mitigated by the media's inquiry
into and scrutiny of Giuffre's allegations, because a deeper
inquiry would only reveal additional evidence corroborating
Giuffre's allegations,
and has noted that the record does not
establish who drafted the Press Release, and that it was
ultimately Maxwell
who "noted" anything because it is her
statement and that she directed that it be sent to the media and
public.
Giuffre has also disputed that her allegations have
changed over time, "dramatically" or otherwise, that the Press
Release "suggest[ed]" that her allegations are "obvious
lies,"
because the Press Release affirmatively stated that her
allegations are "obvious lies" there is no subtlety, suggestion,
or statement of opinion here.
24


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page25 of 76
23. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be
"a shot across the bow" of the media, which he believed had been
unduly eager to publish Giuffre's allegations without conducting
any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement he
repeatedly noted that Giuffre's allegations were "defamatory."
In this
sense, the statement was intended as a cease and desist
letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients
understand the seriousness with which Maxwell considered the
publication of Giuffre's obviously false allegations and the
legal indefensibility of their own conduct.
Giuffre has denied this statement and the statement
that Barden repeatedly noted that Giuffre's allegations were
"defamatory" as he did not "note" anything in the statement, nor
does Maxwell cite to any record evidence that he did.
Giuffre further denies the sentence, "In this sense,
the statement was intended as a cease and desist letter to the
media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the
seriousness with which Maxwell considered the publication of
Giuffre's obviously false allegations and the legal
indefensibility of their own conduct," as there is no record
25


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page26 of 76
evidence in support of this claim, and Maxwell has not cited
any.
24. Consistent with his purposes as described by
Maxwell, Gow's emails prefaced the statement with the following
language: "Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf
of Maxwell." The statement was intended to be a single, one-time
only, comprehensive response, quoted in full, to Giuffre's
December 30, 2014, allegations that would give the media
Maxwell's response. The purpose of
the prefatory statement was
to inform the media-recipients of this
intent.
Giuffre has disputed the statement and any statement
relating to Barden's "purposes,"
as explained above, and has
noted that Gow
repeatedly issued this statement via email and
over the phone for months on end and that Maxwell instructed
them to publish it by telling them it was "quotable, "
and hired a press agent to distribute it to the press with the
intent for the press to publish the Press
Release.
25.
Giuffre has engaged in numerous activities to
bring attention to herself, to the prosecution and punishment of
26


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page27 of 76
wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest
of bringing light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
Giuffre has denied that she engaged in activities to
bring attention to herself but has noted that she has taken
action to aid in the prosecution of her abusers, and she seeks
to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse.
26.
Giuffre created an organization, Victims Refuse
Silence, Inc., a Florida corporation, directly related to her
alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse.
27. The "goal" of Victims Refuse Silence "was, and
continues to be, to help survivors surmount the shame, silence,
and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual
abuse." Toward this end, Giuffre has "dedicated her professional
life to helping victims of sex trafficking."
28. Giuffre repeatedly has sought out media
organizations to discuss her alleged experience as a victim of
sexual abuse.
27


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page28 of 76
Giuffre has denied the statement and noted that she
was approached by numerous media outlets and refused to speak to
most of them, that media organizations sought her out and she
did not seek them out.
29. Giuffre has written the manuscript of a book she
has been trying to publish detailing her alleged experience as a
victim of sexual abuse and of sex trafficking in Epstein's
alleged "sex scheme."
Giuffre has stated that this mischaracterizes these
activities, that it was against a backdrop of seeking
psychological counseling that she drafted the manuscript as an
"act of empowerment" and "a way of reframing and taking control
over the narrative." Pl.'s Opp'n at 60. Giuffre notes that she
ultimately decided not to publish the manuscript. See Giuffre
Dep. Tr. 249:16-18; 250:19-251:3.
30.
Giuffre was required by Interrogatory No. 6 to
identify any false statements attributed to Maxwell that were
"published globally, including within the Southern District of
New York," as Giuffre alleged in Paragraph 9 of Count One of her
complaint. In response, Giuffre identified the Press Release and
28


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page 29 of 76
nine instances in which various
news media published portions of
the Press Release in news articles or broadcast stories.
Giuffre has denied this statement. There is no
"republication" as a matter of law and Maxwell possesses the
knowledge as to where the defamatory
statements were published
and Giuffre has noted that she has provided a sampling of
Maxwell's defamatory statements published by the news media and
that Maxwell caused her statement to be published in an enormous
number of media outlets.

31. In none of the nine instances was there any
publication of the entire Press
Release.
Giuffre has noted extensive evidence of the mass
distribution of Maxwell's defamatory statement to over 66
million viewers as stated by her expert witness James Jansen
("Jansen") .
32. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or
authority over any media organization, including the media
identified in Giuffre's
response to Interrogatory No. 6, in
connection with the media's publication of portions of the Press
Release
Giuffre has disputed this statement and noted it is
completely devoid of record evidence and that the record
establishes that Maxwell hired Gow because his position allowed
him to influence the press to publish her defamatory statement,
Dep. Ir. at 13:9-16; 15:18-16:3; 109:12-22; 110:16-21; 111:3-7,
and that Maxwell caused her statement to be published by
numerous major news organizations with wide readership all over
the globe.
31


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page32 of 76
33.
Eight years after Epstein's guilty plea in
Florida, Giuffre brought this action, repeating many of the
allegations she made in her CVRA joinder motion.
Giuffre has noted that the defamation cause of action
against Maxwell did not accrue until Maxwell defamed her in
January of 2015.
34.
The complaint alleged that the January 2015
statement "contained the following deliberate falsehoods":
(a)
That Giuffre's sworn allegations "against
Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue."
(b)
That the allegations have been "shown to be
untrue."
(c)
That Giuffre's "claims are obvious lies."
35.
Giuffre lived independently from her parents with
her fiancé long before meeting Epstein or Maxwell. After leaving
the Growing Iogether drug rehabilitation facility in 1999,
Giuffre moved in with
the family of a fellow patient. There she
32


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page33 of 76
met, and became engaged to, her friend's brother, James Michael
Austrich ("Austrich"). She and Austrich thereafter rented an
apartment in the Ft. Lauderdale area with another friend and
both worked at various jobs in that area. Later, they stayed
briefly with Giuffre's parents in the Palm Beach/Loxahatchee,
Florida area before Austrich rented an apartment for the couple
on Bent Oak Drive in Royal Palm Beach. Although Giuffre agreed
to marry Austrich, she never had any intention of doing so.
Giuffre has denied that she voluntarily lived
independently from her parents with her fiancé; she states that
she was
a troubled minor child who was not realistically engaged
prior to meeting Maxwell and Epstein, as she was not of legal
age to marry. She confirms she had no intention of marrying
Austrich.
36. Giuffre re-enrolled in high school from June 21,
2000 until March 7, 2002. After finishing the 9th grade school
year at
Forest Hills High School on June 9, 1999, Giuffre re-
enrolled at Wellington Adult High School on June 21, 2000, again
on August 16, 2000 and on August 14, 2001. On September 20,
2001, Giuffre then enrolled at Royal Palm Beach High School. A
few
weeks later, on October 12, 2001, she matriculated at
33


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page34 of 76
Survivors Charter School. Survivor's Charter School was an
alternative school designed to assist students who had been
unsuccessful at more traditional schools. Giuffre remained
enrolled at Survivor's Charter School until March 7, 2002. She
was present 56 days and absent 13 days during her time there.
Giuffre never received her high school diploma or GED. The
school day at Survivor's Charter School lasted from morning
until early afternoon.
Giuffre has denied the statement and has noted that
Giuffre's school transcripts indicate "NO COURSES TAKEN" for the
1999-2000 and 2000-2001 school years and that her attempt to
work and resume school at Survivor's Charter School as a 10th
grader in the 2001-2002 school year was limited to a portion of
the school year, spanning fewer than six months from October
2001 to March 7, 2002. She states that she attempted to get away
from Epstein's abuse and that the records indicate that
Giuffre's attendance was poor, with 69 days present and 32 days
absent out of a required 180 day school year. She was not
enrolled at the end of the school year. Her presence on flights
with Epstein, verified by Epstein's pilot on flight logs, and an
abundance of witness testimony corroborate her story that she
was flying domestic and internationally with Epstein at least 32
34


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page35 of 76
times between December 11, 2000 to July 28, 2001 and June 21,
2002 to August 21, 2002.
37. During the year 2000, Giuffre worked numerous
jobs. In 2000, while living with her fiancé, Giuffre held five
different jobs: at Aviculture Breeding and Research Center,
Southeast Employee Management Company, The Club at Mar-a-Lago,
Oasis Outsourcing, and Neiman Marcus. Her taxable earnings that
year totaled nearly $9,000. Giuffre cannot now recall either the
Southeast Employee Management Company or the Oasis Outsourcing
jobs.
Giuffre has disputed the statement and has noted that
while she held various jobs in 2000, Social Security
Administration records do not show the exact dates of employment
(month and day) because they do not need this information to
figure Social Security benefits. She states that neither
Southeast Employee Management Company nor Oasis Outsourcing were
her employers. She states that she worked at Taco Bell, as well
a pet store, but that neither of these are listed on her
Social Security Administration records because they were most
likely paid through payroll companies. She subsequently worked
at Mar-a-Lago. She also volunteered at Aviculture Breeding and
35


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page36 of 76
Research Center, where they eventually put her on the payroll
but paid her very little.
38.
Giuffre's employment at The Mar-a-Lago spa began
in fall 2000. Giuffre's father, Sky Roberts ("Roberts"), was
hired as a maintenance worker at The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm
Beach, Florida, beginning on April 11, 2000. Roberts worked
there year-round for approximately 3 years. After working there
for a period of time, Roberts became acquainted with the head of
the spa area and
recommended Giuffre for a job there. Mar-a-Lago
closes every Mother's Day and reopens on November 1. Most
employees at Mar-a-Lago, including all employees of the spa area
such as "spa attendants," are "seasonal" and work only when the
club is open, i.e., between November 1 and Mother's Day. Giuffre
was hired as a "seasonal" spa attendant to work at the Mar-a-
Lago Club in the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17.
Giuffre has disputed the statement and noted that the
Mar-a-Lago Club produced 177 pages of records in response to
Maxwell's subpoena which did not indicate Giuffre's actual dates
of employment, nor whether she was a full-time or seasonal
employee. The only significant record produced was a single,
36


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page37 of 76
vague chart entry indicating that Giuffre was terminated in 2000
and that Mar-a-Lago was a summer job.
39. Giuffre represented herself as a masseuse for
Epstein. While working at the Mar-a-Lago spa and reading a
library book about massage, Giuffre met Maxwell. Giuffre
thereafter told her father that she got a job working for
Epstein as a masseuse. Giuffre's father took her to Epstein's
house on one occasion around that time, and Epstein came outside
and introduced himself to Roberts. Giuffre commenced employment
as a traveling masseuse for Epstein. Giuffre was excited about
her job as a masseuse, about traveling with him and about
meeting famous people. Giuffre represented that she was employed
as a masseuse beginning in January 2001. Giuffre never mentioned
Maxwel1 to Austrich. Giuffre's father never met Maxwell.
Giuffre has denied the statement and has noted that in
Florida, a person cannot work as a masseuse unless she is "at
least 18 years of age or has received a high
school diploma or
high school equivalency diploma," Fla. Stat. § 480.041. She was
a minor child, under the age of 18, when she was working at Mar-
a-Lago as a spa attendant and was approached by Maxwell who told
her she could make money as a masseuse, a profession in which
37


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page38 of 76
Giuffre had no experience. She states that her father drove her
to Epstein's house, the address of which was given to her by
Maxwell, that she was led into the house and instructed by
Maxwell on how to give a massage. She states that Epstein and
Maxwell turned the massage into a sexual encounter, and offered
her money and a better life to be compliant in the sexual
demands of Maxwell and Epstein. She then began travelling with
Maxwell and Epstein on private planes and servicing people
sexually for money - working not as a legitimate masseuse, but
in a position of sexual servitude. Giuffre further noted that
Epstein's house manager, Alessi, described Maxwell's methodical
routine of how
she prepared a list of places ahead of time, then
drove to each place for the purpose of recruiting girls to
massage Epstein. Alessi
stated that on multiple occasions he
drove Maxwell to pre-planned places while she recruited girls
for massage, and that he witnessed Giuffre at Epstein's house on
the very same day that he witnessed Maxwell recruit Giuffre from
Mar-a-Lago.
Giuffre further noted Sjoberg's testimony that she
was similarly recruited.
40. In spring 2001, while living with Austrich,
Giuffre lied to and cheated on him with Figueroa, her high
school boyfriend. Giuffre and Austrich thereafter broke up, and
38


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page39 of 76
Figueroa moved into the Bent Oak apartment with Giuffre. When
Austrich returned to the Bent Oak apartment to check on his pets
and retrieve his belongings, Figueroa punched Austrich in the
face. Figueroa and Giuffre fled the scene before police arrived.
Figueroa was then a convicted felon and a drug abuser on
probation for possession of a controlled substance.
Giuffre has objected to the statement as irrelevant
and unrelated to the allegations made in Giuffre's complaint
against Maxwell and the alleged information should be excluded
by multiple rules of evidence, and has been contested by
Giuffre.
41. Giuffre freely and voluntarily contacted the
police to come to her aid in 2001 and 2002 but never reported to
them that she was Epstein's "sex slave." In August 2001 at age
17, while living in the same apartment, Giuffre and Figueroa
hosted a party with a number of guests. During the party,
according to Giuffre, someone entered Giuffre's room and stole
$500 from her shirt pocket. Giuffre contacted the police. she
met and spoke with police officers regarding the incident and
filed a report. She did not disclose to the officer that she was
a "sex slave." A second time, in June 2002, Giuffre contacted
39


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page40 of 76
the police to report that her former landlord had left her
belongings by the roadside and had lit her mattress on fire.
Again, Giuffre met and spoke with the law enforcement officers
but did not complain that she was the victim of any sexual
trafficking or abuse or that she was then being held as a "sex
slave."
Giuffre has objected to the statement as misleading
and irrelevant and further noted that she was fearful of Maxwell
and Epstein, and, accordingly, she would not have reported her
abusers and noted that she knew that Epstein had control over
the Palm Beach Police.
42. From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein
and Maxwell were almost entirely absent from Florida on
documented travel unaccompanied by Giuffre. Flight logs
maintained by Dave Rodgers ("Rodgers"), Epstein's private pilot,
evidence the substantial number of trips away from Florida that
Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Giuffre, between
August 2001 and September 2002. Rodgers maintained a log of all
flights on which Epstein and Maxwell traveled with him. Epstein
additionally traveled with another pilot who did not keep such
logs and he also occasionally traveled via commercial flights.
40


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page41 of 76
For substantially all of thirteen months of the twenty-two month
period from November 2000 to September 2002, Epstein was
traveling outside of Florida unaccompanied by Giuffre. During
this same period of time, Giuffre was employed at various jobs,
enrolled in school, and living with her boyfriend.
Giuffre has disputed this statement and noted the
flight logs produced in this matter provide substantive evidence
of Giuffre's travel while in the control of Maxwell and Epstein,
but are incomplete as Giuffre also was flown by Maxwell on
commercial flights. The flight logs and pilot testimony clearly
prove that Giuffre was flying domestic and internationally with
Epstein at least 32 times between December 11, 2000 to July 28,
2001 and June 21, 2002 to August 21, 2002. Maxwell has
acknowledged the flight logs are incomplete and that there were
several pilots and co-pilots that flew Epstein and Maxwell
(e.g., Rodgers, Lawrence "Larry" Visoski, Bill Hammond, Pete
Rathgeb, Gary Roxburgh, and Bill Murphy) in multiple aircrafts
and that only Rodgers produced flight records. Giuffre states
that Maxwell has also acknowledged that many of the girls
recruited by Maxwell routinely traveled on commercial flights
for the purposes of providing massages to Epstein or guests at
Epstein's New York, New Mexico, or U.S. Virgin Island homes.
41


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page42 of 76
Giuffre has further noted that her passport
application, travel records, and witness testimony demonstrate
flight logs are incomplete, that she also flew commercially
while she worked for Maxwell and Epstein. Her passport
application, for example, listed travel plans to London, and
subsequent flight logs listed Giuffre traveling to London with
Maxwell, Epstein, and others. Giuffre has cited the evidence she
contends establish her travel with Epstein and Maxwell,
including massage training in Thailand.
43.
Giuffre and Figueroa shared a '93 white Pontiac
in 2001 and 2002. Giuffre freely traveled around the Palm Beach
area in that vehicle. In August 2002, Giuffre acquired a Dodge
Dakota pickup truck from her father. Figueroa used that vehicle
in a series of crimes before and after Giuffre left for
Thailand.
Giuffre has denied the statement and has noted that
she purchased a car from the $10, 000 payment she received from
Epstein after she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew in
London at Maxwell's home.
42


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page 43 of 76
44. Giuffre held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002.
During 2001 and 2002, Giuffre was gainfully employed at several
jobs. She worked as a waitress at Mannino's Restaurant, at
IGIFriday's restaurant ("CCI Of Royal Palm Inc."), and at
Roadhouse Grill. She also was employed at Courtyard Animal
Hospital ("Marc Pinkwasser DVM").
Giuffre has denied the statement and noted that in
2001 and 2002 she attempted to go back to school to earn her
GED, and tried unsuccessfully to hold down waitressing jobs. She
earned $212.00 as a waitress working "briefly" at Mannino's
Restaurant and, in 2002, earned $403.64 working at the
TGIFriday's restaurant ("CCI of Royal Palm Beach") for a "short
time period." She earned about $1,247.90 at Roadhouse Grill
until about March 2002, and at the Courtyard Animal Hospital
("Marc Pinkwasser DVM") she received payroll checks for weeks
ending April 22, 2002 to June 4, 2002, earning a total of
$1,561.75. Not long after she lost her job at the Courtyard
Animal Hospital, she was traveling with Maxwell to the Bahamas,
Santa Fe, New Mexico, and New York.
45. Giuffre traveled to Thailand in September 2002 to
receive formal training as a masseuse. Figueroa drove her to the
43


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page44 of 76
airport. While there, she initially contacted Figueroa
frequently, incurring a phone bill of $4,000. She then met
Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and decided to marry him. She
thereafter ceased all contact with Figueroa from October 2002
until two days before Figueroa's deposition in this matter in
May 2016.
Giuffre admitted traveling to Thailand to receive
massage training in September 2002 but noted that she was given
assignment from Maxwell and Epstein that she had to recruit
another underage girl from Thailand, and bring that young girl
back to Epstein. Giuffre stated that she was expected to return
to Epstein and Maxwell upon completion of her massage training
and assignment, and that instead
she escaped to Australia where
she remained in hiding from Maxwell and Epstein for several
years.
46. Detective Joseph Recarey ("Recarey") investigated
Epstein and failed to uncover any evidence that Maxwell was
involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or
production or possession of child pornography. Recarey served as
the lead detective from the Palm Beach Police Department charged
with investigating Epstein. That investigation commenced in
44


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page45 of 76
2005. Recarey worked only on the Epstein case for an entire
year. He reviewed previous officers' reports and interviews,
conducted numerous interviews of witnesses and alleged victims
himself,
reviewed surveillance footage of the Epstein home,
participated in and had knowledge of the search warrant executed
on the Epstein home,
and testified regarding the case before
the
Florida state grand jury against Epstein.
Recarey's investigation revealed that not one of the
alleged Epstein victims ever mentioned Maxwell's name and she
was never considered a suspect by the Government. None of
Epstein's alleged victims said they had seen Maxwell at
Epstein's house, nor said they had been "recruited by her, " nor
paid any money by her,
nor told what to wear or how to act by
her. Indeed, none of Epstein's alleged victims ever reported to
the Government they had met or spoken to Maxwell. Maxwell was
not seen coming or going from the house during the law
enforcement surveillance of Epstein's home. The arrest warrant
did not mention Maxwell and her name was never mentioned before
the grand jury. No property belonging to Maxwell, including "sex
toys" or "child pornography," was seized from Epstein's home
during execution of the search warrant. Recarey, when asked to
describe "everything that you believe you know about Ghislaine
45


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page46 of 76
Maxwell's sexual trafficking conduct," replied, "I don't." He
confirmed he has no knowledge about Maxwell sexually trafficking
anybody. Recarey also has no knowledge of Giuffre's conduct that
is
subject of this lawsuit.
Giuffre has denied the statement and noted that
Recarey wanted to speak to Maxwell, but she did not return his
calls and he concluded that Maxwell's role was to procure girls
for Epstein. Giuffre further noted that in the execution of the
search warrant, stationary was found in the home bearing
Maxwell's name, and notes
were written by house staff to Maxwell
and message pads uncovered in trash pulls revealing numerous
calls left at the house for Maxwell, indicating she was staying
in the house during the days when Epstein was engaging in
illegal sex acts with minors. Giuffre further noted that a walk
through video taken during the execution of the search warrant
revealed photos of topless females at the home, including a
photograph of Maxwell naked hanging in the home. Alfredo
Rodriguez ("Rodriguez"), the house butler from 2004 through
2005, a time period that included daily sexual abuse of underage
females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls
who were giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude
photos of girls on her computer. Giuffre states that Recarey
46


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page47 of 76
testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house
had been sanitized and the computers removed from the home.
Giuffre states that the co-conspirator who maintained
direct contact with the many underage victims was Kellen, whose
sole responsibility was to schedule underage girls to visit
Epstein for sex and reported directly to Maxwell. Figueroa
testified that Maxwell personally requested that he find and
bring girls to Epstein for sex once Giuffre had escaped, and
that when he brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them,
that Maxwell was "the boss" and that she knew everything that
was going on.
47. No nude photograph of Giuffre was displayed in
Epstein's home. Epstein's housekeeper, Alessi, "never
saw
any
photographs of Virginia Roberts [Giuffrel in Epstein's house."
Recarey entered Epstein's home in 2002 to install security
cameras
to catch a thief and did not observe any "child
pornography" within the home, including on Epstein's desk in his
office.
Giuffre has
denied this statement and noted that
Maxwell had pornography on her computer, that there was a
47


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page 48 of 76|
collage of nude photos in Epstein's closet, that the collage was
taken into evidence by Recarey, who
testified to that fact in
his deposition, that Rizzo, a visitor to the home on numerous
occasions, was reprimanded by Maxwell for looking at the nude
photos, and
that the search warrant revealed photographs of
nudity displayed, including a photograph of Maxwell herself in
the nude. Sjorberg
testified that Maxwell bought her a camera
for the specific purpose of her taking nude photos of herself
and Giuffre has testified that there was a nude photograph of
her at the house.
48. Giuffre drafted a "journal" describing
individuals to whom she claims she was sexually trafficked as
well as her memories and thoughts about her experiences with
Epstein. In 2013, she and her husband created a bonfire in her
backyard in Florida and burned the journal together with other
documents in her possession. Giuffre also kept a "dream journal"
regarding her thoughts and memories that she possessed in
January 2016. To date, Giuffre cannot locate the
"dream
journal."
49.
Giuffre publicly peddled her story beginning in
2011. Giuffre granted journalist Churcher extensive interviews
48


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page 49 of 76
that resulted in seven widely distributed articles from March
2011 through January 2015. Churcher regularly communicated with
Giuffre and her "attorneys or other agents" from "early 2011" to
"the present day." Giuffre received approximately $160, 000 for
her stories and pictures that were published by many news
organizations.
Giuffre has denied this statement in part and admitted
it in part, noting that in 2011, Giuffre was still in hiding
from Epstein and Maxwell in Australia and not looking to sell
anything or even speak with anyone about what had happened to
her. Churcher located Giuffre
and impressed the importance of
Giuffre standing up to those who had harmed her and speaking
with
• federal authorities. Giuffre did so in 2011, bringing the
abuse of Maxwell and Epstein to public light to prevent their
continued abuse of others. Giuffre agreed to be interviewed by
Churcher and was compensated for sharing her story, which came
at the heavy price of being publicly scrutinized.
50. Giuffre drafted a 144-page purportedly
autobiographical book manuscript in 2011 which she actively
sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous with her Churcher
interviews, Giuffre drafted a book manuscript which purported to
49


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page50 of 76
document Giuffre's experiences as a teenager in Florida,
including her interactions with Epstein and Maxwell. Giuffre
communicated with literary agents, ghost writers, and potential
independent publishers in an effort to get her book published.
She generated marketing materials and circulated those along
with book chapters to numerous individuals associated with
publishing and the media.
Giuffre has denied the statement in part and admitted
it in part, stating that she received a Victim Notification
Letter from the United States Attorney's office for the Southern
District of Florida regarding her sexual victimization by
Epstein, that in 2011 she sought psychological counseling from a
psychologist for the trauma she endured, and that also that year
Churcher sought her out and interviewed her. Giuffre was
interviewed by the FBI in 2011. Giuffre has noted that she began
to draft a fictionalized account of what happened to her as an
act of empowerment and a way of reframing and taking control
over the narrative of her past abuse that haunts her and, while
she explored trying to publish her story to empower other
individuals who were subject to abuse, she ultimately decided
not to publish it.
50


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page51 of 76
51. The CVRA joinder motion filed by Giuffre
generated a media maelstrom and spawned highly publicized
litigation between Giuffre's lawyers - Bradley Edwards
("Edwards") and Paul Cassell ("Cassell") - and Dershowitz. After
Giuffre publicly accused Dershowitz of sexual misconduct,
Dershowitz vigorously defended himself in the media. He called
Giuffre a liar and accused her lawyers of unethical conduct. In
response, Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz, who
counterclaimed. This litigation, in turn, caused additional
media attention by national and international media
organization.
Giuffre has denied the statement as set forth in
Statement 7.
52. Giuffre formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence
to attract publicity and speak out on a public controversy. In
2014, Giuffre, with the assistance of the same counsel, formed a
non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to
Giuffre, the purpose of the organization
is to promote Giuffre's
professed cause against sex slavery. The stated goal of her
organization is to help survivors surmount the shame,
silence,
and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual
51


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page52 of 76
abuse. Giuffre attempts to promote Victims Refuse Silence at
every opportunity. For example, Giuffre participated in an
interview in New York with ABC to promote the charity and to get
her mission out to the public.
Giuffre has denied that she formed the non-profit
Victims Refuse Silence to "speak out on a public controversy, "
and noted she sought to help survivors of sexual abuse and
sexual trafficking and in order to provide assistance to
victims, she attempted to talk about the non-profit's mission
when
she had the opportunity to do so.
III.
The Applicable Standard
Summary judgment is appropriate only where "there is
no genuine issue
as to any material fact and . . . the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R.
Civ. P. 56(c). "[T]he substantive law will identify which facts
are material." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,
248(1986).
A dispute is "genuine" if "the evidence is such that a
reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party."
52


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page53 of 76
Id. The relevant inquiry on application for summary judgment is
"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to
require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that
one party must prevail as a matter of law." Id. at 251-52. A
court is not charged with weighing the evidence and determining
its truth, but with determining whether there is a genuine issue
for trial. Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. N.Y. City Transit Auth.,
735 F. Supp. 1205, 1212 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (quoting Anderson, 477
U.S. at 249). "[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual
dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise
properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement
is that there be no genuine issue of material fact." Anderson,
477 U.S. at 247-48 (emphasis in original).
While the moving party bears the initial burden of
showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists, Atl. Mut.
Ins. Co. v. CSX Lines, I.I.C., 432 F.3d 428, 433 (2d Cir. 2005),
in cases where the non-moving party bears the burden of
persuasion at trial, "the burden on the moving party may be
discharged by 'showing'-that
is, pointing out to the district
court-that there is an absence of evidence to support the
nonmoving party's case." Celotex Corp. V. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
325 (1986). "It is ordinarily sufficient for the movant to point
53


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page54 of 76
to a lack of evidence . . . on an essential element of the non-
movant's claim . . . . [T]he nonmoving party must [then| come
forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine
issue of fact for trial
...." Jaramillo v. Weyerhaeuser Co.,
536 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal citations omitted);
see also Goenaga v. March of Dimes Birth Defects Found., 51 F.3d
14, 18 (2d Cir. 1995) ('Once the moving party has made a
properly supported showing sufficient to suggest the absence of
any genuine issue as to a material fact, the nonmoving party ...
must come forward with evidence that would be sufficient to
support a jury verdict in his favor").
IV.
The Motion for Summary Judgment on Republication Grounds is
Denied
Maxwell has moved for summary judgment dismissing
Giuffre's complaint on the grounds that Maxwell is not liable
for the republication of her Press Release by the media. Because
as a matter of law the issuer of a press release is responsible
for its publication, the motion is denied.
In New York, liability for a republication "must be
based on real authority to influence the final product." Davis
54


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page55 of 76
v. Costa-Gavras, 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1096 (S.D.N.Y. 1984); see
also Hoffman v. Landers, 146 A.D.2d 744, 747 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d
Dep't 1989) ("One who makes a defamatory statement is not
responsible for its recommunication without his authority or
request by another over whom he has no control."). Where a
defendant "had no actual part in composing or publishing," he
cannot be held liable "without disregarding the settled rule of
law that no man is bound for the tortious act of another over
whom he has
not a master's power of control." Davis, 580 F.
Supp. at 1096 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
The New York Court of Appeals summarized New York's
republication liability standard in Geraci v. Probst, 938 N.E.2d
917 (N.Y. 2010), stating that
one who ... prints and publishes a libelll is
not responsible for its voluntary and
unjustifiable repetition, without his authority
or request, by others over whom he has no control
and who thereby make themselves liable to the
person injured, and that such repetition cannot
be considered in law a necessary, natural and
probable consequence of the original slander or
938 N.E.2d at 921 (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). Thus, "conclusive evidence of lack of actual authority
lis] sufficiently dispositive that the [court] 'ha[s] no option
but to dismiss the case
....'" Davis, 580 F. Supp. at 1096
55


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page56 of 76
(quoting Rinaldi v. Viking Penguin, Inc., 420 N.E.2d 377, 382
(N. Y
. 1981)).
However, New York law assigns liability to individuals
for the media's publication of press releases. New York
appellate courts have held that an individual is liable for the
media publishing that individual's defamatory press release. See
Levy v. Smith, 132 A.D.3d 961, 962-63 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep't
2015) ("Generally, [olne who makes a defamatory statement is not
responsible for its recommunication without his authority or
request by another over whom he has no control . ... Here,
however, ... the appellant intended and authorized the
republication of the allegedly defamatory content of the press
releases in the news articles."); see also RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF
TORTS $ 576 (1977) ("The publication of a libel or slander is a
legal cause of any special harm resulting from its repetition by
a third person if ... the repetition was authorized or
intended by the original defamer, or . . . the repetition was
reasonably to be expected.")
The facts as set forth above establish that Maxwell
approved the Press Release. The Press Release was sent to
between six and 30 media representatives by Gow as an employee
56


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page57 of 76
of Acuity Reputation, the public relations firm hired by
Maxwell. The initial
sentence of the Press Release - "Please
find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Maxwell" -
communicates
Maxwell's authorization for the media recipients of
the Press Release to publish it. See Nat'I Puerto Rican Day
Parade, Inc. V. Casa
Pubs., Inc., 79 A.D.3d 592, 595 (N.Y. App.
Div. Ist Dep't 2010) (affirming the refusal to dismiss
defamation counts against a defendant who "submitted an open
letter that was published in [al newspaper, and that [the
defendant] paid to have the open letter published, " finding that
the defendant "authorized [the newspaper] to recommunicate his
statements.").
Maxwell has cited Geraci v. Probst in support of her
position, but Geraci is distinguishable from the instant action.
In Geraci, the defendant sent a letter to the Board of Fire
Commissioners, and, more than three years later, a newspaper
published the letter. The court held that the defendant was not
liable for that belated publication, "made years later without
his knowledge or participation." 938 N.E.2d at 919. Here, unlike
in Geraci, the Press Release was not published "without [her]
authority or request," but rather with Maxwell's authority and
57


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page58 of 76
by her express request. Gow's testimony establishes Maxwell's
authority and control over the Press Release:
When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to
Ms. Maxwell's retention of your services?
A. Yes, I
was
A.
***
The subject line does have "FW" which to me indicates
it's a forward. Do you know where the rest of this
email chain is?
My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the
UK, but Mr. Barden was not necessarily accessible at
some point in time, so this had been sent to him
originally by Ms. Maxwell, and because he was
unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate
action. I therefore respond, "Okay, Ghislaine, I'1l go
with this."
It is my understanding that this is the agreed
statement because the subject of the second one is
"Urgent, this is the statement" so I take that as an
instruction to send it out, as a positive command:
"This is the statement."
Maxwell also cites Davis v. Costa-Gavras, involving a
libel claim against an author who wrote a book about a military
coup in Chile. 580 F. Supp. at 1085. Years after the author
published the book, a third-party publishing house republished
the book in paperback form and a third-party filmmaker released
a movie based on the book. The book author did not actually
participate in the republications, though he was aware of the
58


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page59 of 76
projects. The court held that the author of the book could not
be held liable for the republications, explaining that a "party
who is 'innocent of all complicity' in the publication of a
libel cannot be held accountable." 580 F. Supp. at 1094
(internal citations omitted). The court further noted that
"active participation in implementing the republication
resurrects the liability." Id. Likewise, in Karaduman V.
Newsday, Inc., 416 N.E.2d 557 (1980), also cited by Maxwell, the
court held that reporters of a
series of articles on narcotics
trade "cannot be held personally liable for injuries arising
from [thel subsequent republication in book form absent a
showing that they approved or participated in some other manner
in the activities of the third-party republisher." Id. at 559-
560. However, the court explicitly noted that this result was
required because "the record [wals barren of any concrete
evidence of the reporters' involvement in the republication of
the newspaper series." Id. at 540.
Here, there is evidence
in the record that Maxwell
"actively participated" in influencing the media to publish the
Press Release, Davis, 580 F. Supp. at 1094, and "approved" of
and sought the publication of the press release, Karaduman, 416
N.E.2d at 560. Maxwell retained a public relations media
59


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page60 of 76
specialist. The Press Release was sent by Maxwell's express
request. Gow's testimony about the process leading up to the
dissemination of the Press Release indicates that Maxwell did,
indeed, "authorize or intend" for the media recipients to
publish the statement. Because there are sufficient facts to
demonstrate Maxwell's authority and control over the publication
the Press Release, Maxwell's liability for the Press
Release's publication survives the motion for summary judgment.
Maxwell has additionally asserted that subjecting her
to liability for republication is "particularly unfair" because
excerpts of the Press Release, rather than the whole statement,
were published. Def.'s Reply at 9. Maxwell cites to Rand V. New
York Times Co., 75 A.D.2d 417 (N.Y. App. Div. Ist Dep't 1980),
in which a newspaper paraphrased the defendant's opinion,
essentially "excisling] the opinion from the context in which it
was given." Id. at 424. No similar alteration, sanitization,
hyperbolizing, or paraphrasing of Maxwell's statements has been
established here. Nor does the
record establish that any
statements of Maxwell's were taken out of context; rather, they
were directly quoted, accurately and unchanged. The publication
of Maxwell's statement that Giuffre's claims are "obvious lies"
60


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page61 of 76
does not distort or misrepresent the message Maxwell intended to
convey to the public with the Press Release.
Because the purpose of the issuance of the Press
Release was publication, Maxwell is liable for its content and
the motion for summary judgment on the grounds of non-liability
for republication is denied.
The Motion for Summary Judgment to Dismiss the Defamation
Claim on the Ground of Substantial Truth is Denied
Maxwell has asserted that the Press Release is
substantially true and that the defamation claim should
therefore be dismissed. See Def.'s Br. at 39. Whether or not
Giuffre lied about Maxwell's involvement in the events that
Giuffre has alleged took place is the intensely contested
factual issue that is the foundation of this action.
Accordingly, summary judgment is
not appropriate. See Mitre
Sports Intern. Itd. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d
240, 255 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (denying summary judgment because it
would require the Court to decide disputed facts to determine
whether the statement at issue was substantially true); Da Silva
v. Time Inc., 908 F. Supp. 184, 187 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (denying
motion for summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of
61


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page62 of 76
material
fact as to whether defamatory photo and caption were
true) .
Under New York law, "truth is an absolute, unqualified
defense to a civil defamation action" and "'substantial truth'
suffices to defeat a charge of libel." Jewell v. NYP Holdings,
Inc., 23 F. Supp. 2d 348, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted). A statement is
substantially true if the statement would not "have a different
effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded
truth would have produced." Id. (quoting Fleckenstein v.
Friedman, 193 N.E. 537, 538 (N.Y. 1934)). Thus, "it is not
necessary to demonstrate complete accuracy to defeat a charge of
libel. It is only necessary that the gist or substance of the
challenged statements be true." Printers II, Inc. V.
Professionals Publishing, Inc., 784 F.2d 141, 146 (2d Cir.
1986); see also Korkala v. W.W. Norton & Co., 618 F.Supp. 152,
155 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) ("Slight inaccuracies of expression are
immaterial provided that the defamatory charge is true in
substance.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);
Sharon v. Time, Inc., 609 F.Supp. 1291, 1294 (S.D.N.Y. 1984)
("Defendant is permitted to prove the substantial truth of this
statement by establishing any other proposition that has the
62


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page63 of 76
same 'gist' or 'sting' as the original libel, that is, the same
effect on the mind of the reader.").
The Honorable Loretta A. Preska has noted that cases
addressing whether a statement is substantially true "fall along
a broad spectrum." Jewell, 23 F. Supp. at 367. There are cases
in which a statement is non-actionable because it is completely
true. See, e.g., Carter, 233 A.D.2d 473, 474 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d
Dep't 1996) (claim that defendant committed libel by informing
the authorities that plaintiff was endorsing checks made payable
to the defendant and depositing them in plaintiff's account held
non-actionable where plaintiff had in fact endorsed checks made
payable to the defendant). There are cases where "one struggles
to identify any area of ambiguity as to truth." Jewell, 23 F.
Supp. at 368; see, e.g., Miller v. Journal-News, 211 A.D.2d 626,
627 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dep't 1995) (statement that plaintiff was
"suspended" substantially true where plaintiff was placed on
"administrative leave"). There
are cases where the line between
the statement and the admitted truth is more tenuous, but the
overall "gist" cannot be said to be substantially different.
See, e.g., Guccione v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 800 F.2d 298,
302-03 (2d Cir. 1986) (holding that statement which implied that.
plaintiff was then currently an adulterer was substantially true
63


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page64 of 76
where plaintiff had ceased being an adulterer but had
"unabashedly committed adultery" for thirteen of seventeen
years). Finally, there
are "those cases in which a defendant
simply asks too much in asserting that a statement is
substantially true because the difference between the two is
plainly substantial." Jewell, 23 F. Supp. at 368. For example,
the court in Da Silva, 908 F. Supp. at 186-87, held that a
photograph of plaintiff which identified her as a prostitute was
not substantially true where the plaintiff had been a prostitute
for some six years but was not at the time of publication.
After reviewing this spectrum of cases, the facts upon
which Maxwell bases her argument are insufficient to allow this
Court to find substantial truth as a matter of law. A material
dispute of fact exists as to the "admitted truth" or the
"reality" in this case. Maxwell has cited to various facts to
counter Giuffre's claims, such as Giuffre's high school
enrollment, short-term jobs, and lack of record on private
flight logs during some of the relevant time period, as evidence
that Maxwell and Epstein did not abuse Giuffre. The details and
significance of the facts offered are highly contested, and
therefore cannot establish the "substantial truth" of the Press
Release. "[Reasonable jurors could conclude that the statements
64


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page65 of 76
• are not substantially true." Boehner v. Heise, 734 F.
supp. 2d 389, 399 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).
The motion for summary judgment to dismiss the
defamation on the ground of substantial truth is denied as not
having been established by undisputed material facts.
VI. The Defamation Claim is Not Barred by New York Law
Maxwell has moved to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that the Press Release is opinion and protected by the
pre-litigation privilege under New York law. Because New York
law does
not support Maxwell's position, the motion for summary
judgment based on the characterization of the Press
Release as
opinion and as protected by a pre-litigation privilege is
denied.
1.
The Press Release is Not Opinion.
As previously held, Maxwell's statement that Giuffre's
claims of sexual
assault are lies is not an expression of
opinion:
65


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page66 of 76
First, statements that Giuffre's claims 'against
[Maxwell] are untrue,' have been 'shown to be
untrue,'
and are 'obvious lies' have a specific
and readily understood factual meaning: that
Giuffre is not telling the truth about her
history of sexual abuse and [Maxwelll's role, and
that some verifiable investigation has occurred
and come to a definitive conclusion proving that
fact. Second, these statements (as they
themselves allege), are capable of being proven
true or false, and therefore constitute
actionable fact and not opinion. Third, in their
full context, while [Maxwell]'s statements have
the effect of generally denying Giuffre's story,
they also clearly constitute fact to the reader.
Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).
This Court further concluded that
[Giuffrel cannot be making claims shown to be
untrue that are obvious lies without being a
liar. Furthermore, to suggest an individual is
not telling the truth about her history of having
been sexually assaulted as a minor constitutes
more than a general denial, it alleges something
deeply disturbing about the character of an
individual willing to be publicly dishonest about
such a reprehensible crime. [Maxwell]'s
statements clearly imply that the denials are
based on facts separate and contradictory to
those that [Giuffrel has alleged.
Id.
Maxwell argues that the "context" of the entire
statement "tested against the understanding of the average
reader" should be that of a press release as a whole being read
only by journalists. Def.'s Br. at 22 (quoting Aronson V.
Wiersma, 483 N.E.2d 1138, 1139 (1985)). However, the ultimate
66


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page67 of 76
audience for a press release is the public. The motion to
dismiss opinion clearly addressed this
issue:
Sexual assault of a minor is a clear-cut issue;
either transgression occurred or it did not.
Either Maxwell was involved or she was not. The
issue is not a matter of opinion, and there
cannot be differing understandings of the same
facts that justify diametrically opposed opinion
as to whether Maxwell was involved in Giuffre's
abuse as Giuffre has claimed. Either Giuffre is
telling the truth about her story and Maxwell's
involvement, or Maxwell is telling the truth and
she was not involved in the trafficking and
ultimate abuse of Giuffre.
Giuffre, 165 F. Supp. at 152.
Maxwell has urged that these conclusions at the motion
to dismiss stage should be revisited and revised when
considering the summary judgment motion since the standard for
deciding a Rule 12(b) (6) motion is different from the standard
for deciding a
Rule 56 motion. In deciding a 12 (b) (6) motion,
the court must accept as true the factual allegations and draw
all inferences in the plaintiff's favor; a plaintiff need only
state
a claim that is "plausible on its face." Id. at 149
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In contrast,
for a Rule 56 motion, the plaintiff defending the motion may not
"rest on [thel allegations" in her complaint. Anderson, 477 U.S.
at 249.
67


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page68 of 76
In deciding its motion to dismiss opinion, the Court
relied on Davis v. Boeheim, 22 N.E.3d 999 (2014), and held that
the three allegedly defamatory statements in the Press Release
have a specific and readily understood factual meaning, are
capable of being proven true or false, and "clearly constitute
fact to the reader." Giuffre, 165 F. Supp. at 152. The Court
determined that "It]he dispositive inquiry" for purposes of
deciding whether an allegedly defamatory statement is fact or
nonactionable opinion is whether "a reasonable reader could have
concluded
that the statements were conveying facts about the
plaintiff." Id. at 151 (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). To answer that inquiry, three factors enumerated in
Davis were applied. See id. These three factors are the same as
the four factors
in Immuno AG v. Moor-Jankowski, 567 N.E.2d 1270
(N.Y. 1991); the difference is that the Davis court collapsed
the Immuno AG's third and fourth factors into one. See Davis, 22
N.E.3d at 1005. "IT]he critical aspect of the inquiry, as
articulated in the third factor set forth above, is to view the
statements in context." Jewell, 23 F. Supp. 2d at 377. This
contextual analysis "proceeds on two levels, the 'broader social
setting' of the statements, as well as their 'immediate
context.'" Id. (citing Immuno, 567 N.E.2d at 1280).
68


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page69 of 76
Maxwell acknowledges that the Court properly applied
Davis at the motion to dismiss stage, but argues that the third
factor, especially, benefits from the evidence presented in the
motion for summary judgment. See Def.'s Br. at 32. In other
words, Maxwell argues that "the Court did not have the 'full
context'" of the Press
Release or the "broader social context
and surrounding circumstances of the statement." Id. At the
motion to dismiss stage, the text of the Press Release had not
yet been produced, nor had there been production of emails or
deposition testimony regarding the Press Release.
The developed record necessitates the same conclusion
as
at the motion to dismiss stage. The context and surrounding
circumstances remain the same. The publication was
intended by
Maxwell to reach the average reader, not simply the reporters,
Barden's intent, a factual issue in contest, notwithstanding.
The issue of truth or falsity is a factual determination, not a
matter of opinion.
See Giuffre, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 152
("[S]tatements that Giuffre's claims 'against [Maxwelll are
untrue,' have been
'shown to be untrue,' and are 'obvious lies'
have a specific and readily understood factual meaning.").
69


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page70 of 76
2. The Pre-Litigation Privilege is Inapplicable.
Maxwell has contended that the pre-litigation
privilege as enunciated in Front, Inc. V. Khalil, 28 N.E.3d 15,
16 (N.Y. 2015), applies. See Def.'s Br. at 33.
"A privileged communication is one which, but for the
occasion on which it is uttered, would be defamatory and
actionable." Park Knoll Assocs. v. Schmidt, 451 N.E.2d 182, 184
(N.Y. 1983). "[Ilt is well-settled that statements made in the
course of litigation are entitled to absolute privilege." Front,
28 N.E.3d at 18. The privilege that protects statements made in
the course of litigation "can extend to preliminary or
investigative stages of the process, particularly where
compelling public interests are at stake." Rosenberg v. Metlife,
Inc., 866 N.E.3d 439, 443 (N.Y. 2007). In Front, the New York
Court of Appeals ruled that the privilege for "statements made
by attorneys prior to the commencement of litigation" is
qualified rather than absolute. Id. at 16. Specifically, the
Court held that an attorney's statements
made before litigation
has commenced are privileged if (1) the attorney has "a good
faith basis to
anticipate litigation" and (2) the statements are
"pertinent to that anticipated litigation." Id. at 20.
70


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page71 of 76
The anticipated litigation, according to the Press
Release, was "redress at the repetition of such old defamatory
claims." See Press Release. According to Barden, Maxwell's
lawyer, he participated in the preparation of the Press Release,
the purpose of the Press Release was to dissuade the media from
publishing Giuffre's allegations, and the implication of the
Press Release was that any redress sought by Maxwell would be
against the media. Giuffre has disputed Barden's claim that the
Press Release was his own statement.
Certain of the cases cited by Maxwell in support of
the privilege can be distinguished, according to Giuffre, in
that they involve communications to or from parties to the
ultimate litigation. See, e.g., Kirk v. Heppt, 532 F. Supp. 2d
586, 593 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (the communication at issue was made by
an attorney's client to the attorney's malpractice carrier
concerning the client's justiciable controversy against the
attorney over which the clients actually sued); Black v. Green
Harbour Homeowners' Ass'n, Inc., 19 A.D.3d 962, 963 (N.Y. App.
Div. 3d Dep't 2005) (privilege applied to a letter sent by a
home owner's association board of directors to the association's
members informing them of the status of litigation to which the
71


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page72 of 76
association was a party). Giuffre contends that "there was no
statement made by anyone before the commencement of litigation
because litigation never commenced." See Pl.'s Opp'n at 42.
Here, the communication at issue was sent to members
of the media, and no litigation took place between Maxwell and
the media recipients of the Press Release.
However, the pre-litigation privilege is not limited
to statements between parties and their lawyers. "While the
communications at issue in Front were among lawyers and
potential parties, the New York Court of Appeals did not
explicitly require the recipient of the challenged statements to
be a lawyer or potential party." Feist v. Paxfire, Inc., No. 11
CIV. 5436 (IGS), 2017 WL 177652, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 17, 2017);
see Front, 28 N.E.3d at 16-17. The Second Circuit "summarily
rejected this interpretation when it applied Front to an
attorney's communications to the press." See Tacopina v.
O"Keeffe, 645 F. App'x 7, 8 (2d Cir. 2016) ("Even crediting [the
plaintiffl's allegation that [the attorney] shared the affidavit
with the Daily News before filing it in court, Tacopina has
still not sustained his burden of showing that the statements
were not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation.").
72


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page 73 of 76
Though a statement made to a non-party may be
privileged, the pre-litigation privilege does not apply here
because the Press Release cannot be considered a "statement []
made by [an] attorney." Front, 28 N.E.3d at 16. Whether
Maxwell's attorney, Barden, had a hand in drafting the Press
Release, and the extent to which he may have been involved, is a
disputed issue of fact. The record evidence establishes that,
regardless, the Press Release is properly attributable to
Maxwell. Maxwell retained a public relations firm and sent her
representative there, Gow, a forwarded email with the statements
that were to be used in the Press Release. Maxwell instructed
Gow to send it, as he testified in his deposition. While Maxwell
herself did not disseminate the email to the media recipients,
neither did Barden. The statement was sent out by Gow.
Additionally, the alleged defamatory statements in the
Press Release were attributed to Maxwell, and not to her
attorney or his agents. The email stated that the Press Release
was
a "statement on behalf of" Maxwell and notified the media
recipients
that "Inlo further communication will be provided by
her
[Maxwell] on this matter." There is no evidence in the email
73


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page74 of 76
that the Press Release was anything near an attorney's
statement; Barden was not even copied on the email.
The pre-litigation privilege is intended to protect
attorneys from defamations claims "so that those discharging a
public function may speak freely to zealously represent their
clients without fear of reprisal or financial hazard." Id. at
18. Where the statement cannot be attributed to an attorney,
there is no justification for protecting it by privilege.
In addition, as this Court concluded in denying
Maxwell's motion to dismiss, "It]here is no qualified privilege
under New York law when such statements are spoken
with malice,
knowledge of their falsity, or reckless disregard for their
truth." Giuffre, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 155 (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). It is Giuffre's contention that
Maxwell knew the statements were false because she engaged in
and facilitated the sexual abuse of Giuffre. Therefore,
according to Giuffre, they were not made in good faith
anticipation of litigation, and instead were made for the
inappropriate purpose of "bullyling]," "harass]ment]," and
"intimidlation]." See Front, 28 N.E.3d at 19 (2015). According
to Giuffre, there is ample record evidence that Maxwell acted
74


Case 18-2868, Document 287, 08/09/2019, 2628251, Page 75 of 76
with malice in issuing the Press Release, thereby making the
pre-litigation privilege inapplicable.
Because of the existence of triable issues of material
fact rather than opinion and because the pre-litigation
privilege is inapplicable, the motion for summary judgment is
denied.
