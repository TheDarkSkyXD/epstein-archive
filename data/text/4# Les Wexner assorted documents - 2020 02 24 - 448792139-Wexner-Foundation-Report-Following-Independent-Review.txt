1. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF REPORT 

The July 6, 2019, arrest of Jeffrey E. Epstein (“Epstein”) on federal charges of sex 
trafficking of minors prompted wide-ranging national and international media coverage 
concerning Epstein and his ties to well-known people, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and 
Prince Andrew. Included in this coverage were mentions of Epstein’s business relationship with 
the Wexner family prior to 2008, including the fact that Epstein served as a Trustee of the Wexner 
Foundation (the “Foundation’’) for fifteen years, from 1992-2007. News reports also claimed that 
Epstein gave $46 million to a Wexner-related foundation. These news reports prompted questions 
and concerns from some constituents within the Foundation’s community, including some Wexner 
Fellows, Members and Alumni—those who have received funding from the Foundation for various 
leadership initiatives, all focused on developing Jewish leaders in the United States and public 
service leaders in Israel and throughout the world. Some Fellows, Members and Alumni expressed 
concern about whether their Foundation fellowships or leadership programs may have been 
funded, in some way, by Epstein. Others questioned whether Epstein used his association with the 
Foundation to commit any crimes. 

A. Scope of the Review 

The Foundation engaged our firm to provide an independent review of Epstein’s 
relationship with the Foundation. The goal of this review was to provide unbiased information to 
the Foundation’s leadership regarding any economic, leadership, or other impact Epstein may have 
had on the Foundation, its operations, and its programs. In doing this review, we specifically 
looked at the following questions: 


1. What was the nature and extent of Epstein’s relationship and interactions with the 
Foundation? 


Ze Did Epstein make any financial contributions to the Foundation and, if so, how did 
the Foundation use any such contributions? 


a Did Epstein use his ties to the Foundation to commit any crimes? 

B. Foundation Documents We Examined 

In conducting our review, we examined thousands of pages of Foundation documents, 
including the following: 


e The Foundation’s formation and governance documents; 

e Actions taken by Foundation Trustees; 

e Foundation records concerning contributions and other funds received by the 
Foundation; 

e Records of the Foundation’s processes for receiving and reviewing fellowship 
applications; 

e Records of the recipients of fellowship funds; 

e Records of the expenditures relating to the other charitable purposes of the Foundation; 

e Records relating to the administrative expenses of the Foundation; and 

e The Foundation’s financial statements. 


Many of these records are publicly available in the Foundation’s Form 990-PFs, filed as 
required by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Form 990-PF is the report that private 
foundations must file each year with the IRS, which requires detailed disclosures of revenues and 
expenses by category of revenue and expense. The Form 990-PF also contains detailed 
disclosures regarding contributions received and grants made by the reporting foundation. We 
reviewed each of the Foundation’s annual reports for the period 1991-2018. The Foundation’s 
Form 990-PFs were prepared and signed by certified public accountants and submitted to the IRS. 

Our review determined that the Foundation’s archive of emails does not go back to 
Epstein’s time as a Trustee, so we were unable to locate any relevant emails. We also learned that 
Epstein never had a Foundation email address. 

C; Other Documents and Information We Examined 


We also reviewed more than 3,600 pages of documents relating to other entities and 


agreements, and publicly available or web-searchable information, including the following: 


e Incorporation documents and subsequent Ohio Secretary of State filings for the Wexner 
Family Charitable Fund and its predecessor, the Leslie H. Wexner Charitable Fund; 

e Form 990-PFs for the Wexner Family Charitable Fund and its predecessor, the Leslie 
H. Wexner Charitable Fund, for the years 2001-2018; 

e Form 990-PFs for the Wexner Heritage Foundation (which merged into the Foundation 
in 2005), for the years 1991-2005; 

e Form 990-PFs for the YLK Charitable Fund, for the years of its existence, 2008-2010; 

e Form 990-PFs for two charitable organizations associated with Jeffrey Epstein, the 
C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Inc. (2001-2012, the year of its dissolution) and Epstein 
Interests, Inc. (2001-2012); 

e Charitable trust agreements relevant to our review; 

e Publicly available criminal investigative and indictment documents, and civil 
pleadings, concerning Epstein; 

e Media reports and references to the Wexner Foundation and its programs, the Wexner 
family, and Jeffrey Epstein; and 

e Other miscellaneous records we considered relevant to our review. 


D. Interviews We Conducted 

We interviewed all of the current and former Presidents of the Foundation (Rabbi Maurice 
Corson, Larry Moses and Rabbi Elka Abrahamson), as well as Leslie and Abigail Wexner. We 
also interviewed a number of current and former Foundation Trustees and Officers, a Wexner 
Graduate Fellowship alumna, and former leaders of the Wexner Heritage Foundation. The 
Foundation did not impose any constraints on these interviews (or any aspect of our review) and 
cooperated fully with our requests for information. Our interviews included: 


e Rabbi Maurice Corson (Foundation President, 1985-1998); 

e Larry Moses (Foundation employee, 1987-2011; Foundation Vice President, 1993— 
1998; Foundation President, 1998-2011); 

e Rabbi Elka Abrahamson (Foundation employee, 2000—Present; Foundation Vice 
President, 2005-2011; Foundation President, 201 1—Present); 

e Cindy Chazan (Foundation employee, 1999-2017; Foundation Vice President, 2011- 
2016; Foundation Senior Advisor, 2016-2017); 

e Rabbi Shoshana Gelfand (Member of the Foundation’s first Graduate Fellowship class; 
Wexner Heritage Foundation, 1996-2004, including as Vice President and Acting 
Director); 

e Gideon Kaufman (Foundation Trustee, 2007—Present); 


e Dennis Hersch (Foundation Trustee, 2008—Present); 

e Peg Ugland (Employee of Wexner Investment Company/N.A. Property, Inc., 1984— 
Present, with titles of Controller and Vice President, and overseeing finance, 
accounting and human resources for Wexner-related entities, including the Foundation; 
Foundation Treasurer, 2009—Present); 

e Rabbi Nathan Laufer (Wexner Heritage Foundation employee, 1986-2003, including 
as Director of Programs, Vice President, and President/CEO); 

e Leslie Wexner (Foundation Founder, Donor and Trustee since 1973; Foundation 
President, 1973-1985); and 

e Abigail Wexner (Foundation Donor; Foundation Trustee since 2006). 

This Report contains our factual findings and conclusions in connection with the above- 

described review. 
II. FACTS IDENTIFIED AND CONCLUSIONS REACHED 


From our review, we identified the following facts concerning the Foundation and 


Epstein’s interaction and involvement with the Foundation: 


A. Wexner Foundation Background 
1. The Foundation’s 1973 Formation and Its Charitable Goals 

The Foundation is an Ohio private charitable foundation formed in 1973 by the Wexner 
family. The Foundation operates its own independent charitable programs through paid 
professional staff. The stated goal of the Wexner Foundation is to be a source of enduring benefit 
to humankind, with a special commitment toward strengthening Jewish life in North America, 
Israel and throughout the world. The Foundation’s priority is the enhancement and improvement 
of Jewish education and leadership. 


Z The Foundation’s 1993 and 2005 Mergers with Other Wexner-Related 
Charitable Foundations 


The Wexner family has formed a number of private charitable foundations, several of 
which have merged into the Wexner Foundation. On July 16, 1985, Leslie Wexner formed the 


Leslie H. Wexner Foundation. In 1993, the Leslie H. Wexner Foundation merged into the Wexner 


Foundation. Leslie Wexner also founded the Wexner Heritage Foundation in 1985, with Rabbi 
Herbert A. Friedman. The Wexner Heritage Foundation merged into the Foundation in 2005. At 
the time of this second merger, the Wexner Heritage Foundation had for many years operated a 
fully-formed program, the Wexner Heritage Program, with the support of the Foundation. After 
the merger, the Foundation continued to operate the Wexner Heritage Program. 

3. Foundation Offices, Leadership and Staff 

The Foundation maintains offices at 8000 Walton Parkway, New Albany, Ohio. In 1985, 
Rabbi Maurice Corson was hired to be the Foundation President. Since that time, the Foundation’s 
leadership and staff have carried out the day-to-day operations of the Foundation in a largely 
autonomous manner, with ultimate oversight by Leslie and Abigail Wexner. 

Four Presidents have served the Foundation. Leslie Wexner was the President from the 
formation of the Foundation until 1985. Rabbi Corson served as President from 1985 until 1998. 
Larry Moses succeeded Rabbi Corson, from 1998 to 2011 and, since 2011, Rabbi Elka 
Abrahamson has served as President. 

The Foundation’s staff is independent of any other Wexner-related entity with the 
exception of its accounting and tax-related functions, such as payroll, general ledger accounting, 
accounts payable, banking, and Form 990-PF preparation, which are handled by the accounting 
department of N.A. Property, Inc., a Wexner family financial office providing services for the 
family’s financial and real estate interests. 

The Foundation’s paid staff, under the direction of the Foundation’s President, carry out 
all of the Foundation’s charitable operations, including but not limited to community outreach and 
Fellow/Member recruitment, application evaluation and selection, program development, program 


administration, and alumni relations. The Foundation currently employs twenty-one people. 


4. Foundation Programs 


The Foundation accomplishes its goals through a number of related and well-established 
programs, which include: 


e Wexner Graduate Fellowship/Davidson Scholars Program. The Wexner Graduate 
Fellowship/Davidson Scholars Program, active since 1988, awards fellowships to North 
Americans to pursue full-time graduate study in order to pursue careers in professional 
Jewish leadership. The Graduate Fellowships provide scholarships of $30,000 each year 
for a two-year term, with possible renewal for a third year. Graduate Fellowships are 
awarded to outstanding candidates who have a strong personal commitment to the Jewish 
community, who have demonstrated excellence in academic achievement, and who possess 
the potential to provide outstanding professional leadership that will shape the future of 
Jewish communal life in North America. 





e Wexner-Israel Fellowship Program. The Wexner-Israel Fellowship Program was 
established in 1989 to enable up to ten outstanding Israeli government officials each year 
to study for a Master’s Degree at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of 
Government. The stated goal of the Wexner-Israel Fellowship Program is “to provide 
Israel’s next generation of leaders with advanced public management training. Through 
the Kennedy School’s faculty, curriculum, students, and research centers, the Wexner- 
Israel fellows will have a rich environment for reflecting on Israel’s policy problems and 
potential remedies.” 





e Wexner Heritage Program. Since 1985, the Wexner Heritage Program has worked to 
strengthen Jewish community leaders by making educational resources and experienced 
clergy and faculty available to selected Jewish communities, allowing the intensive study 
of biblical text, history, philosophy and law. The Foundation began operating the Wexner 
Heritage Program in December 2005, when the Wexner Heritage Foundation merged into 
the Foundation. Prior to the merger, the Foundation granted funds annually to the Wexner 
Heritage Foundation to operate the program. 





e Recent Additional Programs. In more recent years, the Foundation has expanded its 
programs to include Wexner Service Corps (2013), which is focused on engaging Jewish 
teens in service learning; Wexner Senior Leaders (2014), which increases skills of 
collaborative leadership and transformative change within senior leaders in the Israeli 
public sector; and Wexner Field Fellowship (2016), which supports professional growth 
among existing professional leaders in the North American Jewish community. 





e Wexner Summits. Wexner Summits bring together alumni from all five of the 
Foundation’s adult programs “to work together to confront major challenges facing the 
Jewish world.” 


5, Financial Scope of the Wexner Foundation’s Work 
We reviewed the Form 990-PFs for the Foundation for the period 1991-2018. The Form 
990-PFs reflect that the Foundation paid a total of more than $321 million in pursuit of its 
charitable purposes over that time period. 
The following chart reflects the annual amounts expended by the Foundation on its 
charitable purposes, from 1991-2018:

6. Sources of Funding of the Wexner Foundation 


Foundation records we reviewed reflect that, since its formation in 1973, the Foundation 
has received approximately 90% of its funding (approximately $288 million) from the Wexner 


family. This funding includes direct contributions, as well as contributions through the Wexner 


Family Charitable Fund (formerly the Leslie H. Wexner Charitable Fund) and other charitable 
funds, trusts, and entities holding Wexner family assets. 

Other notable and regular contributors to the Foundation are the William Davidson 
Foundation and the Jim Joseph Foundation. Numerous foundations and other philanthropists in 
communities served by the Wexner Heritage Program also made meaningful contributions to the 
Foundation. 

Foundation records that we reviewed, going back to its formation in 1973, reflect that 
Epstein made no contributions to the Foundation, either personally or through his foundations or 
business interests. 

7. The Foundation’s Funding From the Wexner Family Charitable Fund 

Beginning in 2002, the Wexners began focusing their funding of the Foundation, as well 
as their funding of many other charitable causes, through the Wexner Family Charitable Fund. 
During the years 2002—2018, the Wexners contributed more than $580 million to the Wexner 
Family Charitable Fund, which then made grants to a variety of causes. As reflected in the Table 
below, during that same period, the Wexner Family Charitable Fund contributed more than $528 


million to various charitable organizations and causes, including $142 million to the Foundation.

$580,964,836 $528,073,248 $142,000,000 
B. What Was the Nature and Extent of Epstein’s Relationship and Interaction 


with the Foundation? 
1. Epstein’s Trustee Role 
The Foundation’s corporate records indicate that Epstein was elected as a Trustee of the 
Foundation on December 15, 1992, and he remained a Trustee until his resignation on September 
4, 2007. The documents we examined and the interviews we conducted reflected that the 
Foundation has had no contact with Epstein since his resignation as Trustee in 2007. 
According to the Foundation’s corporate records, Epstein, along with other Trustees, 
signed Board of Trustee actions necessary to carrying out corporate formalities. For example, 


grant agreements we reviewed reflect that Epstein formally approved the annual grants made by 


the Foundation to the Wexner Heritage Foundation, during the years 1993-2004. (Beginning in 
2005, the Wexner Heritage Foundation was merged into the Foundation, and the Wexner Heritage 
Program since that time has been and continues to be funded internally, as a program of the 
Foundation.) Similarly, the Foundation’s written Board actions reflect that Epstein and other 
Trustees periodically signed actions authorizing the appointment of Foundation officers and 
trustees, and signed a joint action approving of the merger of the Leslie H. Wexner Foundation 
into the Wexner Foundation in 1993. These are formalities that are of the type typically undertaken 
by foundation trustees. 


2. Epstein Played No Role in the Operation of the Foundation’s 
Fellowships or Other Programs. 


Based upon our review of Foundation records and interviews with Foundation leaders, we 
concluded that, although a Trustee, Epstein played no role in the management or administration of 
the Foundation’s operations or programs. For example, Larry Moses, who was a Foundation 
employee throughout the entire time Epstein was a Trustee—including many years as Foundation 
President—stated to us that Epstein “was absent from the organizational life” of the Foundation 
and, in fact, Moses had no contact with Epstein and never met with him. Current President, Rabbi 
Elka Abrahamson, who was a Foundation employee for part of the time Epstein was a Trustee, 
also reported that she never met with Epstein, and that he “had no role whatsoever in creating, 
executing or planning for” Foundation programs. 

Epstein never had an office at the Foundation, and none of the Foundation leaders we 
interviewed recalled ever seeing Epstein present in the Foundation offices. Foundation leaders 
consistently reported that Epstein was not involved in any aspect of the Foundation’s community 
outreach and recruitment effort, did not participate in application evaluation or Fellow selection, 


and had no involvement in the Foundation’s educational or leadership programs or their 


10 


administration. The Foundation leaders and staff we interviewed consistently stated that they did 
not recall ever seeing Epstein participate in social or networking events or other gatherings of 
Foundation staff, Fellows, Members, Alumni or other constituents. 

The selection of program Fellows and Members was and is conducted through use of 
sophisticated selection committees, many of the members of which are external to the Foundation 
and are leaders in their fields. As reported to us, including by Mr. Moses, Epstein “was never a 
part of any selection or recruitment process” and played no role in selecting Fellows or Members, 
or in otherwise interacting with the selection committees. 

Unlike some charitable organizations the operations of which are actively managed and 
carried out by working boards of trustees, the program operations of the Wexner Foundation have 
been carried out by the Foundation’s paid staff, under the leadership of the Foundation’s President. 
The Wexner family has always been in close contact with the Foundation’s staff, but the Trustees 
have played no active role in the day-to-day operations. Program evaluation and accountability 
has been and continues to be managed directly between the Foundation leadership and the principal 
donors, the Wexners. 


3. Epstein Played No Meaningful Role in the Foundation’s Budget, 
Finances or Accounting Processes. 


Similarly, based on our review of Foundation records and interviews with Foundation 
leaders, Epstein played no meaningful role in the Foundation’s budget, finances or accounting. 
Rather, program budget discussions took place between the Foundation President and either Leslie 
Wexner or, later, Abigail Wexner. Although Epstein held the title of President of the Wexner 
family financial office that performed the accounting and payroll functions for the Foundation, we 
found no evidence that Epstein played any significant role in those functions, or that he personally 


supervised them. For example, he did not personally perform any of the accounting functions for 


11 


the Foundation and did not make decisions regarding the Foundation’s use of funds. Although 
Epstein would have had access to the Foundation’s basic financial information if he had asked for 
it, the results of our interviews indicate that he rarely, if ever, asked any questions relating to the 
Foundation. 

Our review did find that Epstein’s name appears in certain legal documents and filings of 
the Foundation, such as being identified on the Foundation’s annual Form 990-PF filings as the 
person in whose care the books of the Foundation were kept. However, we learned through our 
review that Epstein had little or no personal involvement in the filings, and he was identified in 
these filings simply because of his role as President of the Wexner family financial office, which 
provided accounting and human resources/benefits services to the Foundation. The family office 
had a staff member in its accounting department who handled tax filings and, as reported to us 
during our interviews, that person worked directly with the outside accountants on the preparation 
of the Form 990-PFs. Epstein was also a named co-trustee of the Foundation’s retirement plan, 
which was handled through the family office, and on rare occasions approved payments of amounts 
called for under written agreements of the Foundation, but we saw no evidence that he influenced 
the operations of the Foundation thereby. 

C; Did Epstein Make Any Financial Contributions to the Foundation? 

1. Epstein Made No Financial Contributions to the Foundation. 

As described above, we reviewed the financial records of the Foundation for the period 
1991-2018, which included the 1992-2007 time period during which Epstein was a Trustee of the 
Foundation. The Foundation’s Form 990-PFs disclose all contributions made to the Foundation 
and list all donors of contributions of $5,000 or more. We reviewed all contributions to the 


Foundation, along with the identities of all donors, and found neither Epstein nor his foundations 


12 


or other businesses ever made a direct contribution to the Foundation at any time. The only 
donation of less than $5,000 received by the Foundation in any of these years was a donation of 
$100 in 1995, which we confirmed was not made by Epstein. 

However, we did find a reference to Epstein in the list of contributors included in the 
Foundation’s 990-PF for 2001. That Form 990-PF identifies a 2001 contribution from “Arts 
Interests Trust c/o Jeffrey Epstein,” in the amount of $9,588,560. We reviewed the July 30, 1991, 
Arts Interest Trust Agreement, pursuant to which Leslie Wexner created a charitable remainder 
trust as grantor and donated assets to the charitable remainder trust as donor. The terms of the 
trust granted to Leslie Wexner the right to receive income during the term of the trust, and also 
granted to Leslie Wexner the right to designate a charitable organization to receive the remainder 
of the assets (the “charitable remainder’) upon termination of the trust. The Foundation was the 
beneficiary of the charitable remainder trust. Although Epstein was the Trustee of the Arts 
Interests Trust, Leslie Wexner donated the assets used to fund the trust and retained the right to 
designate the charitable remainder beneficiary, and the Foundation received the assets of the trust 
at its termination, as reflected on the Foundation’s form 990-PF for 2001. 


2. Epstein’s Entities (COUQ and FTC) Transferred $46 Million in Assets 
to the YLK Charitable Fund, Not the Wexner Foundation. 


Media reports have stated that Epstein transferred $46 million to a foundation related to 
the Wexners. To be clear, Epstein did not transfer any assets to the Wexner Foundation. Epstein 
did cause the transfer of assets in January 2008 to The YLK Charitable Fund (“YLK’”), a private 
foundation formed by Abigail Wexner with the advice of counsel on December 20, 2007. On 
January 1, 2008, Epstein’s charitable foundation called The C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Inc. (““COUQ’”), 


transferred assets valued at $12,377,844 to YLK, as reflected on YLK’s Form 990-PF for 2008. 


13 


At the same time, Financial Trust Company, Inc. (“FTC”) contributed $34,280,154 to 
YLK, comprised of 201,939 shares of Apple Inc. stock, as reported on YLK’s Form 990-PFs for 
2008. Unrelated court records indicate that Epstein was the sole shareholder of FTC. The total 
book value of the assets transferred to YLK from COUQ and FTC was $46,657,998, as reflected 
on YLK’s Form 990-PF for 2008. The Form 990-PFs for each of the Foundation, the Wexner 
Family Charitable Fund and YLK reflect that the contributions COUQ and FTC made to YLK 
were the only contributions by COUQ, FTC, Epstein or any Epstein-related entity to any Wexner- 
related charity. 

3. Statements, Documents and Interviews Explaining That the COUQ 
and FTC Contributions to YLK Constituted a Partial Repayment of 
Funds Epstein Misappropriated from the Wexner Family. 

On August 8, 2019, Leslie Wexner issued a public letter to the Wexner Foundation 
Community, in which he stated that Epstein “had misappropriated vast sums of money” from the 
Wexner family during the time Epstein managed the Wexners’ personal finances. He further stated 
that the “widely reported payments Mr. Epstein made to [YLK] represented a portion of the 
returned monies. All of that money — every dollar of it — was originally Wexner family money.” 

In analyzing Mr. Wexner’s explanation, we reviewed the Form 990-PFs for COUQ for 
fiscal years 2001 through its dissolution in 2012 (March 1, 2001, through November 19, 2012). 
They reflect that the COUQ Foundation’s endowment was in fact funded almost exclusively 
through transfers of Wexner family funds. These transfers included more than $11 million in stock 
transferred from the Wexner Children’s Trust in 2001, and $10 million transferred in 2003 from 
The Leslie H. Wexner Charitable Fund (later named the Wexner Family Charitable Fund). 

Aside from the transfers of Wexner family assets to COUQ, the only other contribution 


made to COUQ during the period March 1, 2001 through February 28, 2008, was $100,000 


14 


contributed by Epstein, which is reflected on COUQ’s Form 990-PF for 2007. Because COUQ’s 
2007 fiscal year ended on February 28, 2008, we could not tell from the COUQ Form 990-PFs 
whether the $100,000 contribution was made before or after the transfer of COUQ assets to YLK 
in January 2008. In either event, the more than $21 million in assets withdrawn from Wexner 
family accounts made up all or virtually all of the assets held by COUQ at the time of COUQ’s 
transfer of assets to YLK in January 2008. When asked during our interview about the 2001 and 
2003 transfers of Wexner-related assets to COUQ, Leslie and Abigail Wexner told us they never 
knew about or authorized any transfers of their family’s assets to COUQ. 

As to the FTC contribution to YLK of its Apple Inc. stock, none of Epstein’s records were 
available to us. However, consistent with Leslie Wexner’s public statements, in our interview with 
Leslie and Abigail Wexner, they confirmed to us that all of the assets transferred to YLK, including 
the Apple Inc. stock, were received as a partial recovery of assets misappropriated from the 
Wexner family by Epstein. 


4. YLK Later Transferred Assets to the Wexner Family Charitable Fund, 
but Those Assets Were Not Necessary to the Wexner Family’s Funding 
of the Foundation. 


Regardless of the source of the assets COUQ and FTC transferred to YLK, we found no 
evidence that any of those assets were ever transferred to the Foundation. The Form 990-PFs for 
YLK and the Foundation reflect that no assets were transferred to the Foundation by YLK. 

During the several years YLK held the assets—which spanned the economic downturn of 
2008—2010—the assets depreciated significantly in value. YLK’s Form 990-PFs indicate that 
YLK also made a number of distributions to other charities unrelated to the Foundation. On 
December 27, 2010, YLK dissolved and transferred its remaining assets to the Wexner Family 


Charitable Fund. According to the Form 990-PFs for YLK and the Wexner Family Charitable 


15 


Fund, approximately $35 million in assets (the value of all the assets remaining in YLK at the 
time) were transferred to the Wexner Family Charitable Fund in late 2010 and early 2011, under 
YLK’s plan of dissolution. 

After the 2010-2011 transfers of the YLK assets to the Wexner Family Charitable Fund, 
the documents we reviewed and interviews we conducted reflect that the assets from YLK were 
not segregated from other funds within the Wexner Family Charitable Fund, and therefore we 
found no evidence that any YLK assets were, in fact, transferred to the Foundation. But, it is clear 
that none of the YLK assets were necessary to the funding of the Foundation’s work by the 
Wexners. In 2010 and every year thereafter, the Wexners’ annual contributions to the Wexner 
Family Charitable Fund significantly exceeded the Wexner Family Charitable Fund’s distributions 
to the Foundation in each such year. 

The following Table presents the contributions made directly by the Wexners (excluding 
any transfers from YLK) to the Wexner Family Charitable Fund in each year from 2010-2018, 


along with the corresponding donation by the Wexner Family Charitable Fund to the Foundation:

$79,000,000 


As this Table reflects, the Wexner Family Charitable Fund’s distributions to the Foundation after 
the Charitable Fund’s receipt of the YLK monies constituted less than 20% of funds that the 
Wexner Family contributed to the Charitable Fund during those years. 

Additionally, in all years following the December 2010/January 2011 transfers from YLK 
to the Wexner Family Charitable Fund, the Form 990-PFs for the Wexner Family Charitable Fund 
reflect that the Charitable Fund held assets of more than $125 million in fair market value at year- 
end. Therefore, while some of the YLK monies became part of the Wexner Family Charitable 
Fund in 2010-2011, and were not segregated from the Charitable Fund’s other assets and receipts, 
the YLK monies have never been necessary to the Charitable Fund’s support of the Wexner 
Foundation, because the Wexners’ annual contributions, as well as the assets retained at each year- 


end, were more than sufficient to cover the Charitable Fund’s grants to the Foundation. 


D. Did Epstein Use His Ties to the Foundation to Commit Any Crimes? 


1. We Found No Evidence That Epstein Used His Ties to the Foundation 
to Commit Sexual Assaults or Other Crimes. 


As described above, Epstein had no meaningful involvement with the Foundation while he 
was a Trustee. The Foundation’s Presidents reported having had very little or no interaction with 
Epstein regarding Foundation matters. Epstein had no office at the Foundation, and none of the 
Foundation constituents we interviewed recalled ever seeing Epstein in the Foundation offices. 

Likewise, Foundation leadership interviews reflected that Epstein did not attend 
Foundation meetings or events, and we saw no evidence to suggest that Epstein interacted with 
Foundation Fellows, Members or Alumni. From our review, the Foundation was not of any 
particular interest to Epstein, and the people we interviewed who met Epstein described him as 


showing no interest in philanthropy or the Foundation. Additionally, none of the Foundation 


17 


leaders or staff we interviewed ever received a complaint or allegation that an employee, Fellow 
or Member of the Foundation had been subjected to any inappropriate conduct by Epstein. 

Finally, we reviewed approximately 1,500 pages of criminal investigative and charge 
documents, including those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as numerous pleadings 
from the civil lawsuits currently pending against Epstein’s estate. None of those documents 
contains any allegation or suggestion that Epstein used his connection to the Foundation in 
perpetrating a crime. Accordingly, we found no evidence that Epstein ever used his ties to the 
Foundation to commit any assault or sexual misconduct, or to otherwise perpetrate any crime. 

z: The Foundation Had No Contact with Epstein after September 2007. 

In September 2007, Epstein resigned as a Trustee of the Foundation, as President of N.A. 

Property, Inc., and from all Wexner-related roles. We found no evidence that the Foundation, its 


employees, or its Fellows, Members, or Alumni had any contact with Epstein after his resignation.
