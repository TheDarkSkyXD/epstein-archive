Quarterly Update Q4 2015   =20
Announcing Polaris! Data management and Reporting and analysis.

EXECUTIVE CORNER
Announcing Polaris=E2=84=A2!

Today's software tools and technologies allow us to develop, test and dis=
seminate at an unprecedented rate the cutting edge features that users wa=
nt. Our new system provides the foundation that will allow us to takes ad=
vantage of these exciting capabilities. As such, it is not simply an exte=
nsion of our earlier version FN 9.5. Rather, it is a whole new product. W=
hile it performs many of the same functions as before, its approach and s=
cope are totally different. We are naming it: Polaris=E2=84=A2.

Polaris is independent of our previous offerings:

-- It utilizes the advantage of having two distinct segments:
       - Data management
       - Reporting and analysis

-- These two components have been engineered separately to better accompl=
ish their respective purposes. Viewing reports and extracting financial m=
eaning from information is a very different activity than retrieving and =
maintaining data in a productive manner.

-- The user interface, the underlying database and the programming langua=
ges all use the latest technology.

-- The reports and dashboards can be easily accessed on the web, anywhere=
, at any time. They will soon be available on mobile and tablet devices a=
s well.

-- There is more support for User Profiles, allowing professionals to bet=
ter manage the process of granting access to clients and other users.

More than ever before, we will be adding new features and functionality t=
o the product on a continuous basis, enabling us to be even more responsi=
ve to the needs of our users.

Polaris is a powerful tool designed for the complexities associated with =
financial reporting for the Ultra-High-Net-Worth market. It addresses the=
 full range of considerations, from the productivity of the staff to the =
special nature of reports required to inform and serve the principals.


Benefit for Existing Users

Another benefit of this distinction between products is that it also send=
s a clear message to our existing clients: We are committed to maintainin=
g support of our current FN 9.5 product for the foreseeable future.

Many of our clients are very comfortable with FN 9.5. They do not feel a =
need to switch to something as new and different as Polaris. We are happy=
 to relieve any anxiety they may have felt by continuing to provide this =
proven product that meets their needs. We think people will even start to=
 call it FN Classic.


Compatibility of Data

We understand the importance of your historic data. We therefore have a w=
ell-defined process to convert your data from FN Classic to Polaris. In f=
act, this process can identify problems in your old data and fix them bef=
ore you even start to run Polaris. Once you begin to use Polaris, however=
, you will not be able to access the Polaris data using FN Classic.


Status of Polaris

Polaris is available today. However, in order to manage the process in an=
 orderly manner, we are bringing on new users gradually. If you are inter=
ested in transitioning to Polaris, please contact our Customer Support De=
partment to arrange a date.

This is an exciting time for all Financial Navigator users and for us. We=
 look forward to working with you whether you continue to use FN Classic =
or if you choose to implement our new Polaris product.

Happy Navigating!

7 Steps for Closing out the Year & Creating a New Year=20
[http://blog.finnav.com/education/7-steps-for-closing-out-the-year-and-c=
reating-a-happier-new-year] =20

As the current year winds down, it is a good time to look ahead. We are a=
lways trying to help our family office software and accounting users incr=
ease their efficiency, so here are some tips for improving your internal =
year-end procedures for closing out the books and creating a new year in =
Financial Navigator 9.5. Please note the order of the following steps is =
simply a suggestion and could vary for some users.    =20

Step 1: Reconciliation
Verify all your bank, broker and credit card accounts as of December 31st=
, or as of the end of your Fiscal Year, by ensuring all transactions are =
entered and then reconciling Financial Navigator's records to the stateme=
nt from the bank or custodian.   =20

Step 2: Enter Adjusting Entries
Enter adjusting entries as of the end of the year. These transactions inc=
lude accrued items, bond amortization adjustments, depreciation, etc. Oth=
er adjustments, such as tax and K1 income adjustments, may be entered eit=
her in: (a) the new year, as the information is received; or (b) the prio=
r year, and you can carry forward the revised ending balances by using ou=
r Update Starting Balances feature.  =20

lty businesses. The flexibility of our software allows clients to adapt i=
t to support their unique operations, no matter how extensive or complex.=
 =20

imes need advice on the optimal way to set up specialized entities, recor=
d complex transactions, or capture and highlight key management data, etc=
. Other times, they may want advanced, or even just refresher, training o=
n how to best use the functionality in our system. Whatever their require=
ments, FNI is dedicated to supporting our clients' success.   =20

 the right solution can be very client-specific. As a result, we often ne=
ed experienced, high-level accounting experts with an in-depth understand=
ing of the capabilities of FNI's system to provide these clients with the=
 needed guidance. To bolster our efforts in this area, we are currently l=
ooking to increase the roster of outside consultants that we can call on =
for such assignments.   =20
