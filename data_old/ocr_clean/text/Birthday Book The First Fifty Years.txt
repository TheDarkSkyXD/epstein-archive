Torture
By Robert Wolfe
A Sea Gate boy was forced by
his mother to play "Flight of the
Bumble bee" and "Saber Dance"
on his squeeze box, 100 times a
day for 5 years. By the time the
lad became proficient, he was
able to play the tunes 100 times
in 10 minutes. Firemen from the
318 Hook and Ladder Division
were always called in for his
daily recital, in order to douse the
flames if the boy's fingers caught
fire from his dervish-like
Months later, the musical
lad's mom, again forced the boy
against his will, to perfonn the
two pieces at Carnegie Fall in
front of thousands attending. She
threatened to withhold his
treasured Nathan's lobster salad,
if he refused to perform
perfectly. He performed once
again, and was treated to a onepound container of his favorite
delicacy.

Beach Attack
By Lawrence Dyek
Sea Gate Observer
Lloyd Bridges "Human Fish",
a water monger, and a local tshirt clad Hippo were attacked by
a school of deadly Coney Island
Whitefish. The attack occurred
last Saturday just off the Sea
Gate Cabanas at Beach One. The
enraged Hippo then clammed
indiscriminately, and repeatedly
on the chests and faces of the
other victims. The "Human

reported a curious yellow warmth

Mel had the uncanny ability to

Customers would travel from all
5 boroughs and wait months to
buy one of the hard-to-get coins.
A local wisecracker named
Larry-John Streitman, tried to
pump Mel for information on
how to mass-produce these coins.
Fromholder was insulted and
became enraged. Mad Mei lived
up to his name when he stabbed
Streitman in the "Stomach and
the Leg" 10 times. Ironically,
Streitman was wearing a cheap
copy of Mel's original "No
Hassle Band" on his wrist when
he was attacked. "If it wasn't for
the "No Hassle Band", said
Streitman, " I woulda been

Two Sea Gate teens claim to
have started out with $500 each,

Pizza man Luigi Tortoni flew
into a fit of rage after employer

2 drops of water on it and barely
dabs at the blistering skin.
Chemical analysis of Yep's

she uses Clorox bleach in every

curiously turns yellow and has an
ammonia smell after it dries. This
happened for months until her son

Famed diminutive math teacher
Joseph "Mighty Joe" Rothman, has
been a fixture at Mark Twain JHS
for over 35 years. Students hav
taunted the midget math man ever
since he started teaching. Year
after year of being teased by the
kids have caused the man to lash
out at new students before they
ever had the chance to bother him.
This year was different; when he
failed two students due to
personality conflicts, rather than
poor grades, the students held a
"lynching" right in the classroom.
Mighty Joe was hung by his sport
coat, on a coat hook, in the
students' wardrobe. Both students
were expelled from school and Mr.
Rothman only had his pride hurt.

Near Drowning
in Chocolate
By Willy the Soda Jerk
Firestone Candy Papers
A brillo haired teenager was
nearly drowned in Fox's U bet
chocolate syrup when his four
friends held him down and poured
10 jars of the thick, rich, velvety
egg cream component. After 5
minutes of the syrup torture, the
kinky teen suffered from terminal
acne and was immediately
ambulanced to Dr. Shin Ho Yep, &
pimple specialist. The Dr. refused
treatment, as the acne was too far8
gone. "To much peempoo; cannot
fix", the doctor, said. The craterace teen now has to check his oi

Sea Gate Police Bulletin
Last Friday, 3 Sea Gate boys
perpetrated a hoax on popular math
tutor Richard "Dicky" Freed. One
boy set the scam up by mentioning
that he needed math tutoring.
knowing that Dicky would surely
zero in on this "needy student"
Freed took the boy onto the Belt
Plowy. in his navy blue 63 Chevy
Belair. Once they reached the large
gas tanks on the way to Sheepshead
Bay, two other boys who were
hiding behind the back seat popped
up and scared the dickens out of
Dicky. He temporarily lost control
of the vehicle when both arms went
off the steering wheel and up to the
roof of the vehicle as he shrieked in
fear. The 3 boys laughed
hysterically as Freed 's car
careened through 3 lanes of traffic,
almost flipping over the guard rail.

Fans wild over
Dynamite Tuna
By Chaim Gider
Mermaid Ave. Gourmet
Every so often, a genius comes
along with a new recipe that takes
the world by storm. The genius
this time?... the son of a Coney
Island fireman, who worked for
months honing the magic recipe for
the perfect tuna salad.
The entire
neighborhood waits on line for
hours outside the fireman's house,
for just one small taste of the
"miracle tuna".
. Folks can't believe
that the young lad had the wisdom
or knowledge to create such a
masterpiece in tuna.
When asked for the recipe, the
teen will only reveal one part of the
secret "It has to do with squeezing
the oil out of the tuna,
9
then rinsing it with water"
" he said.
Sources also reported seeing used
Hellman's mayo jars in the trash
cans behind the house. According
to national tuna experts, this could
be another major breakthrough in
solving the "miracle tuna" puzzle,.
The "tuna boy", as he is now
known, commented: "If you like
my tuna, wait till you taste my
fantastic "Wonder Slaw" cole slaw,
and my soon-to-be famous Galliano
Milk Shake".

Ejected from
Singles
Weekend
By Henny Youngmann
Catskills Comics
Coney Island teens signed up for
what should have been a fun
singles weekend at Kutsher's
Country Club, but something went
awry. After causing disturbance at
the pool, the young men went to
their room and made so much noise
that security had to come and warn
them of probable ejection from the
premises. Later on, the troublemakers arrived at the main
ballroom for dinner. Each table
was matched with boys and girls
for the event. Again, the boys were
causing more trouble, and by the
time the food was served, the
crowning blow occurred. One of
the teens known as "Neutral",
started eating directly out of the
large salad serving bowl. To make
things worse, he ate without knife
or fork, much like a mad dog. He
was actually foaming at the mouth,
growling, and jerking his head up
and down as he chewed the salad.
Needless to say, the boys were
immediately escorted from the
ballroom, and promptly told to
leave Kutcher's without delay.

Dearest Jeff:
Fifty years old. You really have had a pretty amazing life. Amazing because of where and when it started
Paula and Seymour fucking. Who was there to tell him where to stick it? Who told him to spit on her cun
o make it wet? Maybe they had more on the ball then we all give them credit for
Anyway from that night back in May of 1953, as they lay there intoxicated from their lovemaking, little did
they know what they would be bringing into the world early the next year. Lets fast forward to you. I
remember summers when Warren would always work some shit ass job (Nathan's) for minimum wage, l
would always find something (Male Ego in Brighten Beach) and Frog would 1o0 (Cabana Boy). But you,
Jeff would never work. Yes, you were special. You did things like music camps in Michigan, etc. Which
brings me to when you lost your virginity. You may not remember, but I was under the same roof that
could new years eve in '66 or '67 (not sure). The first time I ever flew was with you. I went with you to
Michigan to visit your friend
the Interlochen girl for new years eve. It was also the first time I had
ever laid eyes on a bright, attractive, bubbly, blue eyed, mid western female. She was like an alien to me.
She wasn't Jewish or Italian. Wasn't she your irst? My first was up in Monticello, where I spent part of
the summer with Lloyd and Andy working at Playland Arcade in Monticello. It was Lloyd's girlfriend
Anyway, back to the Michigan trip, because it was significant. Jeff, you took me with you. It was my first
time out of Brooklyn. It was no big deal, but we went. And nobody else ever WENT anywhere back when
and where we came from.
And then on to Europe. The second time I ever flew. Sabena Airlines to Brussels. Wasn't it $800 RT. In
Europe, I reaily saw a true transformation in you. You lost all of your chubbiness and I remember noticing
that you grew a few inches. We both got absolutely skinny in those weeks abroad. I will always remember
how you were constantly working the train schedules - riding by night so would have a free place to sleep
and arriving to our destinations in the morning ready to hit the sites. We'd drink in all that the cities had to
offer on a budget of $2 a day. Author Frommer's EUROPE ON $5 A DAY was for suckers. We did it
cheaper, deeper, wider and better. We saw and learned so much on that memorable trip. We hitch hiked
we biked, we trained, we ferried, we walked, we ran, we always somehow managed to get where we
wanted to go and see what we wanted to see. We slept on trains, boats, beaches, abandoned houses, flop
houses, people's homes, friend's apts. Everywhere but hotels and hostels. We were too savvy to stay in a
youth hostel - weren't we? Hell, I can't even remember us having a sit down meal on that trip. We
blankets from that youth hostel. It was freezing and wet. But things went way up from there. Especially
the time I' had a wet dream sleeping in my seat on the ferry from Brendizi (or Bari?) to Corfu. Did I share
that with you? Remember the Corfu police detained me on arrival to the Island? We had some scary
moments. That's what made it such a great experience. We stayed on Corfu for 2 weeks or so. Never got
to London because of that. Corfu was great on the budget and I remember it being great sleeping on the
beach with kids from all over the world - Matt and
too and those two girls from Cleveland.
That trip to Europe could get more space but the main point is that it really opened your eyes to another
world. And mine too. But you Jeff seized it. I did too in a sense. But you spent the next summer in
London and came home with a beautiful British babe named
You had such chuzpah to
HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000063


bring her to your beautiful, civilized, impressive home on Maple Ave. Think back on that now. That
shows a lot. It really does. You didn't give a shit about what she thought. And she couldn't have been too
impressed. You were seriously easy going - never up tight. Never worried, always confident. That aspect
of your personality, of course coupled with your brilliance and intellect is what made you who and what
you are today. That don't give a shit attitude, your calculated aloofness, your sense of humor and most
importantly that confidence came to you early on. You had to have confidence and an I don't give a shit
attitude to bring
into your Sea Gate world. It worked! You began to realize that you could get away
with shit! That chicks and people in general were schinucks! You sensed that you were sharper and more
astute than most.
Especially the ones who had women, money, position and power. Yes, your charisma and persuasive ways
came very early on. And you didn't learn life's lessons in your house. You learned them from us (me,
frog, WE) from Europe, Interlochen, our trips to the city and all the people you met along the way. Maybe
you picked up a little from Timmy, too. Remember mceting Phillie? He's 16. He said he'll always
remember how you said that Timmy taught you a lot about business. I know you enhanced that a bit, but
that was a great thing to say to a kid., and I'll never forget it either. Warren and Phillie are crazy about
each other and the kid is obviously enamoured by you and loved meeting you. It meant a lot to him and
me. He's really a great kid - has that easy going, confident manner. Good looking kid.
So now you're fifty. No sweat Jeff. You look great, you're probably in the best shape of your life and
you're not slowing down one bit. If no one told you how old you were - wouldn't you think you were 36
or something? Just don't get bored and stay healthy.
And then there's Warren. He's as hilarious as ever and exactly the same as he was 35 yrs. ago with his
trench coat and his business man's boots BACK THEN! We see each other pretty often.
Warren and I get together w/ you for at least an evening and just get Warren started, you know the way we
used to. Maybe we need to include Zucca as a prop for Warren.
If you look at our little group of you, Warren, Frog and me. We were very close, although we never said
or knew it back then. We didn't have girlfriends, we never even dated. We didn't look to our families
really for anything, we had each other. That was through high school. Then when we went to college we
were still close but we cach began go branch out from the group. We had great times and I'm convinced -
and I know this as fact: You guys made me what I became today and there's not a day that goes by that I
don't think about you. So Jeff, even though we don't speak that often, and our lives don't intersect, you
really are a part of me and I will always be grateful for the great times we had. You have been and still are
a great influence for me. You don't know it, but you're my kid's role model. That's why it's so satisfying
to recall the past with you. It has shaped both of us. When Warren and I get together, who and what do
you think we talk about? You, You, You, You, its constant - I can't stand it anymore.
That's it for now. I know I got a bit sentimental, but it's the occasion. Take good care. I'll always have
the fondest memories of our past and I can honestly say they were the best years of my life - even though 1
couldn't ever get laid

Jeffiey,
You could never imagine the surprise I felt when Ghislaine furst contacted me about writing something for your
memory book.
Over the years I have thought of Class 5-3 & 6-3, numerous times with affection and really fond memories. After all,
you guys were my second class EVER and I had just transferred from my first job, which was in, of all places, Fort
Apache, The Bronx! Imagine, coming from a class of hold-overs, delinquents, and worse, to a class of "Intellectually
Gifted Children." Believe me, it was quite a chore just to keep one step ahead of that class.
One day, about 2 weeks ago, I was on the Northern State Parkway on my way home, creeping along at 5 miles an
hour, in the midst of a snowstorm, when my cell phone rang. I spent the next 15 minutes or so reliving the past with
Warren, who was calling from sunny Dallas, Texas. As we talked and he mentioned students' names, most of the
faces flashed before my eyes. I even told him.... Jeffrey, saxophone, Michael, clarinet, Warren, saxophone and so on
for most of the class. He later sent me a picture of the class and there I was, much thinner, with black horn-rimmed
glasses and a full head of dark brown hair. There you were, just as I remembered you, with a Mona Lisa smile that
hid what was really going on in that interesting brain of yours. Who could have guessed the wonderful, fascinating
things that were in store for you?
I remember discussing Abraham Lincoln with the class and staring in wonder at the student who had read all of
Sandberg's Life of Lincoln and spouted facts of which I was totally unaware. I also remember my math (never my
strong suit) being corrected from time to time, very respectfully, by Jeffrey. I also remember the Coney Island
Cleanup Parade and performing onstage at Lafayette and blowing away the audience who had just listened to a
Junior High orchestra.
I have many awards and plaques on my office walls, at home and at work... too many for any one place, but for all
these years 1 still treasure and display the gold painted, wooden plaque that I received from your class for being the
"Best Teacher"
I'm thrilled and delighted that you still remember me and that in some small way I may have made a difference and
touched your life. Happy Birthday!
In 1963, you were around 10 and I was 23.... twice as old as you. Today you are 50 and I'm 63.... somehow you're
catching up! How did that happen?

SENT THES


Dearest Jeffrey,
if i were to list my life time achievements, surely scoring higher than you on the nineth
grade algebra regent would rank in the top ten. I'll never forget the exhilaration of
considering myself smarter than Jeffrey Epstein in math. That same year, you not only
performed mathematical magic by tutoring me to get a perfect score on the regent,
you thrilled our class in music by playing "California Dreaming" on the piano, and thrilled
me even more by stealing a kiss after "The Sound of Music" at Radio City Music Hall.
When we met again some time after college, you had shoulder length curls, wore
wonderful hand-embroidered denim work shirts and tight jeans, and drove a brown
Camaro with a glove compartment full of parking tickets. Needless to say, you had
outgrown your shyness around girls and even confessed that you participated in peace
marches because they were the easiest places to get laid. A truly unique perspective
on political activism in the 70's.
A few years later during a trip to Palm Beach, we were driving around admiring the
homes when you pointed in the direction of a particularly impressive mansion and said,
"One day, I'm going to own that." I smiled and considered your comment nothing more
than wishful thinking. Many mansions later, you have shown me the importance of
having a vision and the determination to pursue it. A lesson 1 continue to rely upon for
inspiration.
From lessons in algebra to lessons in life, the lessons l've learned from you during the
past 35 years haven't always been easy or even ones that I would have chosen to learn,
but they were always important. I'm very grateful to have you for a friend and hope
that if you ever need help solving a rate/time/distance problem, you won't hesitate to
call.
All my love,

CHARLES' DE LICHNOWSKY

Can a
Of all the works composed or planned or published in this period,
one stands out for both its fame and its substance: the Piano Sonata
in C minor, Op 13, called by Beethoven himself the Pathétique and
published by Hoffmeister of Vienna in December 1799 with a
dedication to Prince Karl Lichnowsky. The Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung (19 February 1800) praised it in high terms. Modelled
in its formal outline on ideas first tried out in one of the early
Electoral Sonatas of 1783, it more than any other of Beethoven's
works up to this time seemed to herald the dawn of the new
century. From its dramatic opening grave chords, through its
searchingly expressive, emotional Adagio to the nervous intensity
and defiance of the final Allegro, the Pathétique was a burial of the
past, a celebration of the future.
The years of apprenticeship were over, Beethoven had finally
arrived

Finally, at the home of our friend, let's call him Mr. Brown, Jeffrey
unveiled his plan. To some it may have seemed a get-rich-quick scheme, but
to me it was pure genius: Rob and Kill was the name of the plan. The first
victim,
to be attacked and brutally plundered would
she want more than that?) on the boardwalk in Venice Beach. Broad
daylight. The dastardly thieves were never caught.
Postscript: I retired from "the life", but I recently read an article in New
York which led me to believe that my old friend Mr. E had continued on and
become an industry leader.
HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000115


Jeffrey was such a nice man, a sweet, innocent type. One ot my employees
called him Mr. Epstein, the math teacher. Always ready to lend a hand, help
a friend in need. He even volunteered to help out in surgery at UCLA,
scrubbed, put on the gown, the whole bit, just to do his part.
HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000116


Then, things began to change. I think it was shortly after he encouraged
Morgan to say "woof" on the phone to me that I noticed the beginning. And
then, while his friends were willing to either go blissfully ahead, eyes closed,
trusting in the Almighty, Jeffrey began to get that look in his eye. He was
cooking up something, something either evil or at least deadly. I always
hoped he wasn't spurred to action by my action - the unforgivable, immortal
sin of getting married.

Who Was That Man With Epstein?
Enquiring minds are asking, "Who was that man with Epstein?" Jeffrey Epstein is, of
course, one of the world's most famous men, a household name throughout the planet.
His picture has appeared on the cover of every magazine in the world. Everyone knows
his story - - from his humble roots on Coney Island to his rise as one of the most envied
public figures of the western world. But what was he doing flying to Africa with an
obscure former politician from Hope, Arkansas? Who is that politician and why would
Epstein have picked him for the coveted seat on his private jet. Vanity Unfair was
determined to get to the bottom of this mystery man and to reveal the story behind the
story. Normally we would not pry into the private life of an obscure Arkansas
politician, particularly one who has tried so hard, and up to now so successfully, to keep
his private life to himself. But the moment this obscure man stepped onto the Epstein
jet, he became fair game for probing enquiry. Why would a man like Epstein, who can
pick and choose his companions from princes to professors, select a flying companion
from the Ozark Mountains? To be sure, he was a Rhodes Scholar, but we all know how
easy it is to get a Rhodes if you're from Arkansas. There must be something else.
Vanity Unfair decided to snoop around. The obscure politician reluctantly agreed to an
interview, on the express condition that it was completely off the record. This is what

"I've done a lot of soul searching, and I've come to the conclusion that I should
be thinking less about money and more about naked women, and biomathematical research.
HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000130


It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautitul women. But not many people know
that he can create them out of thin air -- at least he did in lowa in 1988.
At the time, I was managing the money of the Zimmerman family, and they lived in
Fairfield Iowa, a town of less than 10,000 people between Ottumwa and Burlington.
Hog farming is a serious industry there, and many feel there is more than a little truth
to the saying that its hard to tell the difference between the girls and the hogs in
Southeast Iowa.
I had invited Jeffrey to come to Fairfield to see our investment operations, meet the
Zimmerman family, and learn more about their major charitable projects. He asked
about the nightlife and we could only laugh as we dropped him off at the local motel.
The next morning a group of 4 of us picked up Jeffrey to give him a tour of the area.
At our first stop we parked in front of a bookstore. As we were getting out of the car,
a spectacular tall blonde woman suddenly come out of the store, walked directly past
us and up to Jeffrey and announced: "I am new to this area, what's going on?".
. It
turned out she was a sales representative for a firm selling academic branded athletic
clothing, and she was literally driving through Iowa visiting local campuses. Jeffrey
invited her to join us, and did his magic. Within a few hours, he had invited her to
return to New York with him for the weekend.
The guys in the car we astonished to even see such an attractive lady in Fairfield,
amazed that she passed over them to meet Jeff, and were speechless when she agreed
to come to New York. I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow
arranged the whole episode through some long distance escort service. But the
following week I happened to be in Manhattan and Jeffrey asked me to give her a
ride back in our company plane, giving me a chance to speak with her for a few
hours. She was the real McCoy.
Happy Birthday Jeff!
Best wishes,
Bill Elkus

The analysis: A fiercely intelligent, highly complex individual for whom the
accumulation of great wealth is no problem. Prefers working in private, or
better yet, utter secrecy. Emotionally complicated: Can run hot and cold, can
lose interest in the blink of an eye, professes to be "available" but much goes
on behind the scenes and he decides what he gives. Extensive
scientific/humanitarian/philanthropic strength and cointerest, which if
harnessed and developed properly could have a significant impact as in
tangibly changing the world for the better) and as an added bonus, beat the
current masters at their own game.

You very dear boy,
00000
Going back into the past as I have over the last few days has in some ways prooved a
melancholy experience all the old criminals suddenly came leaping out at me
Mac, Ogilvy, Swire, Baring, Alfonse, the Brigadier, the old man and all the good times that we
had together. One of the sad things in life is that fate conspires to move people apart to the
extent that I hardly see you any more but,l suppose that is why we are compensated by
memories.
000°°| was speaking to BB last night before writing this e-mail and we both agreed that we
were at a loss to decide which of the hundreds of hilarious incidents to pinpoint for you, there
are just too many. inspecting the Royal School girls dorms, chasing rabbits with Toto in the
old mans dino trying to get
husband out of the way in Manila, blocking Ogilvies loo
with the illegal goose at Barings wedding, doing three point turns in the tunnel in HK when
we asked the Mandarin driver to find us some girls, dancing the night away in the Tin Mine in
KL,massage classes at Wraxail.....and so on and so on it brings tears to my eyes.
• However, there was one evening which I recall always had you howling with laughter. We
were in Harry's Bar in London you me, the old man, Toto,
Tand the usual extraordinary
group of camp followers Lord Long, lan Gruikshank, etc etc. Somehow Toto got it into his head
that
was a call girl that doggie had fixed up for him. after dinner we all went off to
Tramps and Toto and doggie got into the back of doggies car with
sitting beiween
them. Toto grinning happily at the old man reached down and pulled
skirt up to her
panties and put his hand on her pussy. The old man smiling sweetly leaned over stuffed his
hand into her pants so that Toto found his fingers playing with doggies. Suddenly the awful
truth sunk in but Toto was too shocked to remove his hand so they drove to Tramps with
both of them still trapped in
knickers.
•°° All my love and a very very happy birthday with many more years to come in the future
than there are years behind you.
Nick.

Jeffery,
I have agonized long and hard about what to write for your
birthday.
One version was a highly philosophical take on personal
perception.
I'11
spare you
the tortured prose but the gist was that the way we see
the world
depends on our experiences - how we
parse things. You're one of
the few
people who has influenced how I parse and understand the world,
and that
version lauded you for it.
But, that seemed to heavy and pedantic, so out it went..
Another version was silly and salacious, since your approach to
life has so
much of each of these things.
A few years ago somebody at a
party asked me
"Does Jeffrey Epstein manage your money?". I replied "No, but he
advises
me on lifestyle". The guys eyes bugged out of his head and he
said
"REALLY?"
Alas I am ill prepared to comment on your lifestyle in any detail,
since I
know
little
Of!
am (sadly) so far behind that it would be talking about things I
Yet another approach was to comment on our shard interests in
science and
exploration, but again it seemed lacking.
So, in the end I have wound up with this silly excuse
for a
missive -
neither profound nor funny.
But,
I've included a few photos
that I took
on my
recent trip to Africa. They seemed more appropriate than
anything I
could put in words.

The first equation is a fundamental property of the
Riemann zeta function (that it is both a sum over all
integers and a product over primes). The zeta function
is a very important function, and this equation partially
explains why people care about it (although this may not
be apparent from the equation :-): it encodes information
about primes in a form that doesn't obviously involve primes.
The second equation is one of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
These are some pretty important identities discovered by
Ramanujan towards the end of his short life (and it turns out
Rogers had published them earlier, but nobody had noticed!).
Incidentally, are you familiar with Ramanujan? He was a remarkable
self-taught mathematician who grew up in India a century ago.

The third equation is one of Ramanujan's most elaborate
identities. I don't think it's very important in the overall
but it certainly looks impressive.

Solutions beyond the obvious.
The final picture is a paradox discovered by Lewis Carroll.
A 13-by-13 square is cut up into four pieces, which are reassembled
into an 8-by-21 rectangle. However 13^2 = 8*21 + 1. Where did the
missing unit of area go?
The first picture is a visualization of Euclid's proof of the
Pythagorean theorem. He wanted to show that the big square on
the hypotenuse had area exactly equal to those of the small squares
combined. To do this, he dropped a perpendicular line (the one in
the picture that cuts through the triangle and the big square) and
claimed that the two rectangles it divided the big square into had areas
equal to those of the small squares. To establish that, he showed
that all four shaded triangles had the same area (which is not too
hard using the 1/2-base-times-height area formula for triangles).
The structure of the proof is often obscured by using a single
covered with letters labeling various things.
13x13 = 8 × 21?

The mathematics of life
Martin Nowak
Epstein Institute, Harvard University
The primordial soup, here or elsewhere, generated a
quasispecies of aperiodic macromolecules. Quasispecies
live in sequence space, which is a collection of hyperdimensional cubes. Each cube arises by ordering all
possible sequences of a certain length in such a way that
nearest neighbors differ in only one position. The length of
the genome determines the dimension of the cube. A very
small gene, for example, lives in a 1000 dimensional cube.
Its sequence is 1 particular choice out of 10800 possibilities.
For comparison there are only 10° protons in our universe.

An alphabet is a finite list of symbols. Sentences are strings of symbols.
A language is a set of sentences. A finite language has a finite number of
sentences. An infinite language has an infinite number of sentences. There
are infinitely many finite languages.
Human languages are infinite.
A grammar is a finite list of rules that generates a language. Grammars
are equivalent to computers. Finite state grammars generate regular
languages which are accepted by finite state machines. Phrase structure
grammars give rise to computable languages which are Turing complete.
For each such language there exists a Turing machine that accepts every
sentence that is part of the language, but may compute forever on
sentences that do not belong the language.
The language of mathematics is not computable.
Learning is selection among a restricted set of hypothoco.
Ambitious learners exceed their teachers.

There are six billion intellects on Earth, but this is
the quickest one I've met (aside from Isaac Asimov);
he sees things differently from all the rest, asks
questions that no one else ever asked, and suggests
answers that no one would ever expect.

I understood years ago after ghislaine came to the Palm Beach
Horse show looking for what I thought was a horse that she was
on a mission.
For a collection of breast photos. A compilation, of course, for you.
I came to see you some months later you told me to take off my
top. With the usual Eptein smile you looked at my breasts and
said "yeah, I was right." Messory served you correctly. The beauty mark was on the right breast. One quotable memory.
To a true friend with whom I have shared many complicities...

When Jeffrey joined Bear, Stearns twenty-four years
ago, it was our plan to put him on the American Stock
Exchange floor to trade options on common stocks.
Ip until then, options had been traded Over the
Counter. Jeff said no, and that was the last difference
we ever had.
Working with Jeffrey has been a pleasure and watching
his meteoric success has given me many vicarious
thrills.
I am sure that we will see Jeffrey's star glow even
brighter.
Good luck JeffreyAu babany
