            &gt;&gt;&gt; The unfolding tragedy in Syria which already cost the lives of 75 thousands
            had culminated these days with evidence of the use of nerve agents by the Assad regime
            against his own citizens and the videotaped executions as well as canibalism &nbsp;in
            the name of God on behalf of the rebels. Have we said: "tough neighbourhood " ? lives
            lost, red lines crossed but no coordinated plan, in sight, to end it had yet emerged.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; Beyond the human suffering three main risks are embedded in this situation:
            first, the very continuation of the blood spill in a place where blood revenge is a
            cultural norm and the conflict already became a magnet for extremist groups complicates
            the ending of the bloodshed and increase the odds of post Assad Syria ending up &nbsp;as
            a failing state, a new Lebanon at best or somalia at worst.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, the possibility of much wider use of chemical weapons grows with
            every round of actual use, as the psychological thresholds and impact of external
            deterrence are waning out. And with it the prospect of chemical weapons in terrorists
            hands and the internal civil war deteriorating into much wider regional conflict. A,
            deterioration can easily develop as a result of a Syrian attempts to transfer advanced
            weapon systems to Hezbollah in Lebanon, as Israel is committed to block it. physically
            if necessary<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; Thirdly,and probably more important, the intensive ,risky and resource
            demanding dealing with the Syrian crisis might detract leaders from tackling the Iranian
            military nuclear program which in the long term is much more dangerous.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; Assad's armed forces are weak, and heavily attrited by the infighting .
            more than one player on the world stage or even in the region can destroy his airforce
            and air defence within a relatively short timeframe. but thats won't necessarily end the
            fighting or secure the CW arsenal. when one considers the alternatives which had been
            raised:no fly zone to be imposed by US, Nato orTurkish force separately or combined,"
            cordon sanitaire'" for refugees along the Turkish and Jordanian borders,US or Israeli
            attacks on the CW capabilities i feel that at this stage all options should remain on
            the table but worth a try at being avoided and the key to the shortest and life cost
            reducing path is not in any neighbour's hands ,but in Moscow. it could be argued that
            under different set of early decisions and actions we would already had won the case
            over Assad. but that doesn't matter. answers should be given now,immediately, based on
            PRESENT situation.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
            &gt;&gt;&gt; The Kremlin has at its disposal the leverages that can convince Assad to
            leave and at least to stop fighting immediately as a first step towards it. The Russian
            leaders are as clever as we are and fully understand that Assad is doomed and lost
            legitimacy.It is not too hard to asses why they are reluctant to say it loudly at this
            stage.If we want to see an end of fighting and do not want to see Jabhat al Nosra or the
            likes running Syria added probably by years of bloody massacre of Alawites and others in
            a no man's land Syria we need Russia to be asked to lead the international effort to end
            it,with all other players supporting it. in a way a mirror image of what happened in
            Libya, where Russia was asked to support &nbsp;an effort lead by the Europeans and
            backed by the US..<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; The Kremlin ,for more than forty years,invested a lot of political
            capital,financial resources and prestige in the Assads dynasty.They still do. their
            readiness to keep their commitment to give him SA300 AD and improved radars for the
            Yakhont shore to sea missiles systems is worrying . in the past they trained and
            equipped the Syrians.provided intelligence gathering capabilities, they know the CW
            units generals on first name basis . they perceived the naval outpost in Tartous and
            Latakia as strategically important for them. and they are making an effort that we don't
            like, to protect those assets.we should be realistic. the challenge is not to educate
            Russia. and even if would try it it would end up impractical. its true in the other
            direction as well/. they can't educate us/ the real challenge for both is to put an end
            to the massacre without loosing the capability of following cease fire to &nbsp;remove
            Assad &nbsp;from power. This can not be achieved &nbsp;in a simple way now without the
            Russians at a leading role. &nbsp;i don't think that a mutually agreed special role for
            Russia in post Assad Syria,including naval base rights in the above mentioned ports is a
            bad deal for all of us ,bearing in mind the alternatives. we can always turn back to the
            tougher choices if this one fails.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; The Russians are short of perfect as all of us sometimes are. but they are
            an important world power with special relevance to Eastern Europe, the Middle East and
            the Caucasus.They have their own interests and perspectives that have to be taken into
            account parallel to those of all other players. so, there will be a price for their
            readiness to lead. this price is what has to be pre negotiated. Russia might push to the
            table other issues from MD, to other points of difference with the US or its allies.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; but Putin behaved in a very responsible manner when it came to supply of
            &nbsp;advanced air defence systems to Iran. and as of now Syria is still several months
            from potentially having SA300 operational.not to mention that however modern and
            effective those systems are they are not invincible or undestroyable.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; it is my judgment that giving Russia the opportunity to lead and hopefully
            succeed in &nbsp;such an effort can &nbsp;help shaping not just Syria but Russian
            attitude towards cooperation on world stage regarding other sour issues.<br />

            &gt;&gt;&gt; news are that secretary Kerry's trip to Russia had not yet yielded this
            result. it was however an important visit that proves the sincerity of the Secretary and
            the administration in trying exhausting all alternatives before turning to tougher
            choices. I'm confident of the need to try again. thats not a zero-sum game. we have to
            retry,open minded, self confident, not out of weakness but out of sobriety regarding the
            huge toll of paralysis. no one can assure success. but it worth trying once again. even
            harder.<br />
