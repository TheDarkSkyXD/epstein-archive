 =3D=3D=3D  A letter to our consumers  =3D=3D=3D

 =3D=3D  The Next Chapter  =3D=3D

  A little over three years ago, the team at Aereo set out to build a
better television experience for the consumer. We began this journey
because we were frustrated with a system that we believed was broken and no
longer served the consumer. When it came to watching live television, the
options were few, the products available were cumbersome and didn=E2=80=99t=
 fit
our increasingly mobile lifestyle, and costs were unreasonably high and
rising. 

  With that in mind, we put our collective engineering power to work to
create an online technology that was simple, useful, and compelling, and
provided consumers with a true alternative to how they watch local live TV.
That=E2=80=99s how Aereo came to life. 

  Our engineering team created the first cloud-based, individual antenna
and DVR that enabled you to record and watch live television on the device
of your choice, all via the Internet. In less than two years, we went from
drawings on a napkin to launching Aereo=E2=80=99s technology in more than a=
 dozen
cities across the country. 

  The enthusiasm we encountered was overwhelming. The sense of frustration
consumers expressed reinforced our mission. We knew we had touched a nerve,
had created something special, and had a built something meaningful for
consumers. 

  But we encountered significant challenges from the incumbent media
companies. 

  While we had significant victories in the federal district courts in New
York and Boston and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the reversal of
the Second Circuit decision in June by the U.S. Supreme Court has proven
difficult to overcome. The U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively changed
the laws that had governed Aereo=E2=80=99s technology, creating regulatory =
and
legal uncertainty. And while our team has focused its energies on exploring
every path forward available to us, without that clarity, the challenges
have proven too difficult to overcome. 

  Accordingly, today, we filed for Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings.
We also appointed Lawton Bloom of Argus to serve as Aereo=E2=80=99s Chief
Restructuring Officer during this period. 

  Chapter 11 will permit Aereo to maximize the value of its business and
assets without the extensive cost and distraction of defending drawn out
litigation in several courts. 

  We have traveled a long and challenging road. We stayed true to our
mission and we believe that we have played a significant part in pushing
the conversation forward, helping force positive change in the industry for
consumers. 

  We feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to build something
as meaningful and special as Aereo. With so many shifts and advances in
technology, there has never been a more perfect time to take risks,
challenge the status quo and build something special. 

  Thank you for all of your support. Your emails, tweets, Facebook posts
and letters have meant the world to us. We are incredibly grateful to have
gone on this journey together. 

   Yours truly,
  =3D=3D=3D Chet Kanojia =3D=3D=3D
