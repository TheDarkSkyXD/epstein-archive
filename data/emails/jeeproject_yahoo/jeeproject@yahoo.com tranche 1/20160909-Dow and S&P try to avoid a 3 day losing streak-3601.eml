There's one economic report on the Friday calendar. The government releases wholesale inventories for July 10 a.m. ET, withforecasts calling for a 0.1 percent increase following a 0.3 percent rise in June. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren speaks at 7:45 a.m. ET, while Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan speaks at 9:30 a.m. ET and 8:15 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo will be on CNBC at 10 a.m. ET. Supermarket Kroger (KR), homebuilder Hovnanian (HOV), and retailer Mattress Firm (MFRM) are on the short earnings list this morning. There are no major companies reporting quarterly results after the bell. The NYSE implements changes to its opening procedures on Monday, hoping to speed up trading and efficiency, even on volatile days. The new rules were sought following the flash crash
 in August 2015, when the Dow dropped 1,000 points in a ten-minute period.
