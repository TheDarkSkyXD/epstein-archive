Nvidia (NVDA) reported quarterly profit of 79 cents per share, 13 cents above estimates, and the graphics chip maker's revenue was above forecasts as well.

<g class="gr_ gr_72 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="72" data-gr-id="72">adjusted</g> profit of $9.88 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates of $8.89, with revenue for the online travel company very slightly below forecasts. Wall Street is also focusing on weaker than expected current quarter earnings guidance.<br /> <br />TripAdvisor (TRIP) missed estimates by 2 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 24 cents per share, and the travel review website operator's revenue also fell below forecasts even though it saw a nearly 6 percent increase in click-based ad revenue. However, TripAdvisor also said it is seeing a recovery in per user revenue.<br /> 
<br />Electronic Arts (EA) came in 10 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 85 cents per share, while the video game maker's revenue was in line with forecasts. EA saw particularly strong results for digital game downloads, which have higher profit margins. Separately, the company approved a $1.2 billion stock buyback.<br /> <br />Nvidia (NVDA) reported quarterly profit of 79 cents per share, 13 cents above estimates, and the graphics chip maker's revenue was above forecasts as well. Nvidia saw strong demand for its flagship chip products, and also benefited from its diversification into the artificial intelligence and autonomous driving markets.<br />
<br />News Corporation (NWSA) reported adjusted quarterly profit of seven cents per share, two cents above estimates, while the Wall Street Journal publisher saw revenue beat estimates as well. The results were boosted by digital subscriber growth at the Journal, among other factors.</div><hr style='color:lightgrey;color: #efefef;background-color: #efefef;height: 1px; border:0; margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;'>
