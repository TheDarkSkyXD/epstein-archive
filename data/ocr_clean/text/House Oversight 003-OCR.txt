Those stats are a little worse than the comparable numbers for the full sample but don't indicate that a bond yield spike is definitively negative for equities.

Digging a little deeper shows that the underlying dynamics in the bond market matter. Essentially rising inflation breakevens is the key driver for equities. Even when real yields are rising it is the change in implied inflation that has correlated most strongly with equity returns in recent years. Looking at 4-week rolling returns since 2009, in the periods that real yields rose Stoxx 600 returns were a median +1.7% if breakevens were also higher at the same time. In contrast a combination of higher real yields and lower inflation breakevens led to a median -0.7% return.

What then is the prospect for inflation expectations from here? Breakevens have moved significantly already in the context of the Euro area inflation outlook. 5-year, 5-year forward inflation swaps have recovered all the ground they lost earlier in 2016 in Europe and are back to end 2014 levels in the US. At 1.6% in Europe and 2.44% in US there is arguably more limited upside. A return to the range for inflation expectations that prevailed in 2013/14 before the oil price collapse would imply another 30-50bp from here. However, at least in the case of Europe our economists see the outlook for inflation remaining very subdued. Overall we would conclude that equities can see upside from here if bond yields rise towards our fixed income team's targets as long as inflation expectations are stable to rising at the same time. Rising bond yields pushing Italian spreads wider a risk for equities. Although rising core rates are not necessarily problematic for stocks, an important caveat is the fall out in other parts of the bond markets - particularly in the periphery. The equity market in Europe is sensitive to rising Italian bond spreads - exhibiting a negative correlation in recent years. This is an important risk at the current juncture given the upcoming referendum in Italy and ECB decision on QE extension. Should Italian bond spreads widen significantly from here it would likely weigh on equity valuations, keeping the risk premium high in Europe and in turn offset or outweigh the benefit from rising nominal growth expectations globally. This is perhaps the biggest potential problem for equities in the scenario that bond yields rise further from here. The ECB decision on QE extension is an important risk event in that context. As our economists have discussed in a recent note the risks of an ECB delay in the short term are increasing but their base case remains a QE extension with some tweaks of the capital key - a relatively benign outcome for peripheral sovereigns.

Sector Strategy Markets due a period of consolidation in the short term. The reflation trade has run hard and we've taken some chips off the table in recent weeks by cutting our overweight positions in Banks and Basic Resources to neutral and reducing the size of our underweights in some Defensive sectors. In the short term we look for markets to consolidate. Near term risk reward is also a little poorer in light of event risks around the Italian referendum, OPEC's decision on a potential cut in oil production quotas and the ECB's decision on QE extension. Look for another leg to the reflation trade in the coming months. We would look for another leg to the cyclical and reflation rotation in the next 1-2 quarters as evidence of stronger global growth and rising inflation materializes. We will look to re-enter sector positions that benefit from global rotation when short term risk reward improves. However, we would look for the pace of the rotation to moderate and become less binary from here. The upside from here for bond yields is more limited. With that in mind we are likely to be more selective in reflation vs bond proxy positions. Politics likely remains an overhang through 1H 2017. Another reason to run a less binary portfolio over the coming months is the potential for political uncertainty to weigh on European markets. Attention near-term will focus on Italy but the French Presidential elections loom in April / May and the tail risk of a Marine Le Pen victory will act as an overhang for Europe in the coming months. It suggests 22017 may well be a year similar to 2016, in which the major indices in Europe have traded in ranges for large parts of the year. Value in some Defensive bond proxies. Valuation looks quite compelling already in some of the bond proxy sectors. Utilities and Healthcare are both trading at the low end of relative valuation ranges and have decent fundamentals in the view of our analyst team. However, rising government bond yields remains the major potential headwind in coming months. We are overweight both sectors. Financials - neutral following the strong recent rally. Banks have re-rated aggressively, taking PE-relative back to average levels. However, the sector continues to have uncertain prospects for EPS recovery given continued ultra-low policy rates in Europe and ongoing tail risks from periphery are an overhang on the sector. Continued long only positioning remains a potential support for the sector should rates and yield curves renew their widening moves. A Risk reward may be better in Insurance - the sector still offers the second highest DY in the market (and relative DY is still at 90th percentile of the range since 2004). Global quality Cyclicals - waiting for an entry point. Many cyclicals have performed less strongly in the recent rally than Resources and re-rated less aggressively than inancials. With relative PE valuations in-line with or below 17-year averages for th kes of Industrials, Chemicals and Technology we will look for opportunities to buil positions in cyclical areas in the coming months. Overowned positioning has been something of a negative for several of these areas (notably Tech) and any signs of a correction could be a catalyst to re-enter an overweight in the sector. Media - raise to overweight. With the outlook for markets set to become less binary we will look to add exposure to quality cyclical areas. One such sector that has lagged this year is Media, making this an interesting entry point. The sector is something of hybrid combining defensive and cyclical components and high and low quality. Media in particular has come back a long way following a six-month period of sustained underperformance. Overweight Oil position dependent on OPEC. As we go to press, the OPEC decision n a deal to cut oil supplies is pending. Our commodity strategists' base case has bee or some kind of deal, with upside into the mid $50s for a deal to cut 1 million barrels per day. However, in the case OPEC fails to agree any deal they see WTI dipping back 20 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 ankof America? Merrill Lync HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014479

below $40. In other words, the outcome is highly binary in the short term for crude and related equities. We flag to investors that we would consider reducing our weighting in the event of no deal. Assuming OPEC does cut production and oil prices recover up to the high $50s per barrel, as per our commodity strategists views, earnings and cash flows can recover significantly in the coming 12-18 months. Our Oil analysts model between 8 and 17% upside to operating cash flows in 2017 for European integrated stocks if assumed crude prices are increased $10 from $50 to $60. That makes the highest DY in market at -6% more sustainable out of FCF coverage. Cautious UK domestic (underweight Retail, Travel & Leisure). We are cautious on domestic UK exposure and underweight Retail and Travel & Leisure. To our mind, these companies face a lose-lose trade-off of maintaining margins by passing on higher costs at the expense of volumes, or face margin pressure by absorbing these costs in order to sustain current volumes. Building inflationary pressures point to a post-Christmas consumer squeeze. This could be further compounded OPEC cuts and oil prices rise. The Retail sector is also facing structural margin pressures and unattractive valuations. In Travel & Leisure (two thirds UK listed), profitability is declining from peak levels. Note our analysts also see structural pressures on airlines from overcapacity and competition. See below for more details.

That was in response to the signals from our technical models all flashing warning signs that the rotation out of bond proxies into reflation beneficiaries had got very stretched tactically. Our Composite Technical Indicators (CTIs) for sector relative performance hit +100 at the recent high in the case of Basic Resources and +94 for Banks and Insurance. These models combine a range of technical indicators including RSIs, MACDS, Bollinger bands and others and +100 represents maximum overbought. Basic Resources relative price has also reached +2.7SD above the 52-week average, the highest reading for the sector since 2010. Financials hit + 1SD while other cyclicals have also peaked at +1.5-2SD in recent weeks. By contrast bonds and equity bond proxies screen as very oversold on these models. All Defensives troughed at -92 or below at some point over the last 4 weeks. On Bollinger scores, relative prices hit between -2.4SD and -3.8SD for the Defensives and also Real Estate. In the case of Utilities (-3.8SD) that is close to a record low. Similarly our CTI readings for macro variables like 10-year Treasury yields, gold and $/yen also hit oversold levels.

recent price action for individual assets. However, the fact that we have had multiple signals across a range of sectors and macro prices is typically a warning that markets have moved too far too fast in a more general sense. The last comparable episode was in early July in the wake of the Brexit sell-off. At that point Defensives were hitting record over bought signals with Financials and Cyclicals seeing the opposite. Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty over the effects of Brexit the models provided a great signal to fade the violent rotation. With these signals in mind we look for a period of consolidation in the rotation trade. The models are short term in nature and are not intended to identify strategic turning points - although like in the case of Brexit they do tend to emphasize when a crescendo is reached. While we would look for another potential leg in some of the reflation trades over the coming months we would prefer to wait for a pull back. The Basic Resources sector provides a useful example in how to use the models tactically. Three times this year prior to the current instance the sector has hit overbought levels on its relative CTI indicator. Previous pullbacks lasted 4-8 weeks and averaged -11% in relative performance terms.

Rotation trade - valuations have moved a long way While technical metrics suggest a pause is due in the reflation rotation, we have also seen a significant amount of ground covered from a valuation perspective in the market moves to date. The scatter chart below compares the PE relative change since 8th July (the post Brexit valuation high / low for many sectors) against where PE relative ranks now compared to history. Essentially sectors in the top right have enjoyed a relative multiple re-rating and current relative PE levels are above the median since 1999. Those in the bottom left have seen relative PE multiples de-rate while their current relative PE is below the median since 1999. We make the following observations: Financials have had the biggest re-rating. Financials re-rated most since Brexit and are now trading around median relative valuation levels. Given the tight link between relative valuations and bond yields in recent years the PE- relatives for Banks and Insurance have also recovered much more than would seem justified by the move in the German 10-year yield. The sectors do screen cheaper versus history on PBV reflecting relatively depressed ROEs especially for Banks. Hence, we think PE multiple expansion from here would need to be driven by improving EPS prospects in the sector - something our analysts are sceptical about. • Global Cyclicals trading near or below average relative PE's. Many global cyclicals have had fairly modest re-ratings since early July and trade on close to median or below valuations. Sectors such as Industrials, Chemicals, Autos, Tech have relative PE multiples 5-10% higher than post Brexit. Relative PE for Chemicals and Industrials are close to post 1999 averages. Construction PE relative does screen as elevated - at the 92°d percentile. Autos, Tech and Travel & Leisure all have PE relatives in the bottom quartile of their post 1999 range. Relative PE valuations look very reasonable on this basis for Tech, Chemicals and even industrials. In part this may reflect higher than historical average ROE - relative PBV is less flattering for Industrials for example. Resources sectors - de-rating as EPS recovers. Oil and Basic Resources PE relative has declined more than in any other sector. Although both sectors have seen strong price performance this year, PE multiples are declining from very elevated levels earlier this year as earnings bounce back from depressed levels. Since the end of June Basics 12m forward EPS is up +65%, while the sector index price has risen +33%. For Basics and Oil, performance from here is likely to remain a function of EPS momentum rather than valuations. • Defensives have all de-rated with Telecoms suffering least. Defensive sectors have all seen relative valuations decline over the past four months. Healthcare and Utilities are the two sectors with multiples at lower end of the historical range - notably Healthcare at the 14" percentile. Utilities relative PE is also close to the prior low hit in 2013. Telecoms screens as somewhat less depressed form a valuation perspective - notwithstanding the poor sector performance in 2016. PE relative remains well above the median levels since 1999. • Staples approaching 2010/14 lows on PE-relative. Staples have also de- rated severely - in fact Food & Beverage relative PE fell somewhat more than the other Defensives. However, current levels are still somewhat higher versus the historical range (since 1999) than for Healthcare or Utilities. That being said, the PE-relative rose structurally through the 2000s. Over a shorter time frame since 2010 Food & Beverage is also now trading near the bottom quartile. PE-relative is 6-10% above the lows seen in 2010 and 2014 - but those would still allow for healthy 25-30% valuation premiums to the market. Bankof America Merrill Lynch European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 23 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014482

Overall, we find it hard to argue that sectors haven't moved a long way already from a valuation perspective, even against the context of potentially important inflection points in bond yields and earnings. From here we suspect investors may need to more selective in how they play the rotation theme and consider other variables such as earnings momentum, yield, technicals and positioning when allocating across sectors.

Although we saw a severe risk-off move immediately following the Brexit vote, the only truly significant post-Brexit delta has been a weaker GBP. GBP is down 16% vs USD and 11% on a trade weighted basis. In fact, a simple post-Brexit strategy of going equal weighted long UK-listed sectors with above market international sales exposure vs sectors with below market sales exposure would have delivered - 110% returns in USD.

As we outline below, we think it is just a matter of timing. The political certainty created by the swift election of Theresa May plus the Bank of England's interventions have delayed, rather than resolved, the underlying uncertainties caused by the vote.

Falling growth to compound deficit problems Real gdp is only expected to fall 0.1% in 2016 vs the March forecast. But the UK Office of Budgetary Responsibility expects growth to slip by 0.8% next year (2.2% to 1.4%) and 0.4% on 2018 (2.1% to 1.7%) vs March. A notable slice of this is can be attributed to the OBR's estimate that Brexit added £59bn to UK borrowing to 2022, or nearly £200mn a week. These numbers include Phillip Hammond's sensible but small measures. Our UK economist is more pessimistic forecasting 0.9% in 2017 and 0.7% in 2018. Even if we split the two, that represents a 50% decline in expected 2017 gdp and 40% decline in 2018. The OBR also expects public sector net debt to hit its highest level since 1964-65 in 2017-18 at a time when the UK already relies on "the kindness of strangers" to finance its growing twin deficit. 26 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 Bankof America?

We think they could be disappointed. Firstly, the Government has committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March 2017. We think this is likely irrespective of the outcome of the Judicial Review on where the legislative power lies for making that decision. Second, the Government's formal position is not to announce its negotiating strategy in public. A lack of insight into the UK's future trading relationship with its biggest export market for goods and services is a difficult backdrop upon which to continue investing in the UK, even if a few companies have taken that decision already. Third, we think there will have to be a resolution to the trade-off between the Government's desire to control immigration and reach a beneficial economic settlement. The problem, as is often repeated by EU leaders, is that curbing migration puts the UK on a collision course with the EU's four freedoms and therefore at odds with access to the single market. That's why our base case remains a so called "hard Brexit", but even now our colleagues in EX strategy think investors are not positioned for this. Hence their GBP/USD forecast of 1.15 for Q1/Q2 2017. Finally, a major concern for investors and especially business investment would be if the UK faces a "cliff edge" for trade terms in 2019 (on the assumption article 50 is triggered). While a transition deal would be a potential positive development next year, the absence of such a deal before or soon after article 50 is triggered could be another reason for policy uncertainty to spike higher again.

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, ONS, Bloomberg To understand this delay it is worth remembering "Marmitegate" and the pressure put on companies not to raise the prices of household brands. The incident also illustrates the margin pressure building up in the system and challenges posed to producers, vendors and consumers as to who will absorb the higher costs. According to the Chairman of the UK Food and Drink Federation many companies may be waiting until bost-Christmas to change prices, which lan Wright estimates could rise as much as 8% If that happens at the same time as power prices hit seasonal highs, the consumer could start to feel the pinch. To avoid this leading to a contraction in demand, workers we would need to see strong ominal wage growth. However, the Institute of Fiscal Studies does not expect real vages to return to 2008 levels until 2021. The tightness of the UK labour market coul also cushion any blow, but we note jobless claims have started to rise again and businesses may be less likely to hire if uncertainty, for reasons outlined above, picks up again. 28 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 Chart 61: Food prices are key to watch 14 12 10 8 4 2 -2 -4 -6 CPI food prices, BAML forecast, % yoy - Food input prices, % yoy, lagged 3- months (rhs) 40 30 20 10 0 7- -10 -20 1999 2011 2013 88 Food input prices calculated as an average of domestically produced and imported food.

Given all of the above, we reiterate our preference for avoiding sectors with a high proportion of domestic UK companies. To our mind, these companies face a lose-lose trade-off of maintaining margins by passing on higher costs at the expense of volumes, or face margin pressure by absorbing these costs in order to sustain current volumes in our view. This could be further compounded if our Oil Strategists' forecasts are right and Brent averages - $60/bb following an OPEC cut. But how much is in the price? The pushback to our view is that the forecasted deterioration in growth hasn't really materialised and investors are already pricing it in a lot of bad news. For instance, Easyjet is down nearly 35% and investors are still underweight the UK in the FMS. While this is the case for certain stocks, at a sector level investors appear to have squared off their underweights in Retail/ Travel according to the FMS.

Underweight Retail In addition to Brexit concerns, we also see a number of fundamental reasons to reiterate out underperform on Retail. • Structural margin pressures: Aside from Brexit, retailers face declining returns as online disruptors and discounters drive up competition. EBITDA margins have fallen from 8% in 2010 to close to 7% in 2016 and RoE has declined by nearly 3% since 2004. We think this structural trend has further to run. • Valuations are also unattractive. Retail remains on a significant premium to the market on absolute terms (17.3x 2017 PE vs 14.2x) and is expensive versus its own history at 20% above its 10y relative average on PE and 92%ile on PBV, while it has the second lowest dividend in the market (2.9%). Even if you strip H&M and Inditex the sector is towards the higher range of its post-GFC range. UK supermarkets have had their relief rally. Despite challenges facing UK food retailers, Tesco has rallied 25% and Morrison's 15% since Brexit as retail spending has held up and the short base grew massively immediately following the UK-EU vote. Yet as Xavier Le Mene notes, this has largely been because they have gained market share from Asda and investors have bought into their new management plans. However, Xavier see limited upside potential for either next year and there is a risk that Asda starts to recoup lost ground under its new management too.

Underweight Travel & Leisure • Airlines in structural decline: our European Airlines analyst thinks overcapacity (networks set to grow 7% yoy to 2020) and competition from low cost/ ME carriers is driving prices and passenger yields lower across the board. Negatively correlated to Oil: the sector is negatively correlated to the Oil price and despite recent weakness, our Commodity Strategist expects OPEC to cut by 500k b/d or 1 million b/d. Should OPEC cut with firm quotas and a tight control mechanism, they see WTI prices averaging $59/bbl. • Watch UK consumer confidence closely: the combined effect of the challenges we identified earlier starting to mount for the UK consumer and the drop in the value of the pound could reduce demand for and expenditure on overseas holidays. This would weigh on the travel operator part of the sector. If the bulk of sterling move is over the boost for dollar earnings like Compass will also likely fade. • Peak returns: unlike Retail, T&L margins (98%ile since 2004) and RoEs (85%ile) are close to all-time highs. We think returns may well have peaked therefore given the backdrop of rising oil, weakening consumer confidence in the UK and structural overcapacity in airlines. This is reflected in the fact that PBV are on 2.8x for the sector, which is top quintile for the sector since 2004.

The fundamental bull case for Health rests on the strong pipeline of new products for the big cap pharma universe. Our sector analysts forecast EU Pharma to deliver a 2018-21E EPS CAR of 11%, up from mid-single digit levels in recent years. Historically that would justify a PE re-rating and a multiple for the pharma sub-sector nearer 17-18x than the current 13x 2018 PE. We believe the Republican clean sweep in the US elections represents a positive catalyst as it significantly decreases the potential for legislative initiatives to aggressively control drug pricing in the US. The catalyst for the sector to re-rate will come progressively from newsflow around new products. The next 12 months should see progress on this front with several of the European large caps expected to announce key data on important drugs in 2017.

The sector is the biggest direct beneficiary of corporate QE in the UK and Euro are (more than half of the sector are eligible for the EC's Corporate Sector Purchase Program) meaning it can gain more than most other sectors from potential refinancing savings. This cushions any effect on debt costs from higher bond yields as corporate bond yields are still very Earnings and cash flow are improving.

Disclosures Important Disclosures FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst's assessment of a stock's: (i) absolute total return potential and (i) attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12 month total return expectation for a stock and the firm's guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst's view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation). Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster* Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70% Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30% Underperform N/A ≥ 20% * Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster. INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock's coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.

2 The Virgin Islands Daily News VIRGIN ISLANDS Tuesday, December 13, 2016 V.l. businesses face higher unemployment taxes as territory struggles to pay down $69 million debt By BRIAN O'CONNOR Insurance's Division of Fiscal and the automatic increase based on a Daily News Staff Actuarial Services in the Department - 66 negative account, and lowered the of Labor. minimum rate to 0. Less money came Territory business owners will pay four times the normal federal unem- ployment tax rate this year because of an unpaid government debt, docu- ments show. The federal unemployment insur- ance tax rate is traditionally 6 per- cent on the first $7,000 an employee makes. However, the federal govern- ment usually offers a credit of 5.4 percent, meaning most employers ac- tually pay about 0.6 percent, accord- ing to the IRS. States and territories - with unemployment insurance programs meeting federal standards are re- quired to meet their unemployment obligations. When a state can't meet its unemployment obligations, it's entitled to take loans from the Fed- eral Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. Federal documents show only one state and one jurisdiction Califor- nia and the U.S. Virgin Islands are currently in that position. The territory owes $69,138,266.61 in loans, according to the U.S. De- partment of Treasury website. In fiscal year 2017, which be- gan Oct. 1, the loans have accrued $294,349.15 in interest payments alone. The V.I. Labor Department is in charge of administering unemploy- ment insurance. Labor Commission- er Catherine Hendry did not return a number of phone calls seeking com- ment. Government House spokeswoman Cherie Munchez would not com- ment, saying that Hendry would issue a prepared statement about the debt by Wednesday. Provisions of the Federal Unem- ployment Tax Act stipulate that in states or territories with outstanding balances in the fund, businesses are subject to a credit reduction, which is collected and directed toward the un- paid balance, according to Robert Pa- vosevich, Supervisor of the Actuarial Team in the Office of Unemployment Virgin Islands business owners Will pay the original 0.6 percent, plus an additional 1.8 percent caused by the unpaid balance, for a total of 2.4 percent, Pavosevich said. At the fully discounted rate, an I don't think there's enough political willpower to do the kinds of thing necessary to fix the system. - Charles Engeman, an attorney who served on the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council under the administration of Gov. John deJongh Jr. in, even as unemployment rates re- mained high and benefits remained expensive. A few steps could help move the system back to sound footing, Engeman said. For example, better employer would pay $42 for each employee earning $7,000. At the Vir- unem- gin Islands rate, employers will have to pay $168. After two years with an unpaid 66. balance, the discount decreases by 0.3 percent each year until the total discount disappears, Pavosevich said. "It's capped at 6 percent," Pavosev- ich said. At the full 6 percent, employers will have to pay $420 for each new employee earning $7,000 that comes on board. By law, that money can't The business owners always bear the brunt of whatever deficiencies we have. We have to, at some point, find other sources of revenue for the government.

John deJongh Jr. Without payment on the loan - or waivers or relief, which has happened three times since 2013 • the rate is scheduled to max out by 2028. That's barring the imposition of step in- creases, which can happen if the state has an outstanding balance for a cer- tain number of years, or if - as was the case in the tax year 2012 - step increases are piled on by other provi- sions of the law, which could move the unemployment tax rate up faster. "It looks like they're not making much headway," Pavosevich said, re- ferring to the territory's debt. The territory wasn't alone in 2011, the first year the rate went up. In all, 20 states and the Virgin Islands re- ceived a 0.3 percent credit reduction that year, federal documents show. That's in part because of the linger- ing effects of the Great Recession, said Bennett Chan, a lawyer who represents several businesses and has worked with the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce in the past. In general terms, states collected more money than they paid out dur- ing the years leading up to the 2008 market collapse, creating large sur- pluses. Sometimes those surpluses were subject to financial raids. Other times - as was the case in the ter- ritory the surpluses were used as a cause to reduce the amounts col- lected for unemployment insurance. When large-scale unemployment hit as a result of the recession, surpluses turned into deficits. Chan said. "A lot of states were blindsided by the Great Recession," Chan said. "They also had big surpluses and never foresaw that there would be this sudden inflow in unemployment claims." Territorial officials were late in re- acting to bring the rate back up to ad- dress the issue, Chan said. "If we had done it earlier, we prob- ably would have collected enough," he said. "Now they want to make it up when times are hard." In many cases, the government can't say what each employer owes or has paid in surplus, Engeman said. The system originally was set up so that employers faced a roller coaster, Engeman said. Each employer had a rate based on a three-year average. If an em- ployer's account paid out more in benefits than they contributed, the rate would go up to 5.4 percent. After three years, the employer's rate would drop down to 0.1 percent, because at 5.4 percent, the rate exceeded likely ContribuTions At 0.1 percent, if anyone were laid off, it immediately moved the em- ployer back to the 5.4 percent rate. Employers would oscillate between the 5.4 percent rate and the 0.1 per- cent rate. "It was 5.4 for many employers, and that's what an average employer would pay out over the course of 17 years for one employee," Engeman said. As a result, the unemployment insurance fund accumulated large surpluses. To reduce the surpluses, the V.I. Labor Department dropped reducing the amount of time the unemployed are eligible for unem- ployment would both help. Verify- ing that those collecting unemploy- ment are seeking employment, and generally reducing fraud also would help, Engeman said. "I don't think there's enough politi- cal willpower to do the kinds of thing necessary to fix the system," he said. Chamber of Commerce officials on both islands decried any increase in taxes or fees for businesses. "Despite what the governor and the senators think, the economy of the Virgin Islands is not doing that well," said Tom Brunt III, a member of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors. Kimberly McCollum, president of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce, said any increases to fees or taxes was worrying. "The business owners always bear the brunt of whatever deficiencies we have," she said. "We have to, at some point, find other sources of revenue for the government. Any time there's any sort of additional tax burden, fee burden, licensing burden, it's always a point of concern." The folly of the situation is com- pounded by the fact that business owners themselves aren't allowed to file for unemployment if they lose their jobs, McCollum said "You're still paying unemployment taxes on what you're paid, but you are not allowed to request compensation should you find vourself in a position to file for unemplovment." she said Contact Brian O'Connor at 340-714-9130 or email boconnor@ dailynews.vi.

"I'm not intent on messing up our communities," said Caproni, whose company picks up the bin sites on St. John. "We've created a dialogue. I am a fair person, " Caproni said.

The Waste Management Authority noted that it was "unable to identify a revenue source" to pay Gem's for the years-old debt. During testimony on the Fiscal Year 2017 budget, Waste Manage- ment again listed $200,000 owed to Gem's Construction for garbage collection on St. Thomas. However, Waste Management officials said the $200,000 was owed from the 2011 fiscal year. No one from Gem's Construction was available for comment Monday afternoon. Merritt said he believes the Waste Management Authority can address the overdue debt owed to the vendors. "I think we can. We've got to get a plan in hand and get them paid. If they provide a service, they should get paid," he said. Contact Jonathan Austin at 340-714-9104 or email jaustin@ dailynews.vi.

In one such complaint, Harrison alleges Deputy Commissioner Curtis Griffin Jr. was "receiving compensa- tion when absence from employment without proper leave documentation," and "payroll fraud/embezzlement - falsifying timekeeping records, or when employees are not working while on the job." In a letter attached to the claim, Harrison says that from August 2016 to the present, Griffin received com- pensation while not reporting for duty at the department. "In addition, he has not left for- warding contact information to those under his supervision and often was not available during contact attempts occurring during normal working hours," Harrison wrote. "Griffin was available only via VIPD email which was delayed or not deliverable, thus leaving him ineffective and not suit- able to be classified as working tele- commuting. Griffin dismissed the complaints against him, and said he welcomed an investigation. "I want them to investigate be- cause I'm hoping • when all is done - I'm hoping that maybe I can sue her for slander," he said. "I have noth- ing to hide." Harrison's letter calls for Griffin to be investigated. "While his explanation of absence has been reported as a long term med- ical procedure, due to the extraordi- nary length of absence, previous ab- sences, and non-contact information, a full investigation is warranted to in- sure the people of the Virgin Islands have not been deprived of its funds due to improper payroll deductions or notifications," she wrote. The complaint was one of 10 filed after Harrison lost her job as direc- tor of the police department's Train- ing Bureau, according to copies fur- nished by Harrison. She filed a citizen's complaint after her termination alleging that Police Commissioner Delroy Richards Sr. had violated department policy and that he had ignored requests for the correction of a violation. Harrison also filed a complaint alleging Griffin's administrative as- sistant, Le-Reeda Lake, was absent on sick leave for four weeks without prior notice; that special assistant to the commissioner Capt. Mary Dug- gan had potentially disclosed confi- dential department information to a third-party vendor for personal gain, and had used threatening behavior to create a hostile work environment, and that she had obstructed Harri- son's performance of her duties. Harrison further alleged that Lt. Maria Colon-Jones had disrupted a training presentation, and she said her termination was retaliatory for asking for sick leave to be treated for Zika. Harrison said that she eventually fled the Virgin Islands in fear of her life and that the police department still owes her $5,000 in back pay, Harrison said. Harrison said Monday she's sub- mitted her complaints to Gov. Ken- neth Mapp. "I was the director of training and was fired without cause," she said. "I had filed several complaints." Harrison said she requested 10 days of medical treatment off-island to com- bat a Zika infection on Oct. 18. "Two hours later, I was terminat- ed," she said. Documents provided by Harrison show she was suspended without pay on Oct. 18, and terminated on Oct. 28. Griffin said that while he was un- dergoing cardio rehab in Florida, he started hearing about issues involving Harrison. Ultimately, Richards made the decision to terminate Harrison, Griffin said. "Subsequent to her termination, she started sending complaints," he said. "She said she heard that while I was away I was practicing law and not really sick." Harrison wasn't his supervisor, and wasn't aware of how the accumu- lated sick time was being used, Grif- fin said. "She submitted so many com- plaints against so many people," he said. "It's obvious that it's frivolous." The complaints have not yet re- sulted in an internal investigation, Richards said. "I found she was too much of a distraction for us to move forward with the actions as required of us by the mandates of our consent decree, Richards said about his decision to terminate Harrison. Harrison had failed to submit to a department background check in a timely manner, Richards said. "The department brought her in on an interim basis initially, and then she was asked to comply with the package that we provided in order to conduct a background investigation," he said. "She offered resistance. She believed she could complete her own timeline." Harrison said she had asked for 10 days to secure her college transcripts. "My email specifically says I am not saying I don't want a background check," she said. Richards said he ultimately direct- ed Harrison's complaints to the legal department, but he said Harrison continued to send letters and emails. A response from the department's legal counsel provided by Harrison says simply that Harrison couldn't use the citizen's complaint process to complain about things that happened while she was the director of the Training Bureau, and that each com- plaint will be closed as it is received. "In some of her letters and emails. she appeared very threatening" Richards said. "In one of her emails she wrote 'You are sicker than a tree branch that's going to be cut down very soon." It's one ignorance after another." Harrison disputes that charac- terization. "I'm very professional," she said. Griffin was on legitimate sick leave when he was in Florida, Richards said. "He was being treated and he en- tered into a program in Florida," he said. "The woman is on a witch hunt all over." Contact Brian O'Connor at 340-714-9130 or email boconnor@ dailynews.vi.

Federal judges from Philadelphia in the Virgin Islands to hear cases By BRIAN O'CONNOR Daily News Staff tate battle over an inheritance in which two separate federal cases were merged into one. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Ap- peals will sit this week in the federal courthouse on St. Thomas. Judges Kent Jordan, Michael Cha- gares and Thomas Hardiman will hear a range of appellate cases, ranging from a local prisoner challenging his detention as unconstitutional to an es- The judges fly in from Philadelphia to hear argument on issues they decide at a later date. Appellate court argument is based around rapid-fire questions from the empaneled judges, unlike civil or criminal court, which frequently is dominated by long exchanges between attorneys and witnesses. The appellant attorney gets four min- utes to make a case, followed by four minutes from the appellee, followed by four minutes of rebuttal from the appel- lant attorney, though judges' questions can sometimes turn four minutes into eight. For example, Ronald Gillette, incar- cerated in 2008 on multiple counts of aggravated rape and unlawful sexual Since 1985 NATURAL FOOD Grocery & Deli Great Deli Veggie Burgers • Vegan Soups • Salads • Spinach Lasagna Broccoli Quiche • Daily Vegan Platter • Organic Carrot Juice Wheat Grass Juice • Huge Deli Sandwiches 2016 Get Order To Go: (340) 775-3737 Mandela Circle St. Thomas Why buy your vehicle from STRAKER MOTORSP..... • Friendly and honest sales staff • No high pressure sales tactics • Huge inventory of extra clean pre-owned vehicles • The most popular makes and models of Cars, SUV's, Trucks • On the spot financing makes buying easy • Locally owned and operated • FREE SHIPPING TO ST. THOMAS contact against two children, is seeking an appeal on a motion denying his re- lease from custody. Gillette's attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo Ill, began on Monday by making his case that the motion, ordered by Chief District Court Judge Wilma Lewis, constituted a final judgement and thus was worthy of an appeal. DiRuzzo sought a three-judge panel to overturn Lewis's order. It didn't take long for Jordan to ask a question. "How can it be a final order if there are still claims in the case, if you're still seeking relief, which you are?" he said. DiRuzzo had a response. "The denial of a three-judge panel effectively throws Mr. Gillette out of court," he said. He started to add to this, but Jordan cut him off. "There are claims for relief, they still exist," he said. "I'm struggling to see how this is a final judgement." Orders relating to the change in the reduction of a prison population essentially rely on three-judge pan- els to be valid, DiRuzzo said. Pris- on orders issued by a single judge are subject to challenge on appeal, DiRuzzo said. "I would submit that three-judge courts are desirable in confrontations between state and federal power," he said. Kimberly Salisbury was the Assis- tant Attorney General arguing for the appellee. Her job on Monday was to tell three federal judges that it wasn't their job to decide Gillette's case. "This particular order is just simply not final," she said, at one point. However, Hardiman had a question. If there was an order short of Gil- lette's release that could make the prison resolve the Eighth Amendment violations that put the prison under a federal consent decree for decades to resolve, Lewis or another judge could still make the determination. The pris- on has completed only 14 percent of the new consent decree ordered in 2013 according to testimony. "What would that order look like?" Hardiman asked. Salisbury struggled with an answer. Jordan tried to steer the argument back to the facts of the case. "Does the fact that a 2013 consent decree superseded and replaced the original, does it mean the three decades of prior noncompliance is to be ig nored?" he said. "You're not even a fifth of the way completed. At what point is enough enough?" Complying with the consent decree will take time, Salisbury said. "According to the Bureau of Correc- tions, we're not there yet," she said. Chagares jumped in, and compared Golden Grove Adult Correctional Fa- cility to a luxury cruise liner. "It's like your big cruise ships out in the bay," he said. "It takes a long time to turn around. But this is a really long time." Hearings will continue today before the Third Circuit at the DeLugo Federal Building on St. Thomas at 9 a.m. An- other session is set for Thursday start- ing at 10:30 a.m. Contact Brian O'Connor at 340-714-9130 or email boconnor@ dailvnews.vi.

6 The Virgin Islands Daily News VIRGIN ISLANDS Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Oswald Harris Court raid yields 2 marijuana arrests By SUZANNE CARLSON Daily News Staff ST. THOMAS — A massive op- eration involving more than a dozen armed local and federal officers while a helicopter circled overhead at Oswald Harris Court on Fri- day evening yielded two marijuana arrests. Jose Squiabro, 42, and Yasim Ross, 31, both of Oswald Harris Court, were arrested as a result of the opera- tion, according to court documents. Both were charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and released Monday after posting $10,000 bond each. Arraignment for the two men is scheduled for Jan. 5. Friday's operation shut down the housing community and caused alarm for residents around Estate Thomas, Long Bay and Centerline Road. More than a dozen armed officers secured the intersection around Build- ing 9 in the housing community as a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter flew overhead. None of the officers would say what they were do- ing, but they were dressed in tactical UDL LUMBER YARD Guala gear, some armed with long guns that appeared to be semi-automatic rifles, and officers wore body armor labeled as being from the Drug Enforcement Administration or police. Probable cause affidavits filed Monday against Squiabro and Ross shed light on the operation, known as "December Reign. The operation is a joint effort by officers from Homeland Security In- vestigations, U.S. Customs and Bor- der Patrol, the Bureau of Alcohol, To- bacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Jus- tice Department, and the V.I. Police Department. It is meant to patrol St. Thomas housing communities, "due to the recent increase in gun violence in those areas," according to the af- fidavit for Ross. At 4:45 p.m. Friday, officers ap- proached a group of men around Building 20 and noticed Squiabro drop a partially smoked joint, accord- ing to the affidavit. Officers recovered the joint and 105 bags containing marijuana, ac- cording to the affidavit. The affida- vit does not note how large the bags were or the total weight of marijuana RIDE VIEW SKYRIDE TO PARADISE POINT was "no known disposition" listed in court documents. Similar to Squiabro's arrest, at about 5:50 p.m. Friday, officers ap- proached Ross and other men near the Ist Stop Gas Station in Estate Thomas, which is located south of Oswald Harris Court. When asked whether he had any illegal substanc- es, Ross said, "yeah I have a little weed in my back pocket," according to the affidavit. Officers found a total of 2.2 ounces of marijuana packaged in various plas- tic bags in Ross' possession and arrest- ed him, according to the affidavit.

Tuesday, December 13, 2016 VIRGIN ISLANDS Prosecutors: white powder letters contained hoodoo curse By SUZANNE CARLSON Daily News Staff A woman facing federal criminal charges for mailing letters contain- ing white powder was attempting to place a hoodoo curse on her ene- mies, according to court documents filed by prosecutors in the case. Eugenia Winston, who is facing 32 counts of mailing threatening communications, placed "hotfoot powder into envelopes containing subpoenas that she mailed to wit- nesses set to testify against her in a civil lawsuit against her former employer, Scotiabank, according to court documents. Hoodoo, work," also known as "root- traditional African American folk spirituality that de- veloped from a number of West African spiritual traditions and be- liefs. The detail came in prosecutors opposition to Winston's motion to suppress all of her statements to au- thorities, which was filed Monday. Winston has been free on unse- cured bond since Sept. 1, and her civil lawsuit against Scotiabank al- leging employment discrimination and harassment has been placed on hold until the criminal case against her is resolved. At a detention hearing on Sept. 1, Federal prosecutor Chris Fisanick said Winston's actions were a clear threat intended to terrorize the re- cipients of the letters, and made ref- erence to the 2001 anthrax attacks. Postal Inspector Eric Oram said at the hearing that the substance was determined to be nontoxic and was likely baby powder, cornstarch, or a similar substance. Winston's attorney, Assistant Federal Public Defender Gabriel Villegas, argued that Winston is the victim of an unfortunate mis- understanding, and she accidentally spilled body powder over and into the envelopes. However, Monday's filing by federal prosecutors paints a slight- ly different picture of Winston's Hoodoo, also known as "rootwork," is a traditional African American folk spirituality that developed from a number of West African spiritual traditions and beliefs. actions. "Winston mailed over 30 en- velopes that contained 'hotfoot' powder and subpoenas to various individuals in the Virgin Islands. Hotfoot powder is a hoodoo curse designed to prevent witnesses from appearing in court to testify," ac- cording to the filing. "Hotfoot" powder is a hoodoo practice of mixing various ingre- dients often some combination of cayenne pepper, Sulphur, copper sulphate, cornstarch and other ele- ments - • which is believed to drive away enemies. Commercial ver- sions of the powder also are avail- able for sale online. Recipients of Winston's letters were mainly witnesses who might testify against Winston in her law- suit against Scotiabank, and also in- cluded U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruth Miller, the legal counsel for Scotia- bank and Winston's former counsel in her suit against Scotiabank, ac- cording to prosecutors. Because the envelopes had a return address of the U.S. Court- house on St. Thomas, "despite the fact that Winston was serving these subpoenas herself," some of the en- velopes that could not be delivered were returned to the courthouse and opened by staff there, according to prosecutors. "Believing the powder to be an- thrax or some other deadly biologi- cal toxin, the United States Court- house was evacuated and closed; the employees in the courthouse ho were exposed to the powder were quarantined for hours," ac- cording to the filing The incident caused significant lisruption at the courthouse and at le private law office of attorne ennett Chan near the West India Co. cruise ship dock. "The purpose of lacing these en- velopes with hotfoot powder was to instill fear and intimidation in the witnesses to prevent their testify- ing against Winston," according to prosecutors' filing. The filing does not indicate how authorities determined the sub- stance in the envelopes was hotfoot powder or what ingredients were in the powder. Winston admitted to FBI in- vestigators shortly after the enve- lopes were received that she was the sender. But Villegas has filed a motion to suppress all of her state- ments to law enforcement, saying she was not properly advised of her right to avoid self-incrimination. But prosecutors shot back in Monday's filing, saying there is no evidence in a video-recorded inter- view with Winston that authorities did not properly advise her of her rights or attempt to intimidate her to give a statement in any way. Villegas wrote in his motion that "the videotaped interview speaks for itself." However, prosecutors wrote that "the most cursory view of Winston's video recorded interview with law enforcement agents establishes be- yond cavil that Winston was never coerced, was properly and repeat- edly advised of her rights, and consciously waived those rights," according to Monday's filing. "The first thirty seconds of the interview wholly defeats Winston's meritless motion." ial onlan. il before U.S. Distric Judge Juan Sanchez.

10 The Virgin Islands Daily News Tuesday, December 13, 2016 CENTENNIAL SCENE Archaeology in the Virgin Islands Virgin Islands laborers excavate pre-historic deposits at Magens Bay, St. Thomas. Photo courtesy of THE VIRGIN ISLANDS OUR NEW POSSESSIONS The Cuban Scientific Expedition to the Virgin Islands in 1951 was documented by archaeologists Oswaldo I. Morales Patiño, above, and Fernando Royo Guardia, and subsequently translated and annotated many years later for the Virgin Islands Ar chaeological Society in its Journal number 5 (1978) by Alfredo E. Figueredo. Morales Patiño was president of the National Board of Archaeology and Ethnology within the Ministry of Culture and Education from 1951-1955. During that same period, Royo Guardia served first as secretary and then treasurer. The visiting Cuban scien- tists were part of a commission formed, among other objectives, to study and identify possible routes through which prehistoric cultures may have reached Cuba, to seek evidence of the presence of common Cuban influences in Jamaica, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and to ascertain the spread of Carib influence and identify the culture found by Colum- bus on St. Croix. Welcomed in the Virgin Islands by Gov. Morris de Castro, they visited and examined four sites. On St. Thomas, they judged the Magens Bay site to be Arawakan culture with a few Igneri specimens. Administrator Harry E. Taylor accompanied the visitors on St. Croix, where they viewed three more sites: Christiansted environs where they exam- ined and collected a number of rimsherds and shell samples; the Salt River midden, with its French fort earthworks foundation, where they were able to excavate pottery, stone, shell and shell bead specimens; and Estate Richmond, where they viewed artifacts, including some Igneri pottery, obtained by the owners from Salt River and from an Indian site on the estate. Ac- cording to Figueredo, the "importance of this work (by the Cubans) is not due solely to its reports of archaeological remains, however; it is also a historical document, offering us interesting information on the state of affairs, beliefs, and personalities of its time. The Cubans came during one of our minor dark ages — when archaeo- logical work had come to a near standstill, and the history and historiography of the (Virgin Islands) ... were in abject abandon" Kathryne Brooks Kay-Willock, archaeologist with the Conservation and Cultural Affairs Department, studies the remains of what is believed to be 1,000-year-old skeleton located at Hull Bay beach in 1974 in St. Thomas, at a proposed condominium project. The "ribbon-sealed" bottle, a P.F. Heering Company "Heering's Cherry Cordial" bottle produced in the period 1835-1850, was recovered from the harbor in St. Thomas, where many such items have been discarded over the centuries. The Schenectady (New York) Gazette of Jan. 7, 1981, reported an upcoming lecture presentation to the Na- tional Bottle Museum Society in Ballston Spa, N.Y., on the "Bur- ied Treasures of St. Thomas." The newspaper reported that lecturer Gary T. Stephenson "re- cently returned from the Virgin Islands where he provided con- sulting services to an individual who has unearthed over 3,000 bottles from an old community dump. The collection dates back to 1700. 'I have never seen so many bottles come out of one dig, said Stephenson, vice president of the museum society. Bottles in the collection come from Paris, London, Mar- tinique, Canada, Germany and the U.S.A. They graphically illus- trate the history of St. Thomas, showing evidence of worldwide trade and commerce. The St. Thomas collection is considered to be the fifth largest collection in the U.S." Photo courtesy / of VAGN PETERSEN'S DANISH BOTTLES HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014507

Tuesday, December 13, 2016 The Virgin Islands Daily News 11 CENTENNIAL SCENE Fort Salé Ancient Taino ceremonial ball court and plaza Columbus Landing Site November 14, 1493 Fort Salé (formerly Fort Flamand) at the entrance to Salt River in St. Croix is the oldest intact colonial earthwork fort under United States authority. It is also believed to be the only extant earthwork fort in the entire Caribbean. Begun circa 1640 by the English, it was occupied in turn by the Dutch, then the French. The fortifications lie directly adjacent to the Columbus landing site and an ancient Taino ceremonial ball court and plaza. All these features are part of the National Park System's Salt River Bay National Historic Park and Ecological Preserve, co-owned by and managed under an agree- ment with the government of the Virgin Islands. The Daily News of May 13, 1938, reported the 1934 discov- ery by Alvarez Julien of skeletal remains and pottery sherds on Water Island. Based upon the direct association of shells, stone implements and pottery in the area, Julien suspected the remains to be Carib Indian in origin. In 1936 he brought news of his find to the atten- tion of J.C. Trevor, who was conducting field work on the Negroes of the Eastern Carib- bean under his fellowship in anthropology at Northwestern University. The skeletal remains had been re-interred and while all could not be relocated, those that could were donated by Julien to Oxford University for further identification and study. Provisionally they were classified as pre-Columbian with further characteristics to be defined and confirmed. The images above and others appeared in the article "Skel- etal Remains from the Virgin Islands" in the April 1938 issue of "Man, A Monthly Record of Anthropological Science" pub- lished by the Royal Anthropo- logical Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (Vol. XXXVIII, 47-65). According to The Daily News, Virgin Islands "Governor Law- rence Cramer gave permission for the material to be excavated and sent to England" An old scale found on St. John and donated to Cruz Bay Museum on July 8, 1974, by Russel Dennem.

OPINIONS Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Where will Trump venture for his first state visit? Barbara Streisand and Lena Dun- ham may be some of the higher profile Trumpfugees leaving the country and heading to Justin Trudeau's Canada. What is less certain is if a President Donald Trump will make Ottawa his first foreign port of call a long- standing presidential and foreign policy tradition. Post-election, Trudeau quickly called to congratulate PEOTUS Trump on his victory and the Canadian tweet- ed, "(W)e agreed to meet soon to keep building the Canada-US relationship." Trump may want to use the high- visibility first trip to do something other than affirm tradition and reflect the importance and strength of U.S.- Canadian ties. He may want to make a grand strategy statement, letting the world know that he is going to shake- up the global status quo. Calls to Taiwan, support for the Phil- ippines President Rodrigo Duterte and meeting with Japan's Shinzo Abe have already shaken up the foreign policy establishment's rules for protocol, as well as approaches to human rights and global power relations. All this well- efore Trump has even been sworn-in. Once in office, Ronald Reagan be- gan the tradition of new U.S. presidents making Canada the first foreign presi- dential visit. George W. Bush notably broke from this tradition, making his first stop Mexico, a country he knew well. He also hoped his trip and Cinco de Mayo parties on the White House lawn would attract Latino voters to the Republican Party. Trump has already been to Mexico, met with President Pena Nieto, got- ten a great presidential photo-op and made his talking points. It is unlikely he will be heading south of the border first. Making a splash abroad will likely require a large rally • similar or bigger than candidate Barack Obama's visit to Berlin in the summer of 2008 and may be chosen based on the right mix of pomp, circumstance, strategy and significance. If two big border nations are knocked PLOT-GADETTE ROR REMEMBER WHEN WE REVERED AMERICANS WHO HAD THE RIGHT STUFF? NOT REALLY... D* NEWS JOHN GLENN 1921 - 2016 TIME PERSON OF THE YEAR Markos Kounalakis out of the running for the primary re- ception of America's new head of state, where might he go first? There are any number of early sup- porters in other countries who could be rewarded and elevated by a presidential visit. The scramble to send invitations to Trump Tower has already begun. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is considering an invitation on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. Trump's friend- ship with and preference for Brexit leader Nigel Farage as Britain's next diplomatic envoy will require Trump to balance Buckingham Palace pageantry, the "special relationship," Brexit forces and a potentially restive urban populace before deciding to touch down in Lon- don Town. Numerous foreign leaders supported Trump's candidacy early on, mostly opposition politicians. A few, however, are running countries. They include Hungary's Viktor Orban, North Ko- rea's Kim Jong Un, Zimbabwe's Rob- ert Mugabe and, of course, Russia's Vladimir Putin. Rewarding them with an American inaugural visit would be revolutionary and could set in motion dramatic changes in how America's global relations, alliances and power balancing is perceived and conducted. Big, bold, groundbreaking unprec- edented moves were the hallmark of Trump's campaign: Is there a reason to believe he would take a different ap- proach to governing? Trump's brand of politics is proudly unconventional from his brand management business to his Fifth Avenue transition tower to his tweet-centric campaign. Where will he go? Japan, Russia, China, Italy, Germany, France - may- be even India, Australia or Argentina? Tipping favor toward any of the G8 member countries other than Canada for a "first visit" would create both new foreign policy opportunities and challenges. To avoid granting any nation the favor of a first foray, however, he may decide never to leave the country at all, requiring all foreign leaders visit him at Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster ... or maybe even the White House.

Alwani, the president of the India Associa- tion of the Virgin Islands and a longtime community leader, died on Nov. 19 in Miami after a bout with cancer. He was 79. Alwani, the former owner of Artistic Jewelers in Charlotte Amalie, had served on the Schneider Medical Center governing board and was a leader in the Rotary and the Masonic Lodge. He was remem- bered as the "godfather of the Indian community" as well as a friend and a mentor to many. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014510

Tuesday, December 13, 2016 Club gets facelift ISLAND LIFE The Positive Place For Kids Crowley Caribbean Services went to the Oswald Harris Court neighborhood on St. Thomas recently on behalf of the Crowley Cares Foundation and spent time sprucing up the Boys and Girls Club. Crowley personnel from St. Thomas, St. Croix, and the states helped to clean up and paint the facility and donated furniture for the children to use for their arts and craft programs. The Crowley Cares Foundation allows employees to make monthly contributions, which the company matches, to nonprofit groups in the communities Crowley serves as a cargo carrier. Crowley also delivered a check to help the club purchase a laptop computer. In addition to the contributions, employees donate their time to community groups like the Boys and Girls Club.

Art Club students will use pho- tographs of selected participants to create mixed media portraits for the calendar. Simultaneously, Carter's drama and speech dents will stu- conduct interviews with the participants that will be used to create brief write-ups to go along with the graphics. The cultural contributors were selected based on being natives of the Virgin Islands or residents for at least 15 years and also active contributors to the development of Virgin Islands' culture through fine arts, education, literature, and history. The students will formally pres- ent the finished project at a recep- tion that will feature an art exhibi- tion and theatrical performances embracing V.I. culture and hon- oring the contributors. The event will take place at St. Croix Educa- tional Complex in January. Calen- dars are available at the school in December for $12 each. The educator duo, David and Carter, developed the project so Virgin Islands students could learn about the individuals in their community that aid in the advancement of local culture. The calendar is expected to be pro- duced annually. The project is sponsored by Ro- tary Club of St. Croix, Mid Isle and the Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands.

CROIX — The St. Croix Ed- ucational Complex High School's tackle football exacted some revenge for the Virgin Is- lands, roughing up Puerto Rico's Juncos Broncos, 20-8, on Saturday night. The Barracu- das, behind the duo of Vernon Clarke and Cris- tian Perez, ran Scott Cofiell out to a 14-0 half- time lead. Clarke, Complex's quarterback, called his own number in scoring on an 18-yard run. He then handed off to Perez, the Barricudas' tailback, who scampered for a 12-yard score. The extra points were good by Ro- land Richards both rushing, but were awarded one point each. "We didn't know that the National Federation of High Schools changed the rules on extra points," said Edu- cational Complex head coach Scott Cofiell. "The new rule is one point for a rushing and two for passing. Complex poured it on in the sec- ond half when defensive end Antonio See BARRICUDAS, page 35 Photo courtesy SCOTT COFIELL St. Croix Educational Complex High School quarterback Vernon Clarke, center, hands off to tailback Cristian Perez during Saturday's game against the Juncos Broncos at Pista Atletica Municipal de Juncos in Puerto Rico.

"Our defense played very well," Cofiell said. "Aderemi Flores had an interception and had a couple of returns of 40 yards. Lejoni Williams was all over the field and led us in tackles." The Broncos added a late touch- down from Diego Luna and two- point conversion from Hernan Velez for the final score. "I was playing all my guys at that point," Cofiell said. "I wanted to give everyone the experience of playing in Puerto Rico." After the game, the Broncos set up a meet-and-greet between both team and an innovative idea came out of it. "They took care of us all week- end," Cofiell said. "They gave us a place to stay and ground transporta- tion. They even took us sightseeing of old San Juan before being dropped at the airport. "We invited them to come to St. Croix and play us during the Vir- gin Islands-Puerto Rico Friendship weekend; hopefully it could be a yearly thing. Either they come one year or we go, this was a positive ex- perience for us." "This was an amazing event," Juncos head coach Manuel Santiago said. "We were very happy to host them and we enjoyed them, too.

"I think we should have a com- bined league with Puerto Rico," Co- fiell said. "We play one home and one away every year. Look, our ticket cost $150, that's not much more than fly- ing to St. Thomas. It could be done. But before we approach Puerto Rico, we would need a unified league be- tween St. Thomas and St. Croix agreeing on stuff to make it happen. Then we could move on to Puerto Rico, They are not that far away. "They are more Puerto Rican teams than Virgin Islands teams. A mixed schedule will have to be created with a Caribbean champion between the winners of each league. People are re- ally interested in playing in football. If we're going to grow, we need to play good teams to get better and Puerto Rico has been playing a while." The Puerto Rico High School Foot- ball League is presently comprised of seven teams - - Antilles High School, Baldrich Comets, Parque Central Bluewaves, Parkville Steelers, Jun- cos Broncos, Dorado Spartans and the University Gardens Dolphins.

TAX ALERT 2016-5 DECEMBER 2016 U.S. TRUST Bank of America Private Wealth Management The 2016 Election: Tax Changes Expected INTRODUCTION The election of Donald Trump as President is expected to lead to significant tax law changes. The tax changes may come in two parts: (1) from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and its related taxes and 2) from comprehensive tax reform. Since Republicans will also have majorities' in both the House and Senate, it is anticipated that such changes could be undertaken without the need for bipartisan support. It is likely that the Affordable Care Act, and its taxes, could be repealed in early 2017 and result in an immediate tax cut for dividends, capital gains and high-income earners. It is more time consuming to enact comprehensive tax reform and such efforts may not result in a tax bill until mid- summer or the fall, which could push the Current Law* effective date of broad-based tax changes into Trump Plan 12, 25, 33% House GOP Plan 2018. Although it is not yet known exactly what the changes will be or when they would be effective, we are issuing this Tax Alert to inform you of changes that are anticipated, based on proposals made during the campaign by both President-elect Trump and the House Republicans. We also discuss how these changes may impact your planning, both currently and in the future. When we have more specifics, we expect to issue another Tax Alert.

The Alternative Minimum Tax can result in additional tax liability. The income from so-called "carried interests" is taxed as capital gain. 1 In the House of Representatives, a simple majority is sufficient to pass legislation. It is more complicated in the Senate, where 60 votes (a super majority) are required to avoid a filibuster. Republicans have a simple majority, but not a super majority, in the Senate. However, there is a budget procedure known as Reconciliation, which allows certain legislation to be passed without filibuster. Accordingly, it would appear that Republicans could pass tax legislation in the Senate with just a simple majority. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014518

TAX ALERT 2016-5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED Proposals. Both President-elect Trump and the House Republicans would lower the top tax rate for ordinary income to 33%. President-elect Trump would maintain the top rate on capital gains at 20%, though it might be applicable at a lower threshold than current law. House Republicans would lower the top rate on capital gains to one-half of the highest rate imposed on ordinary income, or 16.5%. Both President-elect Trump and the House Republicans have proposed repealing (and replacing) the Affordable Care Act, which is the source of the current 3.8% surtax. The Affordable Care Act is also the source of the extra 0.9% surtax on high-income earners (wages exceeding $250,000 for couples; $200,000 for singles) and other indirect tax increases such as the reduced cap on flexible spending accounts and tighter rules for deducting medical expenses. A repeal of the Affordable Care Act could lead to an immediate tax cut. President-elect Trump would impose a $100,000 cap on itemized deductions ($200,000 for joint filers); the House Republicans would eliminate itemized deductions other than charitable gifts and mortgage interest. Both President-elect Trump and the House Republicans would eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax. President-elect Trump's proposal would tax the income from "carried interests" as ordinary income. Planning. At its most basic, income tax planning is (i) timing income so it is recognized in a lower-tax year, and (ii) timing deductions so they are deducted in a higher-tax year. However, the proposals listed above contain both "good news" and "bad news" for 2017, so we cannot offer a universal rule as to whether income or deductions are better recognized in 2016, 2017 or even 2018. Each taxpayer needs to make an educated prediction. If there is not a clear answer, sometimes it can make sense to recognize some income (or deductions) in one year and some the next. That approach has the benefit of making sure you don't completely pick the worse year. The following are some general planning considerations. • Installment sale. If a sale is made in return for an installment note, the resulting gain can be reported on the installment method, meaning gain can be deferred into the year in which payment is received. Not all assets can be sold via the installment method, and there are several special rules. For example, marketable securities cannot be sold and reported using the installment method. We have a separate Wealth Strategy Report: Installment Sales. If a sale is made for an installment note, you can also elect to be taxed in the year of sale rather than deferring the gain. This election must be made by the due date (including extensions) of the return for the year in which the sale occurred. Thus, an installment sale in 2016 could allow you to wait until as late as October 2017 to decide whether to use the installment method or report all the gain in 2016. This could allow a decision to be made with 20/20 hindsight, at least as of October. Equity-based income. Certain types of compensation are tied to the value of an underlying stock. As one example, a nonqualified compensatory stock option's value will vary with the changing value of the underlying stock. As another example, a grant of restricted stock will be taxed when it vests, unless a so-called "83(b) election" is made to be taxed at the time of grant. In either case, the amount of compensation that is taxable will depend on the value of the stock at the appropriate time. When deciding the most favorable tax year to recognize these types of equity-based compensation, in addition to the usual considerations of the applicable tax rate, it is important to account for the expected investment performance of the underlying stock. As a simple example, deferring a stock option exercise to the next year might produce a better result not because of a better tax rate but because of the expected growth in the stock's value.

TAX ALERT 2016-5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED • Roth conversions. It is generally better to convert traditional retirement funds to a Roth IRA in a lower tax rate environment rather than a higher rate environment. For taxpayers who converted a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in 2016, the normal rules will provide a chance to review whether 2016 or 2017 would be the better year for a conversion. Generally, a 2016 conversion can be unwound ("recharacterized") as late as October 16, 2017. Following a recharacterization, the IRA could again be converted to a Roth IRA 30 days later (assuming the original conversion occurred in 2016). Thus, you could wait until October 2017 to determine whether 2016 or 2017 would be the better year for conversion based on the relative tax rates, changes in the market value of the retirement funds and other relevant considerations. If 2016, then you could let the 2016 conversion remain. If 2017, you could "recharacterize" in October of 2017 and re-convert 30 days later. ESTATE AND GIFT TAX Current law. Under current law, the federal exemption for estate and gift tax is $5 million, subject to an inflation adjustment each year. For 2016, the exemption is $5,450,000, and for 2017, it is $5,490,000. For gifts or estates above the exemption, the federal tax rate is 40%. If an appreciated asset is includible in the estate, it generally receives a step-up in basis for income tax purposes equal to the fair market value at death. Accordingly, there would be little or no capital gains tax for appreciated assets sold soon after death. Proposals. President-elect Trump has proposed to repeal the estate tax. The House Republicans' Tax Proposal also proposes federal estate tax repeal. It would appear that such repeal would be temporary, unless the tax changes proposed can be enacted on a revenue neutral basis.? It is not clear whether the federal gift tax would also be repealed. The federal gift tax may be viewed as serving two purposes. First, it serves to support the estate tax, because without it you could make unlimited gifts during your life and thereby avoid federal estate tax at death. From that perspective, repealing the estate tax would suggest that the gift tax would also be repealed. However, the gift tax also serves to support the federal income tax. Without a gift tax, income-producing property could be given to family members or others in a lower tax bracket (or residing in a state without an income tax), and subsequently given back. From that perspective, repealing the estate tax would not suggest that the gift tax also be repealed. Neither President-elect Trump's proposal nor the House Republicans' Tax Proposal includes a repeal of the gift tax. As noted, appreciated assets includible in the estate generally receive a step-up in basis. President-elect Trump has proposed to change this, however specific details have not been offered. The proposal sets forth a $10 million exemption for gains at death. It is not clear whether this exemption is for each decedent, or if that is the combined exemption for a married couple. It is also not clear whether any gains above the exemption would be subject to capital gains tax at death (in effect a deemed sale at fair market value), or only subsequently when the asset is actually sold. It is also uncertain whether any unused exemption could be transferred to a surviving spouse. 2 In order to comply with the Reconciliation procedure, the repeal needs to "sunset," resulting in reinstatement of the estate tax after approximately 10 years. Under the 2001 Tax Act, there was a temporary repeal of the estate tax (and other taxes) for this reason. Reconciliation rules will likely also add pressure to produce a revenue-neutral tax bill in order to avoid such a "sunset." That could cause Congress to abandon repealing the estate tax. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014520

TAX ALERT 2016-5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED Valuation discounts. On August 2, 2016, the IRS released proposed regulations, which may limit valuation discounts for transfers of interests in family-controlled entities. These regulations contain many ambiguities, and the IRS requested comments and held a public hearing on December 1, 2016. The regulations are controversial, many comments were sent and only a few clarifying changes were provided at the hearing. As a result of the election, we believe it is likely the IRS will not proceed with these regulations. For now, there has been no official word from the IRS. Planning. The proposal to repeal the federal estate tax appears straightforward, but will be complicated if it is temporary. The possibility of reinstatement of the estate tax may be a reason for traditional estate planning techniques, such as gifts and sales, to continue to be utilized. There is also significant uncertainty as to the related federal gift tax and basis step-up proposals. This makes current planning difficult because you may be comparing the consequences of taking action currently (such as making a gift), with the uncertain future consequences of not taking such action. Nevertheless, there are some general guidelines to consider. • It does not appear advisable to make a current gift that requires the payment of gift tax. Although the gift tax may be less costly than the estate tax, that would not be true if the estate tax is repealed • There are many types of "free" gifts that do not require the payment of gift tax, such as annual exclusion gifts, tuition and medical gifts, gifts utilizing the lifetime gift exemption, and zeroed-out GRATS. • If such gifts are being considered only to save estate tax, it does not appear necessary to make these gifts, unless there is an applicable state estate tax. However, if repeal is temporary and the estate tax will be reinstated, then such gifts may continue to be advisable. If such gifts are being considered for other non-tax reasons (such as benefitting the recipient or asset protection), such gifts may still be beneficial. Even if the gift tax were repealed, you would still have made the gift for free. If a gift will be made currently, it may be advisable to include flexible provisions, such as a trust which allows for discretionary distributions to the donor's spouse. This could allow the gift to be "undone" in the future by distributions to such spouse, if that becomes desirable. As to future planning, it will obviously depend on what changes are enacted. If the estate tax is repealed, or if other significant changes are made, all wills, trusts and estate planning documents should be reviewed to determine if any revisions are desirable. Since most wills have dispositive provisions, such as credit shelter trusts and QTIP trusts, based on the estate tax, it will require a re-thinking of estate planning and what dispositions and trusts would be appropriate. Non-tax considerations, such as trust provisions, asset protection and fiduciary selection, will play an enhanced role. If federal estate tax repeal is only temporary, it will presumably be necessary to include alternate dispositive provisions, in case the tax is reinstated. CONCLUSION The results of the 2016 election are expected to lead to significant income and transfer tax changes, some through the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act and others through a push for comprehensive tax reform. In this Tax Alert, we have highlighted some of the tax proposals, and the possible impact these changes may have on 3 We have a separate Tax Alert 2016-3, Proposed Regulations May Limit/Eliminate Valuation Discounts for Family Controlled Entities. 4 Certain states impose their own estate tax, independent of whether the federal estate tax is repealed. 4 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014521

TAX ALERT 2016-5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED planning. It is our view that due to fiscal and political pressure to keep future budget deficits in check and the narrow corridor which could result in the passage of a major tax bill (Reconciliation), we expect the tax bill to be closer to the House Republicans' Plan than the Trump Plan and perhaps narrower in scope. When more information is available, we expect to issue a more detailed Tax Alert. - National Wealth Planning Strategies IMPORTANT: This publication is designed to provide general information about ideas and strategies.

Top Picks - ACAD, AGN, ANTM, CELG, CVS, DHR, EW, EVHC, RARE, REGN, WBA Washington DC Backdrop Given the clean sweep by the GOP & uncertainty around the ACA, key attention is paid by Andy Bressler to a review of the various scenarios that could play out early next year. With a repeal likely to happen well before a replace (essentially via the Budget Reconciliation process in Jan/Feb), Andy notes this is likely to include a repeal of both health insurance exchange subsidies & a phase-down of Medicaid expansion funding (albeit with a two or three year transition period). He also expects a repeal of many of the larger HC related taxes in the ACA, including the HIX ($14.3bn in 2018), Medtech Tax (2.3%), pharma industry tax ($4.1bn in 2018) & Cadillac tax (effective 2020). As for the views by analysts... Biotech (+) - believe sector will outperform largely as pricing risk has diminished (although will remain in pockets) but pipelines/growth remains. Ying's top picks are CELG & REGN; Tazeen's top picks are ACAD & RARE. Spec Pharma (-) - headwinds remain w/ Sumant's top pick AGN given lower risk to reimbursement pressures & an underappreciated pipeline. Leverage & CF remain the key focus for investors. Tools/Animal Health (=) - Derik notes more "headline" than "real" risks from policy which will create opportunities for a group growing MSD, although valuations remain above peers. DHR (US 1 name) top pick, also A, ZTS in Animal Health, BDX in Diagnostics & CTLT in Services. Medtech (=) - Hopkins' expects a mixed bag in 2017 w/ stocks trading close to 5yr valuation lows; EW top pick given best growth / purest innovation story. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014523

Facilities (-) - Fischbeck notes that uncertainty will remain an overhang for hospitals as repeal/replace a negative for the group (est losing 2-3mm Medicaid lives & 2-3mm exchange lives would be a 1-2% EBITDA hit on avg). Focus on company-specific stories like EVHC. MCOs (+) - Fischbeck generally +ve under Trump (especially around MA given historical support from GOP) w/ tailwinds from corporate tax & rising rates. ANTM top pick in given valuation & tailwinds. Distribution/Tech (=) - Valiquette prefers pharmacies CVS/WBA given benefits from decelerating generic prices (which will remain an overhang for Distributors). HHS appointment a -ve for HCIT.

Renewed investor confidence. Bond markets under pressure. Our Chief Investment Office explores the risks and opportunities of these and other trends shaping the year ahead. Outlook 2017 AS WE LOOK BACK ON 2016, one could characterize it as The Year of The Unlikely. It began with deep worries regarding China's growth path, a second wave of collapsing oil prices, a Federal Reserve (Fed) hiking into deflationary headwinds, the impact of negative interest rates in Europe and Japan, concerns over a potential U.S. recession, lower-quality corporate HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014525

high yield problems, and U.S. consumers who might never spend their savings at the pump. All these worries hit at once in January and February, prompting the S&P 500 to fall over 10% from its 2015 closing level of 2043. The year, at that point, appeared bleak. Our view was to maintain a balanced and diversified position throughout the downturn, particularly for the long haul, due to our belief that the major concerns, although understandable, were simply not going to fully develop and asset prices would begin to track fundamentals more effectively through the remainder of the year. The potential for risk assets to climb higher was there but a catalyst was needed. For our full view on the year ahead, please read our December 2016 Monthly Letter. Exhibit 1: Mid-Cycle Slowdown Ended in Early 2016, When Oil and Dollar Stabilized) 120— Mid de Slowdown 100- Spot Oll Price: West Texas Intermediate ($/Barrel) 80 (6-Mont Moving Average, Left Scale) 60 40 Trend Growth Resuming -100 • 96 92 88 - 84 - 80 (Index) Real Broad Trade-Weighted Exchange Value of the U.S. S (6-Month Moving Average, Right Scale) 20- 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Source: ElA/CME; FRB/Haver Analytics, Data as of Decerber 5, 2016. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Our core belief was centered on healthy consumers who would indeed pick up their spending from savings at the pump and become more confident as job growth continued and real incomes increased. We also believed U.S. financial conditions and the economic backdrop would improve in the second half of the year as the pressure from the strong dollar subsided and the deflationary effects of the collapse in oil prices began to fade. In other words, we were witnessing evidence that the mid-cycle slowdown that had hurt economic growth and corporate earnings was ending. [See Exhibit 1] Based on this core belief, the "grind it out" year for risk assets would be back on track, the business cycle would extend into 2017, bond yields would slowly shift higher, and equity markets had the potential to head toward previous highs. A series of unexpected outcomes At this point, we did not characterize 2016 as The Year of the Unlikely. However, if you consider specific events throughout the year in finance and sports, it is easy to see that now. We already mentioned the second plunge in oil prices to the mid-$20s per barrel to start the year, and bond markets in some areas of the world actually had negative yields-meaning the lender paid the entity issuing the bonds to take their money! This was unlikely. How about Brexit vote in Great Britain? Unlikely. In sports, Villanova University winning the national championship in men's college basketball (Nova's first championship since 1985), Leicester-the English football club HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014526

winning the Premier League (before this season began, British bookmakers listed them as a 5,000- to-1 shot to emerge as the champion), the Cleveland Cavaliers' first ever National Basketball Association championship and, of course, the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series for the first time since 1908! All unlikely. But they happened. Last but not least, in our own political backyard, we witnessed Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election last month. Also unlikely. We all know markets do not like uncertainty. However, sentiment can shift quickly if fundamentals are not negatively affected, and what was previously determined to be "unlikely" turns to enthusiasm as to what could be. "We expect business, consumer and investor confidence to continue to head higher well into 2017, with most of the newly expected growth to come in 2018, which should underpin equities for most of the year." CHRISTOPHER HYZY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT Why this expansion can continue Business cycles typically last between five and seven years before fundamentals deteriorate, usually due to a policy error of some sort. This can produce a recession and/or a bear market, which tend to correct the excesses that have been built up and kick-start a new cycle. Bull markets and cycles do not die of old age there needs to be a fundamental catalyst that emerges and pushes the trends back the other way. We are entering our ninth year in the current business cycle, despite all of the complexities and concerns that have come and gone since the financial crisis.. In fact, this cycle could have extended another few years along the same path, given the secular stagnation that prevailed. This era needed ultra-accommodative central bank monetary policy just to keep things stable and plodding along this far into the cycle. It also needed corporations willing to manage their earnings to the penny in a below trend growth world that offered little pricing power. And finally, this cycle needed U.S. and emerging market consumers to continue to switch from deleveraging to spending as their balance sheets and incomes improved. A return of "animal spirits" This dynamic could have continued for a bit, but monetary policy has become tired. Negative interest rates have become a headwind, not a tailwind, in our view. And, just like sports fans, investors need a catalyst to break from the past. Visible positive catalysts tend to turn into improved sentiment and confidence. Through the years, economists have called this "animal spirits." Animal spirits begin as hope, turn into enthusiasm, and ultimately need visible action to keep the spirited momentum going. After all, economics is a behavioral science. It is our view that we are breaking from the era of secular stagnation and heading into fiscal reflation. This new era is likely to have its fits and starts and will not be in a straight line. It should also include different stages and speeds from various economic regions globally. Furthermore, it should contain some "unlikely" outcomes. With any cycle, we will have to take the good (higher nominal growth) with the potential HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014527

bad (higher volatility) and investors will have to reposition portfolios, rebalancing when necessary, in order to take advantage of the new era. Prior to the U.S. presidential election, and even dating back to the summer months when bond yields bottomed, the economy was already beginning to improve. Corporate earnings were picking up, the consumer was spending at a healthy clip, there were some subtle signs of positive surprises in European economic activity, and the downturn in emerging markets (and negative earnings revisions) ceased. We were certainly not waving the celebratory flag on growth, but the economy was getting up off the ground, which is what risk assets, including equities, need sometimes. However, the S&P 500—a major benchmark for U.S. stocks--had lost momentum heading into the election, as investors worried that the secular stagnation era would continue and that monetary policy had lost its effectiveness. Market sentiment changed dramatically during the early morning hours on November 9. The surprise victory by Donald Trump caught many investors off-guard. The potential for fiscal stimulus measures, reduced regulation, corporate tax reform and other potential pro-growth initiatives increased. Animal spirits perked up. Investor positioning was heavily skewed toward long-duration fixed income, low-volatility equities and high-dividend-paying companies. These areas significantly outperformed in the first half of the year but started to lose momentum once rates bottomed mid-year. However, investor positioning did not change materially at first. Portfolios were still generally overexposed to higher- quality, rate-sensitive investments otherwise known as "bond proxies." In our Hills Have Eyes strategy report, published on November 16, we outlined the need to rebalance portfolios given our belief that we were already transitioning toward the late-cycle expansion phase and that the new enthusiasm for pro-growth policies would begin to accelerate investor flows toward more cyclical investments. Given the high degree of underexposure to late- cycle investments by investors, we believed such a rotation would cause a "melt-up" in equities toward new highs over time. Diversification and rebalancing will be key So, how are we going to manage portfolios in a world undergoing a major market regime shift, one that is transitioning from the era of secular stagnation to fiscal reflation, and one that still has a considerable amount of uncertainty? We are going to become more prescriptive, remain diversified and balanced, but with more exposure to pro-growth, pro-cyclical areas. We will also likely rebalance more often throughout the year as investor rotation gathers momentum during 2017 and into 2018; and we look to periods of volatility as opportunities to add to areas we favor. "Fixed income still represents an important portfolio diversifier—and a volatility dampener in unforeseen worst-case scenarios. CHRISTOPHER HYZY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT We expect business, consumer and investor confidence to continue to head higher well into 2017, with most of the newly expected growth to come in 2018, which should underpin equities for most of the year. Higher nominal growth, an improved picture for corporate profits and continued HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014528

positive sentiment are the foundation for continued gains in the equity markets and an investor rotation from overexposure to long-dated fixed income into under owned equities. This rotation will need a few periods of confirmation, given the still uncertain broader global macro outlook, but we expect price-to-earnings multiples to remain elevated, despite higher rates, throughout the year. S&P 500 earnings have a wide range of forecasts due to the potential for sizable tax cuts in 2017. Based on this, the S&P 500 could add extra earnings on top of normalized growth, which is expected to be around 9%. At present, a reasonable range, albeit a wide one, is considered to be between $129 and $138 with the potential for further upside. In this scenario, where we get pro-growth policies filtering into a higher earnings number, an S&P 500 bull case level of 2700 at the high end is possible. Improving profits and growth should take equities higher For now, a base case utilizing the five factor framework from BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, which combines sentiment, valuation and technical, equates to 2300 for the S&P 500 at year end. The two components that include long-term valuation and 12-month price momentum are indicating that S&P 500 levels between the base and bull case are increasing in probability. Of course, there are a number of scenarios that could unfold that would indicate a wide range of outcomes depending on the multiple or earnings number that ultimately develops. In the end, it all comes down to the path of corporate profits and the visibility on growth, both of which are improving. Highlights We have moved from a "get paid to wait" core portfolio theme to a more cyclical- and value- oriented theme in multi-asset portfolios • Equities remain attractive versus fixed income on a relative basis. • Within equities, we favor U.S. large caps, U.S. small caps and emerging markets. • Within equities, we favor value over growth and more cyclical assets versus defensives. • Within fixed income, we prefer credit to Treasuries. We would also consider an allocation to Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) where appropriate. Portfolio repositioning is likely to continue well into 2017, as developments unfold and the pro- cyclical environment gathers momentum. With growth already heading higher from Q3 2016 onward and earnings turning positive, investors have begun increasing cyclicality and exposure to value in portfolios at the expense of more defensive sectors and higher-dividend areas within equities. In addition, we expect a larger shift in emphasis toward small capitalization, which has already started, and more domestic-oriented equities due to a slightly stronger dollar, more pro- growth policies and the desire for a hedge against potential retaliatory trade policies from main HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014529

trading partners. This portfolio shift in positioning is happening but, in our view, is in its early stages. We have moved from a "get paid to wait" core portfolio theme to a more cyclical and value- oriented theme in multi-asset and all-equity portfolios primarily due to increased business and consumer confidence, which should lead to higher earnings than originally expected. • • Therefore, we have raised our exposure to equities versus fixed income to a moderate overweight and our new tactical asset allocation view is overweight equities versus its strategic benchmark. We are now further underweight fixed income versus equities, underweight versus its strategic benchmark rather than neutral, and have lowered cash to neutral from overweight. Within the asset classes, we have made a number of changes consistent with our view from earlier this year and one that has accelerated post-election. We are now moderately overweight U.S. small capitalization equities and neutral non-U.S. developed markets. We maintain our preference for U.S. high-quality large caps and continue to overweight emerging markets. • We continue to favor value over growth and more cyclical areas (such as financials and consumer discretionary) versus defensives (such as utilities and consumer staples). In fixed income, we have moved from a balanced view to a larger underweight versus the strategic benchmark. • However, fixed income still represents an important portfolio diversifier-and a volatility dampener in unforeseen worst-case scenarios and should be viewed primarily as a cash flow producer versus a total return asset, given the expectations for higher yields. In addition, we have lowered Treasuries to a further underweight but maintain our neutral rating on high yield and underweight on international fixed income. Municipal bonds have corrected to levels that are becoming attractive again, and we are still favorable on investment grade corporate credit. We maintain our neutral rating on real estate and commodities, but we prefer metals and oil to gold. In addition, the pro-cyclical improvement has started to break down the elevated correlation among and within asset classes since earlier in 2016. We expect this adjustment to continue in 2017 as economic volatility picks up and asset class volatility follows suit. Transitions to late-cycle phases tend to invite a higher level of volatility as inflation rises and central bank policies shift to nudging short rates higher. In this environment, alternative investments, namely hedge funds, should outperform industry benchmarks, in contrast to recent underperformance. For investors able to withstand a higher allocation of illiquid assets in their portfolio, we prefer timberland for its long term-growth prospects and low correlation to financial assets. Paul V.

2017 OUTLOOK Dear Clients, Readers of our previous Outlook publications may recall that this page typically summarizes the key themes of our economic and financial market prospects for the coming year. However, for 2017 we decided that a brief overview would not suffice, given the current environment of high market valuations, great policy uncertainty, significant geopolitical tensions and, in all likelihood, an unconventional US presidency. Since the trough of the global financial crisis, we have consistently emphasized US preeminence and maintained a strategic overweight to US equities relative to global market capitalization-weighted benchmarks. Tactically, we have had an overweight allocation to US equities and US high yield bonds from as early as mid-2008. Even when US equities became more expensive, we continued to recommend that clients stay fully invested at their strategic allocations. Indeed, we have reiterated that recommendation in our past Outlook publications, client calls and Sunday Night Insight reports as many as 59 times since January 2010. But now we have crossed into the 10th decile of valuations: US equities have been more expensive than current levels only 10% of the time in the post-WWII period. Yet we continue to recommend staying the course. We are duly aware that this recommendation is long in the tooth, particularly given such high valuations and the unusually high level of policy uncertainty. Policy uncertainty, both economic and political, abounds globally: uncertainty with respect to Brexit (the how and when), upcoming elections in Germany and France (the who), transitional government in Italy (the how long followed by what) and new appointments to the Standing Committee in China and their significance (the who and what of any reform agenda), to name a few. We are also facing rising geopolitical tensions that could trigger significant market volatility. Tensions in the Middle East will not abate. Greater Russian involvement in that region is stabilizing in some respects and destabilizing in others. Further Russian incursions into Eastern Europe may elicit a more robust reaction from the West. Terrorism could spread in the US and Europe as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) loses territory in Iraq and Syria and foreign fighters return home. North Outlook Investment Strategy Group 1 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014534

Korea's nuclear program and missile launches go unchecked. There is rising risk of military incidents—or accidents—in the South China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait. China is the most likely source of global economic shocks over the next two to three years. The country's leadership continues to prioritize imbalanced economic growth over structural reforms, thereby increasing debt at an unsustainable pace. Such increases will eventually prove to be destabilizing. In Donald Trump, the US has elected an unconventional president in many respects, including his more US-centric approach to China. If China responds to, say, imposition of US tariffs on imports of Chinese products by sharply devaluing the renminbi, significant downside volatility and tighter global financial conditions will follow. Given already high US equity valuations, uncertain economic and political policy prospects and heightened geopolitical risks, readers may well ask why we continue to recommend staying fully invested in US equities. Among the reasons: • Our eight-year US preeminence theme is intact and continues into its ninth year. As Professor Jeremy Siegel of the University of Pennsylvania wrote 23 years ago in Stocks for the Long Run' and recently repeated in a Wall Street Journal interview, "Stocks are the best long-run asset." We refine that view by saying US equities are the best long-run asset. • We think that the policy backdrop in the US will be particularly favorable for the economy, with looser fiscal policy, relatively easy monetary policy and a less stringent regulatory environment. We expect US growth to continue through 2017. • We expect global growth to improve modestly, from 2.5% in 2016 to 2.9% in 2017, with looser fiscal policy and still easy monetary policy in key countries. • And last but not least, we expect that while President-elect Trump's initial policy measures with respect to tariffs and trade agreements risk jolting financial markets, as a self-described "deal maker" he will likely adjust and change course as necessary to achieve his desired results. We may have a bumpy ride, but the US economy will not be derailed. Over the years, we have viewed the glass as half-full—if not full—when it comes to the US economy. Many others have seen the glass as half-empty, pointing out that productivity growth has decreased, US labor demographics are less favorable and government policies have been ineffective. While it is correct that productivity growth has decreased and labor demographics are less favorable, it does not follow that the US economy is in stagnation. Quite the reverse. 2 / Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017 HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_014535
