China moved to clamp down  on excessive speculation in commodities, after weeks of frenzied trading boosted prices and ignited fears of another bubble in its domestic markets.Dow stock United Technologies (UTX) raised its dividend by 2 cents to 66 cents per share, an increase of 3 percent. The dividend is payable on June 10 to shareholders of record as of May 20. STOCKS TO WATCH

Eli Lilly (LLY) missed estimates by 2 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 83 cents per share, although revenue was above forecasts. The drug giant was helped by selling more product at higher prices, although its results were negatively impacted by currency fluctuations.
Express Scripts (ESRX) matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.22 per share, with the pharmacy benefit manager's revenue slightly below analyst forecasts. However, the company raised its full year outlook as its growth accelerates. Pioneer Natural (PXD) lost 64 cents per share in the quarter, smaller than the 78 cents analysts were expecting. But revenue was considerably below estimates on weaker commodity prices. The drilling company did see production rise more than expected during the quarter, and it boosted its full year production outlook.
The Container Store (TCS) matched estimates with per-share profit of 20 cents, with revenue slightly above forecasts. The storage products retailer also announced it was cutting jobs and freezing wages as it tries to restore bottom line growth. WATERCOOLER
