Priceline Group (PCLN) earned an adjusted $15.14 per share for its latest quarter, beating estimates. Revenue also exceeded forecasts. However, bookings were slightly short of forecasts as were the travel website operator's current quarter earnings guidance.TripAdvisor (TRIP) beat estimates by 8 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 38 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts. However, the travel website operator cut its full-year 2017 guidance due in part to a shift to less profitable mobile device booking.Hertz Global (HTZ) posted an adjusted quarterly loss of 63 cents per share, more than triple the estimate of a 20 cents per share loss. Revenue matched. Hertz said it's made significant progress in its turnaround plan, but cited challenging business environment.TrueCar (TRUE)
 earned an adjusted 1 cent per share for its latest quarter, compared to forecasts of a breakeven quarter. The car-buying service's revenue beat forecasts as well. However, TrueCar issued weaker than expected full-year guidance.Zillow (Z) earned an adjusted 4 cents per share for the second quarter, surprising analysts who had expected a 1 cent per share loss. The real estate website operator's revenue also beat forecasts, but shares were under heavy pressure.Office Depot (ODP) missed estimates by 2 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 6cents per share. Revenue also missed forecasts. Office Depot also said it expects 2017 sales to be lower than they were a year ago, due to store closures and challenging market conditions.Wendy's (WEN) beat estimates by 2 cents a share, with
 adjusted quarterly profit of 15 cents per share. Revenue also topped forecasts. Wendy's said about one-third of its global restaurants have been "re-imaged" as it continues a planned revamping.WATERCOOLER
