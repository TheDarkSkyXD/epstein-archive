Amgen (AMGN) came in 30 cents above estimates, earning an adjusted $2.90 per share, with revenue also above expectations. The biotech giant also raised its 2016 outlook, as best-selling drugs like its rheumatoid arthritis treatment Enbrel continue to sell well.Gilead Sciences (GILD) fell 12 cents short of expectations with quarterly earnings of an adjusted $3.03 per share, and its revenue missing forecasts as well. Pricing pressure in the hepatitis C market was among the factors weighing on Gilead's results.LinkedIn (LNKD) reported adjusted quarterly profit of 74 cents per share, 14 cents above estimates, with revenue also soaring past forecasts. The business social network boosted full-year outlook, in contrast to the disappointing guidance in February, which cut the stock nearly in

The company also raised full-year guidance, with results from its Coinstar unit making up for declines in movie rentals at Outerwall's
