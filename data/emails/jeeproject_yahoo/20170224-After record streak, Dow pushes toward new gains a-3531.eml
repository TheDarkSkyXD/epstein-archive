Two reports will conclude the week's economic data, with both coming at 10 a.m. ET. The government's January new home sales report is expected to show a 5.8 percent increase to an annual rate of 570,000 units, partially reversing a December decline of 10.4 percent.And the final February University of Michigan consumer sentiment index is expected to come in at 95.7, slightly lower than the last reading of 96.0.Earnings reports out this morning include the latest numbers from retailers Foot Locker (FL) and J.C. Penney (JCP). There are no earnings reports due after today's closing bell.STOCKS TO WATCH

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is among our stocks to watch today, with the corporate hardware and software maker reporting adjusted quarterly profit of 45 cents per share, 1 cent above estimates. However, revenue fell short of forecasts, and the company also cut its full-year profit forecast due to a stronger dollar and execution issues, among other factors.J.C. Penney (JCP) announced it would close up to 140 stores over the next few months on the back of a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report that beat the Street's expectations, though revenue and same-store sales fell shy. Earnings came in at 64 cents per share versus the estimated 61 cents.Nordstrom (JWN) beat estimates by 22 cents with quarterly profit of $1.37 per share, with the retailer's revenue essentially in line. Nordstrom
 did give a weaker-than-expected full-year earnings outlook and a prediction of flat comparable store sales.Gap (GPS) reported in-line earnings, with adjusted quarterly profit of 51 cents per share, and revenue slightly above estimates. The retailer also said its efforts to turn around will bear fruit, with comparable store sales likely to be up this year for the first time in three years. However, the company did give full-year earnings guidance that falls somewhat short of Street forecasts.CBOE Holdings (CBOE) will be joining the S&P 500 next week, swapping places with Pitney Bowes (PBI), which will move to the S&P MidCap 400.Pearson (PSO) announced plans to further cut expenses and sell more assets. However, the education services provider's shares are getting a boost on indications
 that balance sheet deterioration of the past few years has bottomed out.Baidu (BIDU) posted a revenue decline for a second straight quarter, but the China-based search engine company forecast a rebound this year as it expands its revenue base outside its core search business.Intuit (INTU) issued a better-than-expected revenue outlook for the current quarter, after reporting a slower-than-usual start to the tax season earlier this year. Intuit is the maker of the best-selling TurboTax software.Herbalife (HLF) issued a weaker-than-expected current quarter and full-year outlook, with currency-related headwinds among the key factors weighing on the nutritional products maker's results.Capital One (COF) revealed that its anti-money laundering practices are being investigated by federal
 regulators. That news came in an SEC filing, although it had mentioned receiving subpoenas and requests for testimony in a filing in November.
