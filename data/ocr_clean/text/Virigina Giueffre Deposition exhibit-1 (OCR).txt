Jeffrey's home when you arrived?
A.
Yes.
When I first walked in the door, it
was just myself, and Ghislaine headed for the
staircase and said -- told me to come up to the
living room.
And what happened at that point, when you
came up to the living room?
A. I came up and saw Virginia, Jeffrey,
Prince Andrew, Ghislaine in the room.
And did you meet Prince Andrew at that
time?
A. Yes.
And what happened next?
A.
At one point, Ghislaine told me to come
upstairs, and we went into a closet and pulled out
the puppet, the caricature of Prince Andrew, and
brought it down. And there was a little tag on the
puppet that said "Prince Andrew" on it, and that's
when I knew who he was.
e.
And did -- what did the puppet look like?
A.
It looked like him. And she brought it
down and presented it to him; and that was a great
joke, because apparently it was a production from a
show
on BBC.
And they decided to take a picture
with it, in which Virginia and Andrew sat on a

always covered himself with a towel.
l. I believe I asked this, but I just want to
clarify to make sure that I did: Did Maxwell ever
ask you to bring other girls over to -- for Jeffrey?
A.
Yes.
Yes?
A.
Yes.
l.
And what did you -- did you do anything in
response to that?
A.
I did bring one girl named Francesca --
no.
Florence -- it was some girl named Florencia
that I had worked with at a restaurant. And I
recall Ghislaine giving me money to bring her over;
however, they never called her to come.
l.
And then I believe you mentioned that one
of your physical fitness instructors, you brought a
physical fitness instructor; was that correct?
A.
Correct.
And what did she do?
She gave him a -- like a training session,
twice.
A.
e.
Twice.

exposed her bra, and she grabbed it and pulled it
down.
Q. Anything else?
A. That was the conversation that he had told
her that he had taken this girl's virginity, the
girl by the pool.
Okay.
Did Maxwell ever say to you that it
8 takes the pressure off of her to have other girls
around?
A.
e.
A.
She implied that, yes.
In what way?
Sexually.
And earlier Laura asked you, I believe, if
Maxwell ever asked you to perform any sexual acts,
and I believe your testimony was no, but then you
also previously stated that during the camera
incident that Maxwell had talked to you about not
finishing the job.
Did you understand "not finishing the job"
meaning bringing Jeffrey to orgasm?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form.

I'm sorry, Johanna, let me correct that
question.

when she said you hadn't finished the job, with
respect to the camera?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form.
THE WITNESS: She implied that I had not
brought him to orgasm.
BY MS. McCAWLEY:
So is it fair to say that Maxwell expected
you to perform sexual acts when you were massaging
Jeffrey?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form,
foundation.
THE WITNESS: I can answer?
Yes, I took that conversation to mean that
is what was expected of me.
BY MS. MCCAWLEY:
And then you mentioned, I believe, when
you were testifying earlier that Jeffrey told you a
story about sex on the plane. What was that about?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, hearsay.
THE WITNESS: He told me one time Emmy was
sleeping on the plane, and they were getting
ready to land. And he went and woke her up,
and she thought that meant he wanted a blow
job, so she started to unzip his pants, and he
said, No, no, no, you just have to be awake for

A.
Just that Jeffrey would like to have some
photos of me, and she asked me to take photos of
myself.
e. What did you say?
A. I don't remember saying no, but I never
ended up following through. I think I tried once.
This was the pre-selfie era, correct?
A.
Exactly.
l. I want to go back to this: You testified
to two things just now with Sigrid that you said
were implied to you.
A.
Okay.
e.
The

was it would take pressure
off of Maxwell to have more girls around?
