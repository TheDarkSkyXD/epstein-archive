Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 2 of 12 


Plaintiff, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts 
(“Giuffre”), for her Complaint against Defendant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL (“Maxwell”), avers 
upon personal knowledge as to her own acts and status and otherwise upon information and 
belief: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 

1. This suit arises out of Defendant Maxwell’s defamatory statements against 
Plaintiff Giuffre. As described below, Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while 
she was a minor child. Defendant Maxwell not only facilitated that sexual abuse but, most 
recently, wrongfully subjected Giuffre to public ridicule, contempt and disgrace by, among other 
things, calling Giuffre a liar in published statements with the malicious intent of discrediting and 
further damaging Giuffre worldwide. 

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

2. This is an action for damages in an amount in excess of the minimum 
jurisdictional limits of this Court. 

a: This Court has jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332 
(diversity jurisdiction) as Giuffre and Maxwell are citizens of different states and the amount in 
controversy exceeds seventy-five thousand ($75,000), exclusive of interest and costs. 

4. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Maxwell. Maxwell resides in New York 
City, and this action arose, and defamatory statements were made, within the Southern District of 
New York. 

5: Venue is proper in this Court as the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of 


this Court. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 3 of 12 


PARTIES 
6. Plaintiff Giuffre is an individual who is a citizen of the State of Colorado. 
7. Defendant Maxwell, who is domiciled in the Southern District of New York, is 
not a citizen of the state of Colorado. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
8. Virginia Giuffre became a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse 


after being recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when Giuffre was under the age 
of eighteen. 

9. Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell, 
Epstein sexually abused Giuffre at numerous locations including his mansions in West Palm 
Beach, Florida, and in this District. Between 2001 and 2007, with the assistance of numerous 
co-conspirators, Epstein abused more than thirty (30) minor underage girls, a fact confirmed by 
state and federal law enforcement. 

10. As part of their sex trafficking efforts, Epstein and Maxwell intimidated Giuffre 
into remaining silent about what had happened to her. 

11. In September 2007, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) 
that barred his prosecution for numerous federal sex crimes in the Southern District of Florida. 

12, In the NPA, the United States additionally agreed that it would not institute any 
federal criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein. 

13. As a co-conspirator of Epstein, Maxwell was consequently granted immunity in 
the Southern District of Florida through the NPA. 

14. Epstein ultimately pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution, and is now a 


registered sex offender. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 4 of 12 


1: Rather than confer with the victims about the NPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
and Epstein agreed to a “confidentiality” provision in the Agreement barring its disclosure to 
anyone—including Epstein’s victims. As a consequence, the victims were not told about the 
NPA. 

16. On July 7, 2008, a young woman identified as Jane Doe No. 1, one of Jeffrey 
Epstein’s victims (other than Giuffre), filed a petition to enforce her rights under the Crime 
Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. ¥ 3771, alleging that the Government failed to 
provide her the rights promised in the CVRA with regard to the plea arrangement with Epstein. 
The litigation remains ongoing. 

i. On or about May 4, 2009, Virginia Giuffre—identified then as Jane Doe No. 
102—filed a complaint against Jeffrey Epstein in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida. The complaint included allegations made by Giuffre that pertained 
to Maxwell. 

18. In pertinent part, the Jane Doe No. 102 complaint described in detail how 
Maxwell recruited Giuffre (who was then a minor girl) to become a victim of sex trafficking by 
introducing Giuffre to Jeffrey Epstein. With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to 
sexually abuse Giuffre for years until Giuffre eventually escaped. 

19. The Jane Doe No. 102 complaint contained the first public allegations made on 
behalf of Giuffre regarding Maxwell. 

20. As civil litigation against Epstein moved forward on behalf of Giuffre and many 
other similarly-situated victims, Maxwell was served with a subpoena for deposition. Her 
testimony was sought concerning her personal knowledge and role in Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre 


and others. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 5 of 12 


21. To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that 
consequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning. In 
fact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to 
New York. 

22. In 2011, two FBI agents located Giuffre in Australia—where she had been hiding 
from Epstein and Maxwell for several years—and arranged to meet with her at the U.S. 
Consulate in Sidney. Giuffre provided truthful and accurate information to the FBI about 
Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse. 

23: Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that 
she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also 
suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse. 

24. On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims 
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation. 

ao, Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against 
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to 
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of 
sexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex 
trafficking. 

26. On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously 
filed by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein’s non-prosecution 


agreement by filing her own joinder motion. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 6 of 12 


2d. Giuffre’s motion described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who 
Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and 
participant in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. 

28. In January, 2015, Maxwell undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to 
discredit Giuffre and to so damage her reputation that Giuffre’s factual reporting of what had 
happened to her would not be credited. 

29. As part of Maxwell’s campaign she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to attack 
Giuffre’s honesty and truthfulness and to accuse Giuffre of lying. 

30. On or about January 3, 2015, speaking through her authorized agent, Maxwell 
issued an additional false statement to the media and public designed to maliciously discredit 


Giuffre. That statement contained the following deliberate falsehoods: 


(a) That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” 


(b) That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.” 


(c) That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.” 


31. Maxwell’s January 3, 2015, statement incorporated by reference “Ghislaine 
Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same,” an earlier 
statement that had falsely described Giuffre’s factual assertions as “entirely false” and “entirely 
untrue.” 

32. Maxwell made the same false and defamatory statements as set forth above, in the 
Southern District of New York and elsewhere in a deliberate effort to maliciously discredit 
Giuffre and silence her efforts to expose sex crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, 


Epstein, and other powerful persons. Maxwell did so with the purpose and effect of having 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 7 of 12 


others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further damaged Giuffre’s 
reputation. 

33. | Maxwell made her statements to discredit Giuffre in close consultation with 
Epstein. Maxwell made her statements knowing full well they were false. 

34. Maxwell made her statements maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex 
trafficking crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons. 

a5: Maxwell intended her false and defamatory statements set out above to be 
broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence Giuffre from making further efforts to 
expose sex crimes committed by Maxwell, Epstein, and other powerful persons. 

36. Maxwell intended her false statements to be specific statements of fact, including 
a statement that she had not recruited an underage Giuffre for Epstein’s abuse. Maxwell’s false 
statements were broadcast around the world and were reasonably understood by those who heard 
them to be specific factual claims by Maxwell that she had not helped Epstein recruit or sexually 
abuse Giuffre and that Giuffre was a liar. 

OT; On or about January 4, 2015, Maxwell continued her campaign to falsely and 
maliciously discredit Giuffre. When a reporter on a Manhattan street asked Maxwell about 
Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell, she responded by saying: “I am referring to the statement 
that we made.” The New York Daily News published a video of this response by Maxwell 
indicating that she made her false statements on East 65" Street in Manhattan, New York, within 


the Southern District of New York. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 8 of 12 


COUNT I 
DEFAMATION 


1. Plaintiff Giuffre re-alleges paragraphs 1 - 37 as if the same were fully set forth 
herein. Maxwell made her false and defamatory statements deliberately and maliciously with the 
intent to intimidate, discredit and defame Giuffre. 

2. In January 2015, and thereafter, Maxwell intentionally and maliciously released to 
the press her false statements about Giuffre in an attempt to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and 
cause her to lose all credibility in her efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. 

a Maxwell additionally released to the press her false statements with knowledge 
that her words would dilute, discredit and neutralize Giuffre’s public and private messages to 
sexual abuse victims and ultimately prevent Giuffre from effectively providing assistance and 
advocacy on behalf of other victims of sex trafficking, or to expose her abusers. 

4, Using her role as a powerful figure with powerful friends, Maxwell’s statements 
were published internationally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual abuse and 
sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and credibility; to cause the world to 
disbelieve Giuffre; and to destroy Giuffre’s efforts to use her experience to help others suffering 
as sex trafficking victims. 

a Maxwell, personally and through her authorized agent, Ross Gow, intentionally 
and maliciously made false and damaging statements of fact concerning Giuffre, as detailed 
above, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere. 

6. The false statements made by Gow were all made by him as Maxwell’s 


authorized agent and were made with direct and actual authority from Maxwell as the principal. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 9 of 12 


a The false statements that Maxwell made personally, and through her authorized 
agent Gow, not only called Giuffre’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed 
Giuffre to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace. 

8. Maxwell made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely 
false. Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest 
degree of awareness of falsity. 

2. Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel, as she knew that they were going to 
be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print. Maxwell intended her 
false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets internationally, and they 
were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District of New York. 

10. Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel per se inasmuch as they exposed 
Giuffre to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in 
the minds of right-thinking persons. 

11. Maxwell’s false statements also constitute libel per se inasmuch as they tended to 
injure Giuffre in her professional capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed 
to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation 
among members of the community that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve. 

12, Maxwell’s false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out 
against sex trafficking Giuffre acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task. 
Maxwell’s false statements directly and indirectly indicate that Giuffre lied about being recruited 
by Maxwell and sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell’s false statements were 
reasonably understood by many persons who read her statements as conveying that specific 


intention and meaning. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 10 of 12 


12: Maxwell’s false statements were reasonably understood by many persons who 
read those statements as making specific factual claims that Giuffre was lying about specific 
facts. 

14. Maxwell specifically directed her false statements at Giuffre’s true public 
description of factual events, and many persons who read Maxwell’s statements reasonably 
understood that those statements referred directly to Giuffre’s account of her life as a young 
teenager with Maxwell and Epstein. 

15: Maxwell intended her false statements to be widely published and disseminated 
on television, through newspapers, by word of mouth and on the internet. As intended by 
Maxwell, her statements were published and disseminated around the world. 

16. Maxwell coordinated her false statements with other media efforts made by 
Epstein and other powerful persons acting as Epstein’s representatives and surrogates. Maxwell 
made and coordinated her statements in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere with 
the specific intent to amplify the defamatory effect those statements would have on Giuffre’s 
reputation and credibility. 

UT Maxwell made her false statements both directly and through agents who, with 
her general and specific authorization, adopted, distributed, and published the false statements on 
Maxwell’s behalf. In addition, Maxwell and her authorized agents made false statements in 
reckless disregard of their truth or falsity and with malicious intent to destroy Giuffre’s 
reputation and credibility; to prevent her from further disseminating her life story; and to cause 
persons hearing or reading Giuffre’s descriptions of truthful facts to disbelieve her entirely. 
Maxwell made her false statements wantonly and with the specific intent to maliciously damage 


Giuffre’s good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts to administer her 


10 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 11 of 12 


non-profit foundation, or share her life story, and thereby help others who have suffered from 
sexual abuse. 

18. As a result of Maxwell’s campaign to spread false, discrediting and defamatory 
statements about Giuffre, Giuffre suffered substantial damages in an amount to be proven at trial. 

19. Maxwell’s false statements have caused, and continue to cause, Giuffre economic 
damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and other 
direct and consequential damages and losses. 

20. Maxwell’s campaign to spread her false statements internationally was unusual 
and particularly egregious conduct. Maxwell sexually abused Giuffre and helped Epstein to 
sexually abuse Giuffre, and then, in order to avoid having these crimes discovered, Maxwell 
wantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit Giuffre. In so doing, 
Maxwell’s efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back Giuffre’s 
efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and 
punitive damages are appropriate. 

21. Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Maxwell and 
others from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit Giuffre and other 
victims of sex trafficking. 

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Giuffre respectfully requests judgment against Defendant 
Maxwell, awarding compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an 
amount to be determined at trial, but in excess of the $75,000 jurisdictional requirement; costs of 


suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

several years ago in the United Kingdom accusing Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell of 
serious and criminal sexual abuse from 1999-2002. Plaintiff repeated those allegations in 
litigation pleadings to which Ms. Maxwell was not a party and which since have been 
stricken as “immaterial and impertinent.” Those pleadings were widely circulated to the 
public by various media outlets in the United States and abroad, further generating 
interest in Plaintiffs spurious claims. Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse extend 
beyond just Ms. Maxwell and encompass many notable public figures, such as Prince 
Andrew and Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, as well as un-named “numerous 
American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known 
Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” Plaintiffs targeting of such notable public 
figures has served only to enhance the media spotlight on the false accusations directed at 
Ms. Maxwell. 

In response to Plaintiffs published claims, Ms. Maxwell (like Prince Andrew and 
Professor Dershowitz), issued general denials to the allegations. Those two denials form 
the basis of this defamation action: Plaintiff claims it defamatory for Ms. Maxwell to 
have issued statements through her London agent that Plaintiff’s allegations “are untrue,” 
“shown to be untrue” and “obvious lies.” 

Long-settled New York law renders denials such as Ms. Maxwell’s privileged 
under the law and requires dismissal of this defamation action. As one commentator 
wrote in 1881, “If I am attacked in a newspaper, I may write to that paper to rebut the 


1 


charges, and I may at the same time retort upon my assailant, when such retort is a 
necessary part of my defense, or fairly arises out of the charges he has made against me.” 
William Blade Odgers, A Digest of the Law of Libel and Slander (1* Am. ed. Bigelow 
1881). Because Ms. Maxwell’s denials were proportionate, relevant and not excessively 
publicized replies to Plaintiffs claims, rendered without malice, she is entitled to the 
privilege of self-defense and this Complaint should be dismissed. Moreover, because the 
denials when viewed in context demonstrate that they were pre-litigation demands to the 
British newspapers to cease and desist, they likewise are entitled to the litigation 
privilege. 

Finally, the Complaint falls woefully short of a well-pled defamation claim. New 
York law makes clear that general denials, as compared to specific defamatory denials, 
are non-actionable in defamation. Plaintiff also neglected to state when, to whom and in 
what manner the statements were made and she omitted any special damages or facts 
establishing defamation per se. 

Each of these reasons forms a separate and independent basis to dismiss the 
Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Ms. Maxwell seeks this Court’s assistance in 
serving as a gatekeeper to dismiss this spurious defamation claim.Be clear: Maxwell 
absolutely denies VR’s claims made about her in pleadings filed in cases to which she was not a 
party and in paid media interviews to trashy British publications. 

“General denials are not actionable” in defamation. General denials issued as a part of a 


cease and desist to the news organizations publishing the false and salacious accusations are 


privileged. No special damages and no defamation per se. 


FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS! 


Plaintiff has repeatedly and falsely accused Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell of sexual abuse 
occurring between 1999 and 2002. Since 2009, Plaintiff has set forth these false claims in 
pleadings filed in various federal civil actions in Florida. Compl. { 8-21, 26-27. Ms. Maxwell 
was not a party to any of those litigations: not the criminal case against Mr. Epstein (Compl. 

{ 14), any non-prosecution agreement between Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
(Compl. J] 11-13), the litigation concerning the Crime Victim’s Rights Act (CVRA) still 
pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Compl. {fff 15-16), and not 
Plaintiff's 2009 civil suit against Mr. Epstein (Compl. {| 17-21). No criminal charges were ever 
brought against Ms. Maxwell, and Plaintiff never sought to join Ms. Maxwell to any of her civil 
matters involving Mr. Epstein. 

Plaintiff's accusations against Ms. Maxwell were not confined to legal proceedings, 
however. Beginning in or around March 2011, Plaintiff granted “exclusive” interviews to the 
British press, using her real name, during which she repeated her false allegations against Ms. 
Maxwell and also levied accusations against countless prominent public figures such as Prince 
Andrew, Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, and “a well-known businessman (whose 
pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a world-renowned scientist, a respected liberal 
politician and a foreign head of state.” See Declaration of Laura A. Menninger (“Menninger 


Decl.”’) Ex. A, at 3. 


, This statement of facts is based on (1) the allegations set forth in the Complaint; and (2) documents 
referenced in the Complaint, but which were not attached to the pleading. U.S. S.E.C. v. Power, 525 F. Supp.2d 
415, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (J. Sweet) (On a motion to dismiss, “[t]he Court may also consider any 
documents...incorporated by reference into the complaint.”). Further, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d), if the 
motion is treated as one for summary judgment, “[a]ll parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all 
the material that is pertinent to the motion.” 


In response to Plaintiffs 2011 British tabloid interviews, on March 9, 2011 a “Statement 
on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell” was issued by Devonshires Solicitors (“2011 Statement’). 
Menninger Decl. Ex. B.’ The 2011 Statement provides in its entirety: 


Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about her that have appeared 
recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false. 


It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms. Maxwell’s legal representatives to 
certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be 
withdrawn have simply been ignored. 


In the circumstances, Ms. Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against 
those newspapers. 


“T understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain 

newspapers live by the adage, ‘why let the truth get in the way of a good story.’ 

However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and I 

ask that they stop,” said Ghislaine Maxwell. 

‘““A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their 

reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation 

or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name,” she said. 
Plaintiff did not bring suit against Ms. Maxwell for defamation based on the 2011 Statement. 

More than three years later, on December 30, 2014, Plaintiff moved under Rule 21 to join 
the 2008 CVRA litigation in the U.S. District for the Southern District of Florida (“Joinder 
Motion”). Compl. ¥] 16, 26, 27. Plaintiff included in her Joinder Motion “lurid details” 
concerning her supposed sexual abuse by Ms. Maxwell and other non-parties to that CVRA 
action, including professor Alan Dershowitz, “numerous American politicians, powerful business 
executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” 


Menninger Decl. Ex. C at 4-5. On April 7, 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Marra denied 


Plaintiff's Joinder Motion, ordered the portions of the Joinder Motion pertaining to non-parties 





q Although the Complaint does not explicitly mention the 2011 Statement, it appears Plaintiff believes it to 
be the “additional” statement referenced on paragraphs 30 and 31 based on her production of the statement as a part 
of her Rule 26 disclosures.

such as Ms. Maxwell stricken as “immaterial and impertinent,” and restricted the documents 
mentioning those “lurid details” from public access. Jd.; Menninger Decl. Ex.D. Despite the 
court’s attempt to shield the false statements, the bell could not be un-rung. The same day the 
Joinder Motion was filed, British and U.S. press began publishing numerous stories based on its 
contents. See, e.g., Politico, “Woman Who Sued Convicted Billionaire Over Sex Abuse Levels 
Claims at his Friends.” (Dec. 31, 2014). 

According to the Complaint, it was on January 3, 2015, a few days after the Joinder 
Motion was publicly filed, that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have “spoken through her authorized 
agent” to “issue an additional false statement to the media and public.” Compl. § 30. According 
to the Complaint, this January 3, 2015 Statement “contained the following deliberate 
falsehoods”: (a) Plaintiff's sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue,” (b) the 
allegations have been “shown to be untrue;” and (c) Plaintiff's “claims are obvious lies.” Id. The 
January 3 Statement also “incorporated by reference” an “original response to the lies and 
defamatory claims” made by Ms. Maxwell, which response purportedly had described Plaintiff's 
allegations as “entirely false” and “entirely untrue.” Compl. § 31. Copies of the entire January 3 
Statement and the “original response” were not included in or attached to the Complaint. The 
Complaint also did not detail where the January 3 Statement was made, to whom it was made, 
nor any factual assertion regarding its publication by any news media. 

The Complaint supplies one additional purportedly defamatory statement. According to 
Plaintiff, on January 4, 2015, “a reporter on a Manhattan street” “asked Ms. Maxwell about 
[Plaintiffs] allegations” and Ms. Maxwell “responded” with the phrase: “I am referring to the 


statement that we made” (“January 4 Statement’). Compl. §/ 37. This video was published by

the New York Daily News. (Id.) Indeed, although not detailed in the Complaint, the New York 
Daily News website contains a video entitled “Ghislaine Maxwell declines comment on 


allegations she is a madam.” 


The filmed portion of the encounter begins with Ms. Maxwell 
stating that “I wish you a happy new year and thank you so much;” whatever is said prior to that 
statement was not recorded. A voice then inquires, “so you’re basically not commenting, is 
that...”; Ms. Maxwell’s response, perhaps “I’m referring to the statement that was made," is 
barely audible. Another person questions, “is any of that true?” Ms. Maxwell then responds 
“C’mon guys” and walks away. According to the Complaint, this “response” demonstrates Ms. 
Maxwell’s “continued...campaign to falsely and maliciously discredit” Plaintiff. Compl. §[ 37. 

The Complaint does not allege damages in detail. It generically asserts that Plaintiff has 
suffered “economic damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional 
distress, and other direct and consequential damages.” Compl. Count 1 § 19. Further, Plaintiff 
claims she “incorporated an organization called Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for- 
profit corporation” on December 23, 2014, approximately 10 days before the January 3 
Statement. Compl. {ff 24-25. Plaintiff's role with the corporation, her profession, and any basis 
for Ms. Maxwell to even know of the corporation’s existence are not alleged, but the Complaint 
baldly asserts that the January 3 and 4 Statements “tended to injure [Plaintiff] in her professional 
capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking.”

(quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “Plausibility” means the 
claim must be supported by facts that establish more than “a sheer possibility that a defendant 
has acted unlawfully.” Cruz v. Marchetto, No. 11 Civ. 8378, 2012 WL 4513484, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. a, 2012) (quoting Cohen v. Stevanovich, 772 F.Supp.2d 416, 423 (S.D.N.Y. 
2010)). 

In the defamation context, the Court acts as a gatekeeper and should dismiss claims in 
which the challenged statements are not “reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning.” 
Krepps v. Reiner, 588 F.Supp.2d 471, 483 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (Sweet, J.) (citing Treppel v. Biovail 
Corp., No. 03 Civ. 3002 (PKL), 2005 WL 2086339, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2005)). As courts 
in this district have recognized, there is “particular value” to resolving defamation claims at the 
pleading stage, as protracted litigation can have a chilling effect on the exercise of 
constitutionally protected freedoms. Biro v. Conde Nast, 883 F.Supp.2d 441, 457 (S.D.N.Y. 
2012) (quoting Armstrong v. Simon & Schuster, Inc., 625 N.Y.S.2d 477, 481 (N.Y. 1995). 


I. MS. MAXWELL’S STATEMENTS ARE PRIVILEGED* 


To succeed on a claim for libel, or defamation based on written statements, pursuant to 
New York law, a plaintiff must establish the “elements [of] a false statement, published without 
privilege or authorization to a third party, constituting fault as judged by, at a minimum, a 


negligence standard, and, it must either cause special harm or constitute defamation per se.” 


. Under New York’s choice-of-law rules for defamation actions, the general rule is that “the state of the 
plaintiff's domicile (in this case, Colorado) will usually have the most significant relationship to the case” and 
therefore that state’s law will govern. Adelson v. Harris, 973 F. Supp.2d 467, 477 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal 
quotations omitted). However, in multistate cases such as this in which the alleged defamatory statement was 
published nationally, there is only a presumptive rule that the law of plaintiff's domicile applies. Jd. That 
presumption may not hold when some other state has a more significant relationship to the issues or the parties. Id. 
Here, because Ms. Maxwell is a resident of New York, and one of the purported statements was made in New York, 
this state has arguably a more substantial relationship to the alleged tort than does Colorado. Nonetheless, the laws 
of Colorado and New York are substantially similar. For these reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to apply New 
York law, but will note any differences between the two laws when applicable. 


Dillon v. City of New York, 704 N.Y.S.2d 1, 5 (1st Dep’t 1999) (emphasis added). “[I]n light of 
the incorporation of a lack of privilege into the elements of a defamation claim,” a Court may 
properly dismiss a defamation such a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) where a qualified privilege 
is established. Orenstein v. Figel, 677 F.Supp.2d 706, 711 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); see also Fuji Photo 
Film U.S.A., Inc. v. McNulty, 669 F.Supp.2d 405 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). 

Ms. Maxwell’s Statements are privileged both under the New York self-defense privilege 
and the pre-litigation privilege and the Complaint should therefore be dismissed. 

A. The Self-Defense Privilege Protects Ms. Maxwell’s Statements 

“Every man has a right to defend his character against false aspersion. It may be said that 
this is one of the duties that he owes to himself and to his family. Therefore communications 
made in fair self-defense are privileged. If I am attacked in a newspaper, I may write to that 
paper to rebut the charges, and I may at the same time retort upon my assailant, when such retort 
is a necessary part of my defense, or fairly arises out of the charges he has made against me.” 
William Blake Odgers, A Digest of the Law of Libel and Slander (\st Am. ed. Bigelow 1881). 

New York, along with numerous other jurisdictions® and the Restatement (Second) of 
Torts, recognizes a qualified privilege to respond in self-defense to verbal defamatory attacks 
levied by another upon the speaker. See, e.g., Kane v. Orange Cnty. Publ’n, 232 A.D.2d 526, 
527 (2d Dept. 1996) (“[S]ince the open letter was the [defendant’s] response to unfavorable 
publicity against him—publicity concededly generated ‘with the cooperation of plaintiffs’—it 
was covered by a qualified privilege.”); Shenkman v. O’Malley, 157 N.Y.S.2d 290, 297-98 (1st 
Dep’t 1956); Siegel v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 32 N.Y.S.2d 658 (1st Dep’t 1942); Fowler v. 


New York Herald, 172 N.Y.S. 423 (1 Dep’t 1918); Preston v. Hobbs, 146 N.Y.S. 419 (1st Dep’t 





: See Foretich v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 37 F.3d 1541, 155-60 & n.19 (4th Cir. 1994) (collecting cases). 
8 


1914); Mencher v. Chesley, 85 N.Y.S.2d 431 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1948) (“The pertinent authorities 
hold that a person subjects his own motives to discussion when he makes a public attack upon 
another. Legitimate self-defense is not limited to a mere denial of the charges, but it may include 
a proper counterattack in the forum selected by the plaintiff”); see also Restatement (Second) of 
Torts § 594 cmt. k (1977) (“A conditional privilege exists under the rule stated in this Section 
when the person making the publication reasonably believes that his interest in his own 
reputation has been unlawfully invaded by another person and that the defamatory matter that he 
publishes about the other is reasonably necessary to defend himself. The privilege here is 
analogous to that of self-defense against battery, assault or false imprisonment . . . Thus the 
defendant may publish in an appropriate manner anything that he reasonably believes to be 
necessary to defend his own reputation against the defamation of another, including the 
statement that his accuser is an unmitigated liar.”).’ 

In Collier v. Possum Cereal Co., Ltd., 134 N.Y.S. 847, 853 (1st Dep’t 1912), the self- 
defense privilege was explained: 


The important question is whether the defendant had the right to 
impugn the motives of its assailant, if it did so honestly without 
malice and for the sole purpose of repelling the assault upon it, and 
not with the view of injuring the plaintiff. One who makes a 
public attack upon another subjects his own motives to discussion. 
It is a contradiction in terms to say that the one attacked is 
privileged only to speak the truth, and not to make a counter attack, 
or that legitimate self-defense consists only in denial of the charge 
or a statement of what is claimed to be the truth respecting its 
subject-matter. One in self-defense is not confined to parrying the 
thrusts of his assailant. Of course, the counter attack must not be 
unrelated to the charge, but surely the motives of the one making it 


: Although the Colorado appellate courts apparently have not yet ruled on the issue of self-defense 
privilege, the 10" Circuit has deemed it a “safe presumption” that Colorado Supreme Court would adopt the various 
provisions of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977) as part of “its common law of defamation” based on its 
decisions and Uniform Jury Instructions. See TMJ Implants, Inc. v. Aetna, Inc., 498 F.3d 1175, 1182-83 qo" Cir. 
2007); see also Williams v. Burns, 463 F.Supp. 1278, 1282 (D. Colo. 1979) (recognizing qualified privilege defense 
for protecting one’s interest).

are pertinent. The plaintiff selected the forum for the dispute, and 

in that forum it would certainly tend to repel, or minimize the 

harmful tendency of the charges to show that the one making them 

was actuated by an improper motive. 
See also Sack, Robert D., Sack on Defamation: Libel, Slander and Related Problems (Practicing 
Law Inst., Apr. 2015 ed.) at Kindle Loc. 20357-20370 (“A person also has a right to defend 
himself or herself from charges of unlawful activity... The right to defend oneself against 
defamation is a recognized interest. An individual is privileged to publish defamatory matter in 
response to an attack upon his or her reputation; the speaker is given more latitude in such a 
situation than if the statements were not provoked.”). 

Each of the Statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell and her representatives regarding 
Plaintiff was issued in self-defense. Plaintiff ignited this controversy by asserting in the British 
press her public accusations that Ms. Maxwell had committed sexual abuse. Menninger Decl. 
Ex. A. (Plaintiff's interview with Daily Mail) Plaintiff further fanned the flames by filing in 
U.S. federal court on December 30, 2014 “immaterial and impertinent” “lurid details” in a public 
pleading which again accused Ms. Maxwell of committing sexual abuse. Menninger Decl. Ex. 
C. Given her many previous dealings with the media on this topic, Plaintiff clearly filed those 
public pleadings with knowledge (or more probably an intention) that such materials would be 
published by the press. Compl. {J 26, 27. Ms. Maxwell’s January 3 Statement, according to the 


999 


Complaint, states that the allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue,’” the claims are 
“obvious lies,” have been “shown to be untrue,” and the “claims are all obvious lies.”” Each 
attributed statement responds directly to allegations and claims made by Plaintiff. Compl. { 31. 
Likewise to the extent the claimed statement that “Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the 


lies and defamatory claims remains the same” (Compl. § 32) refers to an earlier statement 


describing Plaintiffs “factual assertions as ‘entirely false’ and ‘entirely untrue,” those also 


10 


respond directly to allegations and claims made by Plaintiff.8 And the J anuary 4 Statement refers 
to another “statement” and is therefore entitled to the same privileges as any other “statement.” 

Nor has Plaintiff demonstrated that the self-defense privilege was “‘abused” so as to 
remove the defense. According to the Second Circuit (interpreting New York law), once the 
defendant has proved that she is entitled to a qualified privilege, there arises a rebuttable 
presumption of good faith that may constitute a complete defense. In order to rebut this 
presumption, the plaintiff must demonstrate two things: (1) that the statement was false, and (2) 
that the defendant abused its qualified privilege. Weldy v. Piedmont Airlines, Inc., 985 F.2d 57, 
62 (2d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted). With regard to self-defense, the “privilege may be lost...if 
the reply: (1) includes substantial defamatory matter that is irrelevant or non-responsive to the 
initial statement; (2) includes substantial defamatory material that is disproportionate to the 
initial statement; (3) is excessively publicized; or (4) is made with malice in the sense of spite or 
ill will.” Sack, supra; Restatement (Second) of Torts, §§ 599, 603-605A (1977). 

Here, Plaintiff has not—and cannot—establish that the privilege was lost. Each of the 


statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell is relevant, directly responsive, and proportional to 


99 66 99 66 


Plaintiff's accusations. That the statements are “untrue,” “obvious lies,” “shown to be untrue” or 
were “denied” are each the type of statements that the self-defense privilege seeks to protect. 
Foretich, at 1560 (“To be responsive, a reply’s contents must clearly relate to its supposed 
objective—blinding the initial attack and restoring one’s good name. Statements that simply 
deny the accusations, or directly respond to them, or express one’s impressions upon first hearing 


them are certainly responsive.”); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 594 cmt. k (“The defendant 


may publish...the statement that his accuser is an unmitigated liar.”). Further, the statements 





8 bors : , 
The January 4 Statement similarly refers to an earlier statement. Compl. 7 37 (“I am referring to the 
statement that we made.”’)) 


11 


contain no substantial defamatory material, much less a disproportionate amount. Plaintiff has 
not alleged to whom the statements were made and thus cannot show that the supposed Maxwell 
statements were “excessively publicized.” In any event, given the viral circulation of Plaintiff's 
allegations against Ms. Maxwell, as any cursory internet search can attest, it would be impossible 
to argue that Ms. Maxwell’s statements were “excessively publicized” relative to the accusations 
to which they were responsive. 

Finally, Plaintiff offers no allegations to support her conclusory assertion that the 
Statements were made with “malice in the sense of spite or ill will.” To sufficiently plead 
“actual malice” the plaintiff must set forth “non-conclusory allegations that support a plausible 
inference of actual malice.” Biro v. Conde Nast, 2014 WL 4851901 at *2. Bare allegations that 
the defendant knew or should have known that the statements were false is insufficient. Id.” To 
establish malice, a defamed plaintiff must show...that such malicious motivation was the one 
and only cause for the publication.” Hoesten v. Best, 821 N.Y.S.2d 40 (1st Dep't 2006). Given 
the content and context of the Statements, there are no grounds to conclude that a malicious 
motivation was the cause of their publication. The January 3 Statement concludes that “Miss 
Maxwell denies allegations of an unsavory nature which have appeared in the British press and 
elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such claims.” Menninger 
Decl. Ex. E. The clear motivation for the Statement was to deny the allegations and to place 
British newspapers on notice that they may be sued for repeating Plaintiffs false claims. 
Nothing in the Statement evinces a sense that it was published out of spite or ill will towards 
Plaintiff. The Complaint’s repeated use of the word “malice” and “ill-will” are nothing more 


than conclusory allegations based on surmise, conjecture and suspicion and do not suffice to 





- Also, merely repeating the same conclusory allegation, as done in the Complaint, is equally insufficient. 
Yuan v. Rivera, No. 96 Civ. 6628 (HB) (LB), 1998 WL 63404, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1998) (“This conclusory 
allegation, repeated throughout the complaint, falls shy of [stating a claim.]”).

establish malice. See Culver v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 94 CIV. 8124 (LBS), 1995 WL 422203, at 
*6 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 1995) (“[A] complaint must contain more than conclusory allegations 
based upon surmise, conjecture and suspicion.’’). 

The self-defense privilege thus applies and is reason enough to dismiss the Complaint. 


B. The Pre-Litigation Privilege Protects Ms. Maxwell’s Statements 


Statements made by attorneys and parties pertinent to good faith anticipated litigation are 
conditionally privileged.'° Reasoning that “[w]hen litigation is anticipated, attorneys and parties 
should be free to communicate in order to reduce or avoid the need to actually commence 
litigation . ..Communication during this pre-litigation phase should be encouraged and not 
chilled by the possibility of being the basis of a defamation suit.” Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 24 
N.Y.3d 713, 720 (N.Y. 2015).'' The Court of Appeals in Khalil expressly declined to apply the 
“general malice standard” to the pre-litigation privilege. Instead, the court held the qualified 
privilege is lost only where the party opposing dismissal “proves that the statements were not 
pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation.” Jd. The Court of Appeals then upheld the 
dismissal of a defamation complaint premised upon pre-litigation letters including a demand and 
cease-and-desist notice because the statements contained in these documents were privileged. 

In cases preceding Khalil, New York appellate courts made clear the litigation privilege 
covers statements made in connection to “pending or contemplated litigation,” Caplan v. 


Winslet, 218 A.D.2d 148, 153 (1st Dep’t 1996) (emphasis added), including “all pertinent 





0 Colorado law also recognizes a privilege for communications made “in reference to the subject matter of 
the proposed or pending litigation” and therefore, Ms. Maxwell’s Statements are privileged whether this Court 
applies New York or Colorado law. See Club Valencia Homeowners Ass’n, Inc. v. Valencia Associates, 712 P.2d 
1024, 1027 (Colo. App. 1985) (“The purpose of this privilege...is to afford litigants the utmost freedom of access to 
the courts to preserve and defend their rights...’). 


In England, where all statements except the January 4 Statement one were made, the litigation privilege 
is broader than in the United States. As Justice Cardozo recognized, there the privilege exists whether the 
statements are relevant to the judicial proceedings or not. Andrews v. Gardiner, 224 N.Y. 440, 445 (N.Y. 1918). 


13 


communications among the parties, counsel, witnesses and the court,” regardless of “[w]hether a 
statement was made in or out of court, was on or off the record, or was made orally or in 
writing.” Frechtman v. Gutterman, 979 N.Y.S.2d 58 (1st Dep’t 2014) (quoting Sexter v. 
Warmflash, P.C. v. Margrabe, 828 N.Y.S.2d 315 (1st Dep’t 2007)). In International Publishing 
Concepts, LLC v. Locatelli, 9 N.Y.S.3d 593, 2015 N.Y. Slip Op. 50049 at *3-4 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 
Jan. 15, 2015), letters and emails which detailed likely litigation and an intent to sue were 
extended the same pre-litigation privilege although sent to two non-parties who were only 
potentially affected by the litigation or witnesses to it. See also Kirk v. Heppt, 532 F.Supp.2d 
586 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (“The privilege is broad, and embraces anything that may possibly or 
plausibly be relevant to the litigation.”) (internal citations omitted). 

Ms. Maxwell’s 2011 Statement, incorporated by reference into the January 3 Statement, 
was issued by Devonshires Solicitors in London and explicitly sought to place the British 
tabloids on notice that litigation against them was forthcoming should they persist in printing 
Plaintiff's falsehoods. Menninger Decl. Ex. B. The general denial of the first paragraph 
(“Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about her that have appeared recently in the 
media. These allegations are all entirely false.”’) is followed by four paragraphs directly 
threatening litigation against newspapers: 

It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms. Maxwell’s legal 
representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth and 
asking for the allegations to be withdrawn have simply been 
ignored. 


In the circumstances, Ms. Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal 
action against those newspapers. 


“T understand that newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well 
known that certain newspapers live by the adage, ‘why let the truth 
get in the way of a good story.’ However, the allegations made 
against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask that they 
stop,” said Ghislaine Maxwell. 


14 


‘““A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy 
in their reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most 
elementary investigation or any real due diligence. Iam now 
taking action to clear my name,” she said. 


Td. 

A statement issued by attorneys, asking the newspapers to cease and desist publication of 
Plaintiff's false allegations, stating an intent to “take legal action against those newspapers,” 
pointing out the lack of accuracy in reporting and duly diligent reporting, and expressing again 
an intent to “take[e] action to clear” her name all demonstrate that the statement was “pertinent 
to good faith anticipated litigation” and should be afforded a litigation privilege. The 
newspapers were the potential parties to an action for repetition of the falsehoods, not some 
third-parties unaffiliated with potential claims held by Ms. Maxwell. Cf. Kirk, 532 F.Supp.2d at 
594 (statements to malpractice insurance carrier entitled to privilege). 

The January 3 Statement, issued by the same spokesperson as the 2011 Statement, 
likewise represents a statement “pertinent to” anticipated good-faith litigation. Following 
another general denial (i.e., the “allegations are untrue’), the statement goes on to say that they 
are “obvious lies” and “should be treated as such and not publicized as news, as they are 
defamatory. Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory statements 
remains the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have 
appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the 
repetition of such claims.” Menninger Decl. Ex. E. These statements are pertinent to anticipated 
litigation against the press who was reporting Plaintiff’s falsehoods and should be afforded the 
same qualified privilege. See Locatelli, supra at *4 (“While such an injunction has not yet been 
sought, that fact should not be outcome determinative. Rather, it appears to have been intended 


at the time that these letters and emails were written...’’). 


15 


Finally, the January 4 Statement, in response to a request for comment as she left her 
apartment, “I am referring to the statement that was made,” should be afforded the same 
privilege as any undefined “statement” to which it referred. 

Il. PLAINTIFF FAILED TO PLAUSIBLY PLEAD DEFAMATION 

Under either New York or Colorado law, to state a cause of action for defamation, a 
plaintiff must prove: (1) defendant made a defamatory statement of fact concerning the plaintiff; 
(2) defendant published the statement to a third party; (3) defendant acted with the requisite 
fault; (4) the statement was false; and (5) resulting injury to the plaintiff. Kforce, Inc. v. Alden 
Personnel, Inc., 288 F.Supp.2d 513, 516 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Zerr v. Johnson, 894 F. Supp. 374, 
376 (D. Colo. 1995). Regarding injury, plaintiffs must prove special damages—meaning 
economic or financial loss—unless the defamation falls within a category of defamation per se. 
Kforce, Inc., 288 F. Supp.2d at 516; Thai v. Cayre Grp., Ltd., 726 F. Supp. 2d 323, 330 
(S.D.N.Y. 2010) (defining special damages). Defamation per se constitutes a statement “which 
tends to disparage a person in the way of his office, profession or trade.” Id. To be per se 
actionable, there must therefore be a direct link between the statement and the plaintiff's 
particular profession. Id. 

Although state law applies to the merits of defamation claims, Rule 8 of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure governs the pleading requirements in federal court. Under Rule 8, 
defamation allegations must be “simple, concise and direct,” allowing the defendant sufficient 
notice of the communications complained of to allow the defendant to defend him or herself. 
Deutsche Asset Mgmt, Inc. v. Callaghan, No. 01 Civ 4426 CBM, 2004 WL 758303, at *12 
(S.D.N.Y. April 7, 2004). Importantly, to meet this standard, plaintiff must specify who made 
the statements, when they were made, to whom they were made and in what context they were 


made. Id. 
16 


Here, the defamation claim is fatally deficient for three independent reasons: (1) when 
viewed in context, the statements are not actionable defamatory statements; (2) the Complaint 
does not allege to whom or where the statements were made; and (3) the Complaint lacks either 
allegations of special damages or facts from which defamation per se could be established. Each 
of these three faults, standing alone, is sufficient to warrant dismissal for failure to state a claim. 


A. Viewed In Context, the Statements are Non-Actionable 


The Complaint improperly contains only excerpts of Ms. Maxwell’s Statements, thereby 
depriving the Court of the ability to adequately determine whether the Statements are actionable. 
The Supreme Court has long recognized the inherent difficulty in deciding defamation claims 
given the delicate balance between “the law of defamation and the freedoms of speech and press 
protected by the First Amendment.” Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 325 (1974). On 
the one hand, the law of defamation is designed to “redress and compensate individuals who 
suffered serious harm to their reputations due to the careless or malicious communications of 
others.” Keohane v. Stewart, 882 P.2d 1293 (Colo. 1994). On the other hand, the First 
Amendment protects “society’s interest in encouraging and fostering vigorous public debate.” 
Id. (citing Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J. dissenting)). 

Due to the complexity of these competing interests, it is essential for courts to resolve as 
a matter of law whether the particular words alleged to be defamatory are in fact defamatory— 
i.e. designed to cause reputational injury. See Celle v. Fillipino Reporter Enters, Inc., 209 F.3d 
163, 177 (2d Cir. 2000). To do so, defamatory statements must be considered in the context of 
the entire communication and the circumstances in which they were written. Jd. at 178; see also 
Keohane, 882 P.2d at 1299. As one court aptly stated, “Courts will not strain to find defamation 
where none exists.” Couloute, Jr. v. Rynarz, No. 11 CV 5986 (HB), 2012 WL 541089, at *5 


(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2012). 
17 


In this case, Plaintiff is essentially asking this Court to “strain to find defamation” based 
on only snippets of Ms. Maxwell’s January 3 and January 4 Statements provided in the 
Complaint. See Compl. { 30. Her failure to provide the context within which the Statements 
were delivered alone warrants dismissal. Dillon v. City of New York, 261 A.D.2d 34, 39-40 (1st 
Dep’t 1999) (plaintiffs failure to set forth the entirety of the alleged defamatory statement 
resulted in only vague and conclusory allegations requiring dismissal); Edwards v. Great 
Northern Ins. Co., No. 03 CV 2947 (NG) (RML), 2006 WL 2053717, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July 21, 
2006) (dismissing defamation claim for plaintiffs failure, among other things, to plead the 
context in which the statements were made); Wanamaker v. Columbian Rope Co., 713 
F.Supp.533, 545 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (same). 

When Ms. Maxwell’s statements are actually viewed in context, it becomes clear why 
Plaintiff only provided excerpts. The Complaint describes Ms. Maxwell’s Statements as an 
attack on Plaintiff's honesty and truthfulness and a “concerted and malicious campaign to 
discredit Giuffre.” Compl. 28, 29. In reality, the statements are far from an attack by Ms. 
Maxwell. When read in context and as set forth above, it is clear that the January 3 Statement 
was issued in self defense and in anticipation of good-faith litigation against the news media. 
The January 3 Statement appears, inter alia, in a telegraph article entitled “Prince Andrew denies 
having relations with ‘sex slave’ girl.” Menninger Decl. Ex. E. The 12-page article contains 
denials by Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz. Buried among those allegations is the 
following response by Ms. Maxwell’s spokesman: 

The allegations made against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. Miss 
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavory nature, which 
have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her 


right to seek redress at the repetition of such old defamatory 
claims. 


18 


Menninger Decl. Ex. E, at 2. As discussed above, such a statement, which was unequivocally 
made in response to repeated reputation-harming allegations, is protected by both the privilege of 
self-defense and the pre-litigation privilege and therefore is not actionable. 

Further, general denials such as the January 3 Statement are not actionable as defamatory 
statements. See McNamee v. Clemens, 762 F.Supp.2d 584, 601 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (“general 
denials of accusations aren’t actionable’’); Independent Living Aids, Inc. v. Maxi-Aids, Inc., 981 
F.Supp. 124, 128 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (epithet “liar,” in context, where it reflects a mere denial of 
accusations, was personal opinion and rhetorical hyperbole). The context surrounding the 
January 3 Statement demonstrates it was a general denial made in self-defense and pre-litigation 
and therefore not actionable as a defamation claim. 

Likewise, when viewed in context, it is equally clear that the January 4 Statement is not 
an actionable statement of fact. The Complaint avers that “Maxwell continued her campaign to 
falsely and maliciously discredit” Plaintiff “when a reporter on a Manhattan street asked 
Maxwell” about the allegations and she “responded” by saying “I am referring to the statement 
that we made.” Compl. § 37. It also alleges that the New York Daily News "published a video" 
of “this response by Maxwell.” Yet the video found on the New York Daily News website of this 
encounter reveals substantially more context. See supra at__. First of all, Ms. Maxwell is 
accosted by the reporters as she emerged from an apartment on East 65th Street. The video is 
entitled accurately enough “Ghislaine Maxwell declines comment on allegations she is a 


9912 


madam.”’~ The filmed encounter begins with Ms. Maxwell stating that “I wish you a happy new 


year and thank you so much.” A voice then inquires, “so you’re basically not commenting, is

andrew-article-1.2065505 (accessed November 30, 2015). 


19 


that...”; her response, “I’m referring to the statement that was made,” is barely audible. Another 
person questions, “is any of that true?” Ms. Maxwell then responds “C’mon guys” and walks 
away. 

The argument that the January 4 Statement is actionable defamation borders on frivolous. 
There are not even any questions which give the “interview” context, i.e., what the reporters said 
just before the camera clip begins, what “allegations” Ms. Maxwell was “responding” to. 
Certainly nothing in the context of the video mentions Plaintiff or her allegations. Any 
reasonable listener would understand the verbal video clip together with the heading “Ghislaine 
Maxwell declines comment on allegations she is a madam” to be just that—a declination to 
comment. The “statement that was made” is not even contextualized. Which statement? Made 
when and to whom? Even the Complaint characterizes the verbal words as a “response” to 
questions from a reporter. Even a strained reading of the allegations concerning the January 4 
Statement does not demonstrate a defamatory meaning of and concerning Plaintiff, and any 
claim based thereon should be dismissed." 


B. The Complaint Does Not Allege to Whom, Where or in What Manner 
the January 3 Statement was Made 


It is long settled that “[f]ailure to state the particular person or persons to whom the 
allegedly slanderous or libelous comments were made as well as the time and manner in which 
the publications were made warrants dismissal.” Hawkins v. City of New York, No. 99 Civ. 
11704 (RWS), 2005 WL 1861855, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2005); see also Cruz, 2012 WL 
4513484, at *4 (dismissing a defamation claim for failure to specifically allege the “when, where 


or in what manner the statements were made’). 





13s : 3,3 : : 
Without the January 4 Statement to the New York Daily News reporter, it is entirely unclear that this 
case has any nexus to the United States, much less New York. 


20 


In Hawkins, the Complaint generally alleged that the defendants made false 
representations of fact about the plaintiff to “other supervisors of [p]laintiff with [the] NYPD.” 
Id. This Court held that by not identifying the individuals to whom the statement was allegedly 
made the claim was “fatally defective.” Id. Likewise, in J.P.R. Cafeteria, Inc. v. Kingsborough 
Community College of City University of New York, 847 N.Y.S.2d 902 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Aug. 21, 
2007), the defendant alleged in a counterclaim that the plaintiff made libelous and slanderous 
statements to employees and agents of his employer and the media. Id. at *5. Again, because 
the counterclaim did not identify the particular persons to whom the defamatory comments were 
made, it was dismissed. Id.; see also Cruz, 2012 WL 4513484, at *4 (dismissing a complaint 
containing conclusory allegations that defendant made statements that ended up in the headlines 
and quoted in the media). Here, as in Hawkins, the Complaint does not allege to whom the 
January 3 Statement was made. Instead, it merely contains the general allegation that it was 
“issued...to the media and public.” Compl. § 30. This precedent establishes that merely 
identifying a group or organization to whom the statement was published, such as “the media” or 
“the NYPD” is insufficient. Thus, because the Complaint only identifies the “media and public” 
as the recipient of the January 3 Statement, the pleading is insufficient. 

C. Plaintiff Has Not Properly Pled Special Damages 

a. The Alleged Defamatory Statement is Not Defamatory Per Se 

Plaintiff also fails to properly establish either defamation per se or special damages. The 
pleading is therefore defective. Thompson v. Bosswick, 855 F.Supp.2d 67, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 2012); 
Kforce, 288 F.Supp.2d at 516. Defamation per se is limited in scope and is only applicable when 
there is a direct link between “a particular profession and a particular disreputable vice of that 
profession.” Id. While explaining defamation per se, this Court quoted the following passage 


from Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 112, at 791 (Sth ed. 1984): 
2 


[I]t is actionable without proof of damage to say of a physician that 
he is a butcher..., of an attorney that he is a shyster, of a school 
teacher that he has been guilty of improper conduct as to his 
pupils, of a clergyman that is the subject of scandalous rumors, of a 
chauffeur that he is habitually drinking, of a merchant that his 
credit is bad or that he sells adulterated goods, of a public officer 
that he has accepted a bribe or has used his office for corrupt 
purposes...since these things discredit [one] in his chosen calling. 

The New York Court of Appeals, elaborating on this same concept, further noted that the 
defamatory “statement must be made with reference to a matter of significance and importance 
for [the plaintiff's profession, trade or office], rather than a more general reflection upon the 
plaintiff's character or qualities.” Liberman v. Gelstein, 80 N.Y.2d 429, 590 (N.Y. 1992). “The 
statement must be targeted at the specific standards of performance relevant to the plaintiffs 
business and must impute conduct that is ‘of a kind incompatible with the proper conduct of the 
business, trade, profession or office itself.’” Thompson, 855 F.Supp.2d at 77 (quoting Pure 
Power Boot Camp, Inc. v. Warrior Fitness Boot Camp, LLC, 813 F.Supp.2d 489, 550 (S.D.N.Y. 
2011)). 

Here, it is impossible to determine a link between the January 3 or 4 Statements and 
Plaintiff's profession, because no profession is alleged. The only reference in the Complaint to 
Plaintiffs “profession” is in paragraphs 24 and 25 where she describes incorporating the Victims 
Refuse Silence, Inc. organization. Importantly, she allegedly incorporated that organization on 
December 23, 2014, approximately 10 days before the January 3 Statement. Compl. { 24. 
Further, other than stating the intent and goals of this newly incorporated organization, she has 
not described any actions taken by the organization or provided any indication that the 
organization is currently operating nor detailed her “occupation” within the organization. 


Given the close temporal proximity between the creation of Plaintiff's organization and 


the issuance of the Statements, it strains credulity to suggest that Ms. Maxwell even knew about 


22 


the organization or Plaintiff's supposed profession attendant thereto. If Ms. Maxwell had never 
heard of Victims Refuse Silence—which is likely—it is equally impossible to suggest that she 
directed any statements towards Plaintiff's role therein. Even accepting Plaintiff's allegations as 
true, the January 3 Statement is at most a general reflection upon Plaintiffs character or 
qualities. More accurately, the Statement can only be characterized as a reaction to certain 
specific allegations made by Plaintiff towards Ms. Maxwell. According to clear precedent set by 
this Court and the New York Court of Appeals, the Statement therefore is not defamation per se. 


b. Failure to Allege Special Damages Warrants Dismissal 


Because the January 3 Statement is not per se actionable even accepting the Plaintiff's 
allegations as true, the Court then must scrutinize the Complaint for allegations of special 
damages. Special damages are generally considered financial or economic damages that are 
“causally related to the alleged acts.” Hawkins, 2012 WL 4513484, at *19. Special damages 
“must be fully and accurately stated, with sufficient particularity to identify actual losses...The 
particularity requirement is strictly applied, as courts will dismiss defamation claims for failure 
to allege special damages with the requisite degree of specificity.” Thai v. Cayre Group, Ltd., 
726 F.Supp.2d 323, 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). Plaintiff has not and cannot claim special damages as 
a result of Ms. Maxwell’s alleged defamatory statements. Instead, her allegations of damages 
are vague and conclusory and provide no factual basis to establish a causal connection to the 
alleged defamation. See Compl. { 19 (“Maxwell’s false statements have caused, and continue to 
cause, Giuffre economic damage...”). This obvious pleading defect also mandates dismissal. 

CONCLUSION 


For the reasons stated above, the Complaint fails to state a claim for which relief 


can be granted. Ms. Maxwell therefore respectfully requests that this Court dismiss the 


23 


Complaint with prejudice. In addition, in light of Plaintiff’s failure to show any factual 
basis for her claim, Ms. Maxwell requests permission to move for attorneys’ fees for the 
filing of this motion and any subsequent action necessary to prevent from further 
attempts by Plaintiff to direct additional unfounded and legally insufficient claims against 
Ms. Maxwell.

+ Virginia Roberts reveals she is ‘Jane Doe 102’ In Jeffrey Epstein case 

« Mother-of-three spent four years as millionaire's personal masseuse 

« She describes being flown across world to meet Prince Andrew 

- Epstein trained her ‘as a prostitute for him and his friends’ 

As the UK's special representative for international trade, the Duke of York holds an important 
position, requiring sound judgement and widespread respect. 


But those qualities have been thrown into question since photographs of Prince Andrew with his 
billionaire financier friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child-sex offender who was jailed for 18 
months for soliciting underage prostitutes, appeared last weekend, 


Today, however, even more serious doubts are cast on his suitability afer a woman at the centre of 
the Epstein case revealed to The Mail on Sunday that she had, as a 17-year-old employed by 
Epstein, been flown across the world to be introduced to the Prince, 


hitodAwww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl- 17-sex-offender-friend-flew-Britain-meet-him html 









Firat meeting: Prince Andrew puts his arms around 17-year-old Virginia, centre 


On one of those occasions Virginia Roberts was subsequently pald $15,000 (£9,400). Her shocking 
account of her four years as Epstein’s personal masseuse is supported by court decuments, an 
eyewitness, photographs and flight details of Epstein’s private jets. 


One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrews first encounter with the girl in 
March 2001 and published today by The Mail on Sunday, shows the Prince with his arm around her 
waist. 


This is not the first time the Duke of York’s judgment and choice of associates have been 
questioned. He appears to relish the company of super-rich off billionalres from the Middle East, 
North Africa and the former Soviet Union. 


The peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £15 million after it had 
languished unsoki for five years at £12 million has never been satisfactorily explained. 


In the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official 
corruption investigation into the huge ALYamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, 
while he Is also sald to be close to Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president, 
and may have had a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi. 


But ft is Andrew's friendship with Epstein, whom Wh j | eon th e streets I 
, 


he has known since at least 2000, and with 
Epstein’s confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter sl e pt with men for 
money. I was a 


of the late disgraced newspaper baron Robert 
paedophile’s dream 





Maxwell, that gives most concern. 


He was first seen with the pair on holiday in 
Thailand, and was pictured cavorting with 
Ghislaine at a Halloween fetishthemed party in 
Manhattan, 


The photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with 
58-year-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in 
December, when he was joined by other distinguished guests, induding Woody Allen, at a dinner.

A lengthy profie of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was

sentence for offences relating to child prostitution. 


However, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one 
reading The Mail on Sunday's interview with the woman who was prepared fo testify against him can 
be in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges. 


Epstein, a Wail Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his 
friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year 
old girl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an ‘erotic massage’. 


The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at Jeast 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him. 
Eventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors ~ a practice not permitted under British 
law— under which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges. 


Police claim that his donations to politidans and his ‘dream team’ of influential lawyers deterred 
prosecutors from bringing more serious charges of sex-tralicking. The deal certainly kept the names 
of alot of Epstein’s famous friends out of an embarrassing court case. 


However, an unusual part of the agreement was that Epstein’s alleged viclims were allowed to bring 
civil proceedings against him. 


He has so far made 17 out-of-court settlernents, and some cases are ongoing. One of these girls 
was to have been 2 key wilness for ihe prosecution had the case gone to irial. She was just 15 
years old when she was drawn into Epstein's exploitative world in 1998. 


in ber civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102’ she alleged that her duties 
included being ‘sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers including royalty’. 


Now, horrified by the evidence of Epstein and 
Andrew enjoying each other's company in New 
York, Jane Doe 102 has agreed to waive ber 
anonymity and ell for the first time her deeply 
disturbing story. 


Her real name is Virginia Robaris and she now 
lives in Australia, where she is a happily married 
mother of three. 


Over the course of a week during which she 
spoke at length to The Mail on Sunday, she 
appeared sometimes vulnerable, and 
sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute 
and consistent. 


Revisiting evenis from a past that she had 
hoped she had left behind, Virginia occasionally 
buried her face in. her hands. 


Some recollections ~ and, for reasons of taste, 
not all the details can be included here — caused 
her to flush with shame. 'l’m telling you things 
that even my husband didn't know,’ she said. 


Virginia, who has undergone counselling to try 
to come-to terms with her past, is honest about 
her initiation into Epstein’s depraved world. 


She was a troubled teenager, whose slender 
figure, delicate comploxion, hesitant voice and 
soulful blue eyes made her look young for her 
years. 


Bom in Sacramento, California, in August.1983, 
Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch 
an the West Coast of America. 


This seemingly idylic childhood ended when she 
was sexually Molested by a man close to her 
farnily. 


The fallout from that led to her parents 
temporarily splitting up. Blarning herself, Virginia 
began fo get into trouble Aged 71, she was sent 
to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away. 


Living on the streeis, she was beaten up and 
slept with at feast two older men in return for 
food, ‘I was a paedophile’s dream,’ she says. 






Three years tater, she was reunited with her 
family and started a new life with her father who 
had moved to Palm Beach, 


Florida, where he was maintenance manager at 
Donald Trump's country club, Mar-a-Lego. 
Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room 
assistant ~which is where, soon after her 15th 
birthday, she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited 
her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse. 


A new Hite: Virgina, now a mother-of-three, In 
Austral 





‘bwas wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt 
and a skin-light white polo iop ~ when | was approached by Ghislaine, Virginia says. 


4 told her | wanted fo become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman 
who was looking for a tavelling masseuse. 


I'd get training and be paid well. Virginia’s father gave his blessing, beheving his daughter was being 
handed the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable emplayer. 


He drove her io Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also owns a nine-storey 
home in New York, the cily's biggest private residence: a 7,500-ace ranch called Zorro’ in New 
Mexico and Lille Saint James, a private 70- acre atoll in the US Virgin tslands.

Virginia says: ‘Ghisiaine said | was to start immediately and that someone would drive me home. 


My father Jeft and | was told to go upstairs.’ She was led by another woman through Epstein’s 
bedroom into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table. 


He staried {o interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Viginia had no suspicions. 
Presumably, she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business. 


Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer 6 virgin. 


Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had 
shown her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter. 


Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant te deny such important people, My face was red with 
embarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them. 


The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his 
private jet ond have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to 
return the next day. 


That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein. 
For three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18. 






Virginia was fascinated by his life story; the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a 
teacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political, 
financial and academic establishment, 


As a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money. 
He guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an’eratic massage.’ 


Virginia said: ‘| would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad 
he carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me. 


‘And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash, 
Virginia felt even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more 
disturbing role. 


‘Basically, | was training to be a prostitute for him 


and his friends who shared his interest in young Epstei n had trained me 
girls,’ she says: ‘After about two years, he started 


to ask me to “entenain’” his friends.’ to do whatever men 


it started when Epstein called Virginia at the Pam Wanted. I told myself | 
Beach apartment he had rented for her. « 
was special 


She recalls: ‘He sald, “I've got a good friend and} 
need you to fly to the island to- 
entertain him, massage him and make him fee! how you make me feel.” 


He didn’t spell out what | had to do. He didn't have to. ‘He'd trained me to do whatever a man 
warited, | was shocked but } told mysell he was sharing me around because he trusted me and | was 
special, 

i was worried, but ] would do-anything lo keep Jeffrey happy and fo keep my place as his number 
one girl. 

He would keep telling me how lucky | was with the life | was leading and the money | was making. It 
was easy to fall into his grasp. 

“The way Il usually worked was {'d be sent io meet a man on the private Isiand Jefilrey owned in the 
Caribbean. or at his ranch in New Mexico. which was really isolated.’ She was ‘given’ to men ranging 
in age from their 40s fo their 60s. 


They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room). a 
world-renowned scientist, a respecied Sberal politician and a foreign head of state. 

None appeared to think the arrangernent was unusual, Virginia says there were many other girls jn 
Epstein’s circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them. 

‘They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,’ she 
says. ‘But | was one of the very few he trusted as “special” and chosen to “entertain” his friends.” 


Virginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reably. ‘il was an escape drug,’ she 
says. ‘It made me calm and helped me forget about what | had to do, | was up to eight pills a day.’ 


Epstein had no objection te Virginia's use of prescription drugs, no doubi recognising that they made 
her even more malleable. ‘I didn't want to go back to the life I'd had before’ she says.

‘That made me totally obedient.’ Despite the fact 
that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this Efe 
now seemed normal to Virginia. || felt that he 
and Ghislaine really cared for me,’ she sald. 


‘We'd do family things, like watch Sex And The 
City and eat popcorn, ‘A lot of it was very 
glamorous, | met famous friends of his such as 
Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell. 
He introduced me as his “travelling masseuse.” 


Some people mistook me for his daughter. 
“Nhen we were in New York or Palm Beach, 
Ghislaine and | would shop all day, 


Jeffrey bought me jewellery = diamonds were 
his favourite — and wonderful furniture. He was 
paying me very well because I'd give him sex 
whenever he wanted it’ 


She was, she says, delighted when Epstein 
invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip 
in 2001. 


‘He said we'd be going to Europe and North 
Africa to meet architects and interior decorators 
because he wanted to redo his New Mexico 
house, 


| threw my arms around him and gave him a 
peck on the cheek,’ They flewto Paris, then 
Spain, then Tangier. 


Finally, they went to London. ‘After we landed, 
we drove straight to Ghislaine’s house,' says 
Virginia. ‘I was given.a small upstairs bedroom, The following morning, Ghislaine came in. 

She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, “Get up, sleepyhead, You've got a big day. We've 
gat to go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight.” 


‘She sald | needed to be “smiley” and bubbly becatise he was the Queen’s son. 
Ghislaine arid | went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer 


stores where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, 
perfume and make-up, 


We got back to Ghislatne’s house at around 4pm andl ran straight upstairs to shower and dress. 


When E went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door. 
Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. ‘Ghislaine served tea from a 
sno pot and biscuits, She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrews 
‘daughters, 


Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought I was and he guessed 17 and they all laughed. 
Ghislaine made a joke that 1 was getting too old for Jeffrey. 


She said, "He'll soon have fo trade her in.” It was wadely known that he liked young girls.’ The four of 
them went out to dinner and on to Tramp.nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her. 


‘After about an hout-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine’s. 


All of us went upstairs and | asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince, | wanted 
something to show my Mom, Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and laler Andrew left. 


‘In the morning, Ghislaine said, “You did well, He had fun”. We flew straight back to the States.’ The 
Mail on Sunday has confirmed that the tycoon’s jet flew to Paris on March 6, 2001, continuing to 
Granada, Tangier and London, before returning to New York. 


On the last Jeg.of the trip, Virginia was paid about $15,000 (£9,400) by Epstein, ‘It was amazing 
money, more than I'd ever made on a trip with him before, 


He didn’t say there was any special reason, but | felt like I'd done everything he wanted. He was Very

There is no suggestion that there was any sexual

However, the Prince must have been aware of

mansion. 


‘When I got to the mansion, | was told, “Get ready, You are meeting someone in the office” - which

‘The first few months afier | married Robert were the worst,’ she says. ‘I couldn't bring myself to tell 
him much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out. 


‘| felt very alone. | was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiatrist and was on anti-depressants. 


‘ Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned 
by the FBI, 


‘They said they had found photos of me at Jeffrey's Palm Beach house,’ she says, ‘(Epstein had] 
hidden cameras watching me the entire time even when I was in the bathroom, | was so 
embarrassed. 


‘| told the FBI that my true purpose was sexual. They told me everything he did was Illegal because | 
was under age.' (The age of consent in Florida is 18). 


"They sald that if it had to go to trial, they'd need me because Id lived with him and that made me a 
key witness, | was very afraid, because he had so much power, but eventually | agreed to testify, 


| was glad he'd finally been found out. He shoukin't be hurting other girls. Following Epstein’s arrest, 
investigators are believed to have found a list of men’s names on his computer and asked him 
whether they had been ‘treated’ to sexual encounters with his menage of minors. 


‘He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question, 
it could be incriminating,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday, 


Epstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a ‘slap on the wrist’ for him, 
and ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a Eberal work-release programme 
Lawyer Brad Edwards, who represented several of Epstein’s victims, said: ‘Rather than punish him 
the way they would an average Joe, they sent a dear message that with enough money and power 
and influence, the system can be bought,’ 


Virginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings 
bottled up until last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories, 


Virginia says: ‘I am appalled. To me, it’s saying, “We are above the law.” But Jeffrey Is a monster,’ 
Last night, neither Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell nor Prince Andrew would comment on Virginia’s story.

Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine 


Maxwell 


BY DEVONSHIRES SOLICITORS, PRNE 
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2011 


LONDON, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the 


various allegations about her 


that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations 


are all entirely 
false. 


It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal 
representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth 


and asking for 


the allegations to be withdrawn have simply been ignored. 


In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take 


legal action against those newspapers. 


"IT understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is 
well known that certain newspapers live by the adage, "why 


let the truth get 


in the way of a good story." However, the allegations made 


against me are 


abhorrent and entirely untrue and | ask that they stop," said 


Ghislaine 
Maxwell, 


"A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of 


accuracy 


in their reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the 


most 


elementary investigation or any real due diligence. I am now 


taking action to 
clear my name," she said.

JANE DOE 1 and JANE DOE 2, 
Petitioners, 
vs. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 


/ 





ORDER DENYING PETITIONERS’ MOTION TO JOIN UNDER RULE 21 AND 
MOTION TO AMEND UNDER RULE 15 





This cause is before the Court on Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s Corrected Motion 
Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action (“Rule 21 Motion”) (DE 280), and Jane Doe | and Jane 
Doe 2’s Protective Motion Pursuant to Rule 15 to Amend Their Pleadings to Conform to 
Existing Evidence and to Add Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doc 4 as Petitioners (“Rule 15 Motion”) (DE 
311). Both motions are ripe for review. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that they 
should be denied. 

I. Background 

This is an action by two unnamed petitioners, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, seeking to 
prosecute a claim under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771. (DE 1). 
Generally, they allege that the respondent Government violated their rights under the CVRA by 
failing to consult with them before negotiating a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, 
who subjected them to various sexual crimes while they were minors. (Id.). Petitioners initiated 


this action in July 2008. (id.). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 16-1 Filed 12/01/15 Page 13 of 26 


Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 324 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015 Page 2 of 10 


On December 30, 2014, two other unnamed victims, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4, moved 
to join as petitioners in this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. (DE 280). 
Petitioners (Jane Doe | and Jane Doe 2) support the Rule 21 Motion. (Id, at 11). Jane Doe 3 and 
Jane Doe 4 argue that they “have suffered the same violations of their rights under the [CVRA] 
as the” Petitioners, and they “desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.” (Id. at 
1). The Government vehemently opposes joinder under Rule 21. (DE 290). The Government 
argues that Rule 15 is the proper procedural device for adding parties to an action, not Rule 21. 
(Id. at 1). 

“[OJut of an abundance of caution,” Petitioners filed a motion to amend their petition 
under Rule 15, conforming the petition to the evidence and adding Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 as 
petitioners. (DE 311 at 2). The Government opposes the Rule 15 Motion as well. (DE 3 14). 
Among other things, the Government argues that amending the petition to include Jane Doe 3 
and Jane Doe 4 should be denied because of their undue delay in seeking to join the proceedings, 
and the undue prejudice that amendment will cause. (Id.). 

After considering the parties’ submissions and the proposed amended petition, the Court 
finds that justice does not require amendment in this instance and exercises its discretion to deny 
the amendment. 

IJ. Discussion 

“The decision whether to grant leave to amend a complaint is within the sole discretion of 
the district court.” Laurie v. Ala. Ct. Crim. Apps., 256 F.3d 1266, 1274 (11th Cir. 2001). “The 
court should freely give leave when justice so requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Justice does 


not require amendment in several instances, “includ[ing] undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 16-1 Filed 12/01/15 Page 14 of 26 


Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 324 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015 Page 3 of 10 


on the part of the movant, . . . undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the 


amendment, [and] futility of amendment.’” Laurie, 256 F.3d at 1274 (quoting Foman v. Davis, 





371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). In addition to considering the effect of amendment on the parties, the 
court must consider “the importance of the amendment on the proper determination of the merits 
of a dispute.” 6 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P. § 1488, p. 814 3d ed. 2010). Justice does 
not require amendment where the addition of parties with duplicative claims will not materially 
advance the resolution of the litigation on the merits. See Herring v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 894 
F.2d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir. 1989). 

A. Rule 21 Motion 

Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s first attempt to join in this proceeding was brought under 
Rule 21. (DE 280). “If parties seek to add a party under Rule 21, courts generally use the 
standard of Rule 15, governing amendments to pleadings, to determine whether to allow the 
addition.” 12 Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Fed. P., p. 432 (3d ed. 2013); see also Galustian v. 
Peter, 591 F.3d 724, 729-30 (4th Cir. 2010) (collecting cases and noting that Rule 15(a) applies 
to amendments seeking to add parties); Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1365 (10th Cir. 
1993) (“A motion to add a party is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)....”). 

Rule 21, “Misjoinder and Non-joinder of Parties,” provides the court with a tool for 
correcting the “misjoinder” of parties that would otherwise result in dismissal. Fed. R. Civ. P. 
21. Insofar as Rule 21 “relates to the addition of parties, it is intended to permit the bringing in 
of a person, who through inadvertence, mistake or for some other reason, had not been made a 
party and whose presence as a party is later found necessary or desirable.” United States v. Com. 


Bank of N. Am., 31 F.R.D. 133, 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1962) (internal quotation marks omitted). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 16-1 Filed 12/01/15 Page 15 of 26 


Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 324 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015 Page 4 of 10 


In their Rule 21 Motion, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 do not claim that they were omitted 
from this proceeding due to any “inadvertence” or “mistake” by Petitioners; rather, they seek to 
join this proceeding as parties that could have been permissively joined in the original petition 
under Rule 20 (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”). As courts generally use the standards of Rule 
15 to evaluate such circumstances, the Court will consider the joinder issue as presented in the 
Rule 15 Motion.! The Court will consider the arguments presented in the Rule 21 Motion as if 
they are set forth in the Rule 15 Motion as well. Because the arguments are presented in the Rule 
15 Motion (and because the Court is denying the Rule 15 Motion on its merits, as discussed 
below), the Rule 21 Motion will be denied. | 

The Court also concludes that portions of the Rule 21 Motion and related 
filings should be stricken from the record. Pending for this Court’s consideration is a Motion 
for Limited Intervention filed by Alan M. Dershowitz, who seeks to intervene to “strike the 
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and [to] request[] a show cause order to 
the attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). The Court has considered Mr. Dershowitz’s 
arguments, but it finds that his intervention is unnecessary as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
12(f) empowers the Court “‘on its own” to “strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any 
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). 

Petitioners’ Rule 21 Motion consists of relatively little argumentation regarding why the 


Court should permit them to join in this action: they argue that (1) they were sexually abused by 


' The Court notes that, regardless of which motion it considers, the same standard 
governs the addition of parties under Rule 21 and Rule 15. See Goston v. Potter, No. 08-cv-478 
FJS ATB, 2010 WL 4774238, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Universal 
Music Grp., Inc., 248 F.R.D. 408, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)).

Jeffrey Epstein, and (2) the Government violated their CVRA rights by concealing the non- 
prosecution agreement with them. (DE 280 at 3; see id. at 7-8). However, the bulk of the Rule 
21 Motion consists of copious factual details that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “would prove” “[i]f 
allowed to join this action.” (Id. at 3, 7). Specifically, Jane Doe 3 proffers that she could prove 
the circumstances under which a non-party introduced her to Mr. Epstein, and how Mr. Epstein 
sexually trafficked her to several high-profile non-party individuals, “including numerous 
prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known 
Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” (Id. at 3-6). She names several individuals, and she 
offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took place. (See id. at 5). 

At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary to the 
determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted to join Petitioners’ 
claim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding 
with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent 
to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed 
them CVRA duties), especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not 
related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken. 

The original Rule 21 Motion (DE 279) shall be stricken in its entirety, as it is wholly 
superseded by the “corrected” version of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 280). From the corrected Rule 
21 Motion, the Court shall strike all factual details regarding Jane Doe 3 between the following 


sentences: “The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from 


2 Jane Doe 4’s proffer is limited to sexual acts between Mr. Epstein and herself. (See DE 
280 at 7-8). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 16-1 Filed 12/01/15 Page 17 of 26 
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 324 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015 Page 6 of 10 


Jane Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA” (id, at 3); and “The Government was 
well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the 
attachment to the NPA” (id. at 6). As none of Jane Doe 4’s factual details relate to non-parties, 
the Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 2] Motion related to her 
circumstances. Regarding the Declaration in support of Petitioners’ response to Mr. 
Dershowitz’s motion to intervene (DE 291-1), the Court shall strike paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 
15, 19 through 53, and 59, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-parties. Regarding 
the Declaration of Jane Doe 3 in support of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 310-1), the Court shall strike 
paragraphs 7 through 12, 16, 39, and 49, as they contain impertinent details regarding non- 
parties. Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof, 
should Petitioners demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a 
matter presented for the Court’s consideration. 

As mentioned, Mr. Dershowitz moves to intervene “for the limited purposes of moving to 
strike the outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause 
order to the attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). As the Court has taken it upon itself 
to strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 21 Motion and related filings, the Court 
concludes that Mr. Derschowitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary. Accordingly, his 


motion to intervene will be denied as moot.’ Regarding whether a show cause order should 


> This also moots Mr. Dershowitz’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in 
Support of Motion for Limited Intervention. (DE 317). Denying Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to 
intervene also renders moot Petitioners’ motion (DE 292) to file a sealed document supporting its 
response to Mr. Dershowitz’s motion. It will accordingly be denied as moot, and DE 293 (the 
sealed response) will be stricken from the record.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 324 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015 Page 7 of 10 


issue, the Court finds that its action of striking the lurid details from Petitioners’ submissions is 
sanction enough. However, the Court cautions that all counsel are subject to Rule 11’s mandate 
that all submissions be presented for a proper purpose and factual contentions have evidentiary 
support, Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1) and (3), and that the Court may, on its own, strike from any 
pleading “any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter,” Fed. R. Civ... 120): 
B. Rule 15 Motion 

Between their two motions (the Rule 21 Motion and Rule 15 Motion), Jane Doe 3 and 
Jane Doe 4 assert that “they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights [under the 
CVRA] as well.” (DE 280 at 1). Although Petitioners already seek the invalidation of Mr. 
Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement on behalf of all “other similarly-situated victims” (DE 189 
at 1; DE 311 at 2, 12, 15, 18-19), Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 argue that they should be fellow 
travelers in this pursuit, lest they “be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims” resulting 
in “duplicative litigation” (DE 280 at 11). The Court finds that justice does not require adding 
new parties this late in the proceedings who will raise claims that are admittedly “duplicative” of 
the claims already presented by Petitioners. 

The Does’ submissions demonstrate that it is entirely unnecessary for Jane Doe 3 and 
Jane Doe 4 to proceed as parties in this action, rather than as fact witnesses available to offer 
relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative testimony. (See, ¢.g., DE 280 at 2 (Jane Doe 3 and 
Jane Doe 4 “are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims”), 9 (“The new victims 
will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in the same way as it 
violated the rights of the other victims.”), 10 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 “will simply join in 


motions that the current victims were going to file in any event.”), 11 (litigating Jane Doe 3 and 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 16-1 Filed 12/01/15 Page 19 of 26 


Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 324 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015 Page 8 of 10 


Jane Doe 4’s claims would be “duplicative’”); DE 298 at 1 n.1 (“As promised . . . Jane Doe No. 3 
and Jane Doe No. 4 do not seek to expand the number of pleadings filed in this case. If allowed 
to join this action, they would simply support the pleadings already being filed by Jane Doe No. 1 
and Jane Doe No. 2.”); DE 311 at 5 n.3 (“[A]II four victims (represented by the same legal 
counsel) intend to coordinate efforts and avoid duplicative pleadings.”), 15 (Jane Doe 3 and Jane 
Doe 4 “challenge the same secret agreement _i.e., the NPA that the Government executed with 
Epstein and then concealed from the victims. This is made clear by the proposed amendment 
itself, in which all four victims simply allege the same general facts.”)). As the Does argue at 
length in their Rule 15 Motion, Jane Doe 1’s original petition “specifically allege[s] that the 
Government was violating not only her rights but the rights of other similarly-situated victims.” 
(DE 311 at 2). The Court fails to see why the addition of “other similarly-situated victims” is 
now necessary to “vindicate their rights as well.” (DE 280 at 1). 

Of course, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 can participate in this litigated effort to vindicate 
the rights of similarly situated victims _ there is no requirement that the evidentiary proof 
submitted in this case come only from the named parties. Petitioners point out as much, noting 
that, regardless of whether this Court grants the Rule 15 Motion, “they will call Jane Doe No. 3 
as a witness at any trial.” (DE 311 at 17.7). The necessary “participation” of Jane Doe 3 and 
Jane Doe 4 in this case can be satisfied by offering their properly supported and relevant, 
admissible, and non-cumulative testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial 


(see DE 280 at 9) or affidavits submitted to support the relevancy of discovery requests" (see 


‘ The non-party Jane Does clearly understand how to submit affidavits. (See DEs 291-1, 
310-1). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 16-1 Filed 12/01/15 Page 20 of 26 


Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 324 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/07/2015 Page 9 of 10 


id. at 10). Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s “participation in this 
case” can only be achieved by listing them as parties. 

As it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a 
determination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all 
“other similarly situated victims” under the CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer 
relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their 
participation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard. See Herring, 894 F.2d at 1024 
(District court did not abuse its discretion by denying amendment where “addition of more 
plaintiffs... would not have affected the issues underlying the grant of summary judgment.”); cf. 
Arthur v. Stern, 2008 WL 2620116, at *7 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (Under Rule 15, “courts have held 
that leave to amend to assert a claim already at issue in [another lawsuit] should not be granted if 
the same parties are involved, the same substantive claim is raised, and the same relief is 
sought.”).> And, as to Jane Doe 4 at least, adding her as a party raises unnecessary questions 
about whether she is a proper party to this action.° 

Petitioners also admit that amending the petition to conform to the evidence — by 
including references to the non-prosecution agreement itself is “unnecessary” as the “existing 
petition is broad enough to cover the developing evidence in this case.” (DE 311). The Court 

> The Court expresses no opinion at this time whether any of the attestations made by 


Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 in support of their motion will be relevant, admissible, and non- 
cumulative. 


° The Government contends that Jane Doe 4 is not a true “victim” in this case because 
she was not known at the time the Government negotiated the non-prosecution agreement, and 
accordingly she was not entitled to notification rights under the CVRA. (See DE 290 at 10). 
Any “duplicative” litigation filed by Jane Doe 4 would necessarily raise the issue of whether she 
has standing under the CVRA under these circumstances.

Prince Andrew denies having relations with ‘sex slave’ girl 


Buckingham Palace issues an unprecedented statement denying the Duke of York slept with Virgina Roberts, the girl at the centre of the ‘sex 
slave' court case 





By Robert Mendick, and Rob Crilly in New York 


10:49PM GMT 03 Jan 2015 


The Duke of York last night emphatically denied sleeping with the woman at the centre of an alleged sex-slave scandal. 


Prince Andrew had been accused in court documents, lodged in the United States, of sexually abusing a 17-year-old girl, Virginia Roberts, who was allegedly 
supplied to him by friend and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. 


But in an unprecedented statement, Buckingham Palace, insisted that the claims were categorically untrue. 


Following a day of bruising headlines, a spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: “Tt is emphatically denied that HRH The Duke of York had any form of 
sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. The allegations made are false and without any foundation.” 


Lawyers acting for the Duke of York have privately accused Mrs Roberts of embarking on a “speculative fishing expedition” in an attempting to ensnare him 


in the under-age sex scandal. 


As well as accusing him of having slept with her, papers lodged by her Jegal team, go on to accuse the Prince of lobbying the US authorities (o ensure Epstein 


was given a “more favourable plea” bargain following a series of sex abuse allegations against him. 
In 2008, Epstein was jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to one state charge of soliciting prostitution. Several other charges were dropped. 


Mrs Roberts’ lawyers are now seeking “documents regarding Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the government to give him a more favourable plea 


arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince Andrew.” 
The Telegraph can disclose that lawyers acting for the Duke of York have examined the 13-page motion submitted in the Florida courts. 


It is understood the lawyers view the claim of lobbying as “a speculative fishing expedition”. They are understood to believe that her lawyers do not have proof 


that lobbying was conducted by the Prince, but want to see if any paperwork that supports such a claim actually exists. 


On Friday Buckingham Palace took the highly unusual step of “categorically” denying the allegations made by the woman — who at that stage was only 


identified as Jane Doe 3 in the court documents. 
The initial statement read: “Any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue.” 


But Palace officials last night decided to go further still and meet the scandal head with a statement that not only addressed the issue of sex, but also named the 


complainant. 


Attempts to shore up the Prince’s reputation were helped by an interview given by Alan Dershowitz. the Harvard law professor and criminal defence lawyer 
who represented Epstein. Mr Dershowitz has also been accused by Jane Doe 3 of having “sexual relations” with her “on numerous occasions while she was a 


minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico. and the US Virgin Islands”. 
Mr Dershowitz told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the claims against him were false. He said: “My only feeling is if she’s lied about me, which I know to

41/30/2015 Prince Andrew denies having relations with 'sex slave’ girl - Telegraph 


an absolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone else. We know she’s lied about other public figures including a former prime minister 
and others who she claims to have participated in sexual activities with, so I think it must be presumed all her allegations against Prince Andrew were false as 


well.” 


Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of Robert Maxwell, also denied allegations that she had acted as a “madame for Epstein” and “facilitated Prince Andrew's 


acts of sexual abuse”. Her spokesman said: “The allegations made against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. 


“Miss Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek 


redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.” 


Ina statement released through her lawyers to The Guardian, the alleged victim responded to the denials. “These types of aggressive attacks on me are exactly 


the reason why sexual abuse victims typically remain silent,” she said. “I’m not going to be bullied back into silence.”

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 


VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 


PLAINTIFF, : 
V. 15-cv-07433-RWS 


GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 


DEFENDANT. 


MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR A STAY OF 
DISCOVERY PENDING DECISION ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS 


Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through her attorney Laura A. Menninger of the law firm 
Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C., hereby respectfully submits this Memorandum of Law in 
support of her Motion to Stay Discovery during the pendency of her Motion to Dismiss. 


LEGAL STANDARD 


Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure grants courts broad discretion to stay 
discovery “for good cause shown.” Spencer Trask Software and Info. Servs., LLC v. RPost Int'l 
Ltd., 206 F.R.D. 367, 368 (S.D.N.Y 2002). Good cause may be shown where a party (1) has 
filed a dispositive motion; (2) the stay is for a short period of time; and (3) the opposing party 
will not be prejudiced by the stay. Jd. Additional factors courts may consider are breadth of 
discovery sought and the burden of responding to it as well as the strength of the dispositive 


motion forming the basis for the stay application. Id. 


ARGUMENT 


I. Ms. Maxwell’s Motion to Dismiss Provides “Good Cause” to Stay Discovery 
A. The Pending Motion Cites Multiple, Independent Grounds for Dismissal 


A stay of discovery is particularly appropriate where, as here, a pending motion to 
dismiss has “substantial arguments for dismissal of many, if not all, of the claims asserted.” 
Spinelli v. National Football League, No. 13-cv-7398 (RWS), 2015 WL 7302266, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2015) (Sweet, J.). Here, Plaintiff's Complaint consists of a single 
defamation claim. In her motion to dismiss, Ms. Maxwell offers multiple grounds for dismissal 
of the entire action, none of which are “unfounded in the law.” Johnson v. New York Univ. Sch. 
of Educ., 205 F.R.D. 433, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Ms. Maxwell respectfully refers the Court to 
her Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss wherein she argues as grounds for 
dismissal both that the Complaint has various pleading deficiencies and that the alleged 
defamatory statements are protected by not one, but two, applicable privileges. Courts in this 
district have stayed discovery under similar circumstances. See e.g., Integrated Sys. and Power, 
Inc. v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., No. 09 CV 5874 (RPP), 2009 WL 2777076, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 
2009) (“granting a stay upon noting that [defendant] has put forth in its motion multiple, 
independent arguments for dismissal...”). 

While the Court will ultimately decide the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s motion, the presence 
of multiple, independent grounds for dismissal, warrants a stay of discovery. 


B. The Requested Stay is for a Short Period of Time 


Pursuant to Rule 6.1(b) of the Local Rules of this Court, briefing on the Motion to 
Dismiss is scheduled to be completed on Monday, December 28. Accordingly, any delay in the 
commencement of discovery will last for the time it takes the Court to rule on the Motion to 


Dismiss. Such a short stay is unlikely to prejudice the Plaintiff. See id. When balanced against 


the breadth of discovery required in this case, as detailed below, considerations of judicial 
efficiency weigh in favor of a stay. Jd. (granting a stay upon noting that doing so “could avoid 
the need for costly and time-consuming discovery”). 


C. The Nature of the Complaint Necessarily Calls for a Wide-Breadth of 
Discovery 


The allegations in the Complaint raise factual questions that stretch across multiple 
decades, from as early as 1999 to the present, and involve hundreds of individuals. Compl. { 9. 
Discovery, therefore, necessarily will be burdensome. Lengthy discovery is inherent in 
defamation actions because it is well-settled that in any such claim, “truth is an absolute, 
unqualified defense.” Jewell v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 23 F. Supp.2d 348, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 1998). 
Here, because the alleged defamatory statements consist of Ms. Maxwell’s denial of the multiple, 
and complex allegations levied against her by the Plaintiff concerning events that allegedly 
occurred 17 years ago, a wide breadth of discovery will be needed to address the veracity of each 
allegation. The sheer number of depositions that will be required alone will be a tremendous 
burden on the parties’ resources. This Court has granted a stay of discovery in a recent case 
involving similarly complex factual questions. Spinelli, 2015 WL 7302266, at *2. 

Plaintiff's Rule 26 disclosures and First Request for Production of Documents to 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell amply illustrate this point. In her Rule 26 disclosures, Plaintiff 
lists as potential witnesses 94 individuals and four categories of people, such as “all staff at the 
Mar-a-Largo Club during 1999.” As to the 94 individuals, she provides one phone number for 
one witness and counsel’s contact information for two witnesses and the two parties. The 
remaining 89 individuals’ addresses and phone numbers are “unknown at this time.” 

In her First Request for Production of Documents, Plaintiff seeks records from the 


“period of July 1999 to the present” of broad categories such as: 


e All documents relating to your travel from the period 1999 — present,” (No. 8); 


e All computers, hard drives or copies thereof for all computers in operation 
between 1999 — 2002,” (No. 16); 


e All telephone records associated with you, including cell phone records from 
1999 — present.” (No. 21); 


e All documents relating to calendars, schedules or appointments for you from 1999 
— present,” (No. 22). 


See Motion for Stay, Ex. A. Given the strength of Ms. Maxwell’s Motion to Dismiss, the burden 
of responding to such expansive requests is unjustifiable. 


I. In the Alternative, Ms. Maxwell Requests Additional Time to Respond to Plaintiff’s 
Discovery Requests. 


In the alternative, if this Court declines to grant an order staying discovery, for the same 
reasons stated above, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests additional time within which to respond 
and/or object to Plaintiff's First Request for Production of Documents to Defendant Ghislaine 
Maxwell, served on October 27, 2015. The original date by which Ms. Maxwell was to respond 
to Plaintiff's First Request for Production is today, November 30, 2015. Ms. Maxwell has not 
made any previous requests for an extension of this deadline. Counsel for the Plaintiff has 
neither consented nor refused consent to this request. Finally, this extension will not affect any 
other scheduled dates. 

CONCLUSION 

As detailed above, good cause exists to justify a stay of discovery pending Ms. 
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss. The motion is dispositive and well founded in law, the stay is of 
short duration, and the expected discovery is broad and burdensome. For these reasons, Ms. 
Maxwell respectfully requests that this Court stay discovery in this action until this Court reaches 
its decision on the motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, that Ms. Maxwell be granted 


additional time to respond and/or object to Plaintiffs First Request for Production. 


Dated: November 30, 2015.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 6 of 26 


Plaintiff, Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files this 
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay, and in support thereof, states as follows: 

I. BACKGROUND 

This is a single-count defamation case, turning on whether Defendant defamed Ms. 
Giuffre by calling her a liar when Ms. Giuffre publicly reported the sexual abuse she suffered as 
a minor child. Ms. Giuffre has propounded narrowly tailored discovery that goes to the heart of 
the defamation, but rather than respond, Defendant has moved for a stay of all discovery pending 
her Motion to Dismiss. 

Defendant’s public, defamatory attack on Ms. Giuffre is an unabashed effort to bully this 
sexual assault victim into silence. This is an old story. Defendant is calling Ms. Giuffre a “liar” 
to deflect attention from her own conduct. Defendant’s main argument is that discovery should 
be stayed because Defendant will be successful on her Motion to Dismiss as her defamatory 
statements are protected by certain qualified privileges. The case law is clear that the qualified 
privileges do not apply if a speaker deliberately published a false defamatory statement or if the 
statements are outside the scope of the qualified privilege because their purpose was to bully, 
harass, and intimidate. Ms. Giuffre is entitled to discovery to prove that not only were the 
Defendant’s defamatory statements false, but also that she knew they were false. 

The publicly-available information convincingly proves that Defendant’s statement that 
she was not involved in the abuse of Ms. Giuffre is false. Overwhelming evidence — including 
documents, witness testimony, and even photographs of Defendant - not only clearly corroborate 
Ms. Giuffre’s report of the sex abuse, but also, importantly, show Defendant’s deep and 


persistent participation. And obviously, because Defendant herself was helping orchestrate the 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 7 of 26 


sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre, her statements attacking Ms. Giuffre were not negligently uttered 
but deliberately made. 

The evidence begins with the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida identified Ms. Giuffre as a sexual 
assault victim of Jeffrey Epstein. See Declaration of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 1, 
Government’s September 9, 2008 Victim Notification Letter. Indeed, Epstein entered into a non- 
prosecution agreement with the federal authorities obligating him to pay restitution for his crimes 
against Ms. Giuffre. That agreement also protected any “co-conspirators” from prosecution. 

The remaining question, then, is whether the Defendant was involved in this sexual 
abuse. Again, publicly-available evidence (well known to Defendant) reveals that she was at the 
heart of Epstein’s sex trafficking. Defendant cannot dispute that she recruited Ms. Giuffre at the 
young age of fifteen (15) to come “massage” Jeffrey Epstein at his Palm Beach mansion. 
Publicly available flight logs from convicted pedophile’ Jeffrey Epstein’s private jets show the 
Defendant flying close to 360 times and at least 20 of those fights were with Jeffrey Epstein and 
Ms. Giuffre, when she was a minor child’. See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Composite Exhibit 
2, Flight Logs from Jeffrey Epstein’s Plane.° 

While the Defendant attempts to argue that this victim’s claims are unbelievable because 
she is accusing prominent and wealthy people of sexual abuse, the Defendant provides no 


explanation for why she had Ms. Giuffre, who was a minor child at the time, in the Defendant’s 


' Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal case numbers were 2006-cf-009454A XX XMB and 2008-cf- 
009381 AXXXMB. 


* Over 30 underage victims of Jeffrey Epstein gave statements to the Palm Beach police during their 
investigations. One female stated she was recruited to come to Jeffrey Epstein’s home by Ghislaine 

Maxwell. See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Composite Exhibit 5, Palm Beach Police Reports dated 
March 14, 2005 and July 28, 2006. 


* Only a fraction of Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet flight logs are publically available making these numbers 
simply a snapshot of the actual flights. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 8 of 26 


London home, late at night with Prince Andrew’s arm wrapped around her bare waist — all 
shown with the Defendant smiling in the background. Despite the photographic evidence 
corroborating Ms. Giuffre’s account, Defendant is quick to publicly denounce Ms. Giuffre — a 
liar. See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 3 (picture of Prince Andrew, Ghislaine Maxwell 
and Virginia Roberts Giuffre 17 years old at the time of the picture); see also Decl. of Sigrid 
McCawley at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 200 - 202 (testimony 
regarding the close connection between Defendant Maxwell, Prince Andrew and Jeffrey 
Epstein). 

During the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, certain household staff were deposed. 
Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Jeffrey Epstein’s household manager, testified that the Defendant 
frequently stayed in Jeffrey Epstein’s home and assisted with bringing in young girls to act as 
“masseuses”’ for Jeffrey Epstein. 

Q. “Okay. Going back to where we started here was, does Ghislaine Maxwell have 
knowledge of the girls that would come over to Jeffrey Epstein’s house that are in 
roughly the same age group as C. and T. (minor children) and to have a good time as 
you put it? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And what was her involvement and/or knowledge about that? 

A. She knew what was going on.” 

See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 176- 
177. See also Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Depo Tr. 
at 96-101 (noting that high school age girls come to the home where Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. 
Maxwell reside). Juan Alessi, another household employee, also testified that young girls were 
regularly present at Jeffrey Epstein’s home where Ghislaine Maxwell resides. See Decl. of 
Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 6, Juan Alessi September 8, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 10-18, 21-23. 


Specifically, Juan Alessi informed the Palm Beach Police Detective as follows: “Alessi stated 


that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked 


3 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 9 of 26 


how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at most.” 
(emphasis added.) See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Composite Exhibit 5, Palm Beach Police 
Incident Report at p. 57. 

On November 21, 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department took a sworn statement from 
house employee Juan Alessi in which he revealed that girls would come over to give “massages” 
and he observed Ms. Maxwell going upstairs in the direction of the bedroom quarters. See Decl. 
of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 7, November 21, 2005 Sworn Statement at 10. He also testified 
that after the massages, he would clean up sex toys that were kept in “Ms. Maxwell’s closet.” Jd. 
at 12-13. He added that he and his wife were concerned with what was going on at the house (/d. 
at 14) and that he observed girls at the house, including one named “Virginia.” Jd. at 21. 

Defendant also had naked pictures of girls performing sexual acts on her computer 
according to Mr. Rodriguez. See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez 
August 7, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 311-312. 

Q. “Did they appear to be doing any sexual? 

A. Yes, ma’am. 

Q. And in these instances were there girls doing sexual things with other girls? 

A. Yes, ma’am. 

Q. And I’m still talking about the pictures on Ms. Maxwell’s computer. 

A. Yes, ma’am.” 

Upon leaving his employment, Rodriguez testified that Defendant threatened him that he should 
not tell anyone about what happened at the house: 

A. “T have to say something. Mrs. Maxwell called me and told me not to ever discuss or 

contact her again in a threaten(ing) way. 

Q. When was this? 

A. Right after I left because I call one of the friends for a job and she told me this, but, 

you know, I feel intimidated and so I want to keep her out... 

Q. She made a telephone call to you and what precisely did she say? 

A. She said I forbid you that you’re going to be — that I will be sorry if I contact any of 

her friends again...She said something like don’t open your mouth or something like 


that. I’m a civil humble, I came as an immigrant to service people, and right now you 
feel a little -I’m 55 and I’m afraid. First of all, I don’t have a job, but I’m glad this is

on tape because I don’t want nothing to happen to me. This is the way they treat you, 
better do this and you shut up and don’t talk to nobody and— 

Q. When you say this is the way they treat, who specifically are you talking about when 

you say that word they? 

A. Maxwell. ” 

See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 169 — 
172, 

This is not the first time Defendant has tried to avoid discovery about her conduct. 
Notably, in 2009, an attorney representing some of Epstein’s sexual abuse victims served 
Defendant Maxwell with a subpoena for a deposition in a civil case against Jeffrey Epstein. 
After extensive discussion and coordinating a convenient time and place, as well as ultimately 
agreeing to a confidentiality agreement prepared by Defendant’s then attorney, at the eleventh 
hour Maxwell’s attorney informed the victims’ attorney that Maxwell’s mother was very ill and 
that consequently Maxwell was leaving the country with no plans to return. The deposition was 
cancelled. Yet a short time later, Maxwell was photographed at a high-profile wedding in 
Rhinebeck, New York, confirming the suspicion that she was indeed still in the country and 
willing to say virtually anything in order to avoid her deposition. See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley 
at Composite Exhibit 8, Maxwell Deposition Notice; Subpoena and Cancellation Payment 
Notice, and January 13, 2015 Daily Mail Article. 

Simply put, given the mountain of evidence proving that the Defendant was heavily 
involved in Epstein’s sex trafficking — and evaded answering questions about her involvement — 


she is not entitled to any delay in the normal litigation process. There is no basis to grant 


Defendant a stay of discovery.

I. ARGUMENT 


A. Defendant Has Not Met Her Burden To Show Good Cause For A Stay In 
Discovery. 


Defendant’s main argument is that a stay should be granted because she believes she will 
be successful in dismissing Ms. Giuffre’s defamation claim. If that were the standard, then 
discovery in every civil case would be stayed at the commencement of the action until the court 
ruled on the motion to dismiss because virtually all defendants in civil cases believe their 
motions to dismiss will be successful. Of course, Defendant’s far-fetched position is not the law. 
See Usov v. Lazar, No. 13 CIV. 818 (RWS), 2013 WL 3199652, at *8 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. June 
25, 2013) (citing Moran v. Flaherty, No. 92 Civ. 3200, 1992 WL 276913, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 
25, 1992)) (“[D]iscovery should not be routinely stayed simply on the basis that a motion to 
dismiss has been filed;”...“‘had the Federal Rules contemplated that a motion to dismiss under 
FRCP 12(b)(6) would [automatically] stay discovery, they would contain a provision.”’). 

Defendant has not met her burden of showing good cause to justify a stay of discovery 
pending a ruling on her motion to dismiss.’ “The pendency of a dispositive motion is not an 
automatic ground for a stay’; instead, courts consider three factors: (1) whether a defendant has 
made a strong showing that the plaintiff's claim is unmeritorious, (2) the breadth of discovery 
and the burden of responding to it, and (3) the risk of unfair prejudice to the party opposing the 


stay.” Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League, No. 13 CIV. 7398 (RWS), 2015 WL 7302266, at *2 


* A party seeking a protective order has the burden to establish that such an order it warranted, showing 
good cause. See Bank of New York v. Meridien Biao Bank Tanzania Ltd., 171 F.R.D. 135, 143 (S.D.N.Y. 
1997); Salgado v. City of New York, No. 00 CIV. 3667 (RWS), 2001 WL 88232, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 
2001). 


> “It, of course, is black letter law that the mere filing of a motion to dismiss the complaint does not 
constitute ‘good cause’ for the issuance of a discovery stay.” Barrett v. Forest Labs., Inc., No. 12-CV- 
5224 (RA), 2015 WL 4111827, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2015) (citing Chesney v. Valley Stream Union 
Free Sch. Dist. No. 24, 236 F.R.D. 113, 115 (E.D.N.Y. 2006)).

(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2015) (citing Morien v. Munich Reins. Am., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 65, 66-67 (D. 
Conn. 2010); Josie-Delerme v. Am. Gen. Fin. Corp., No. 08 Civ. 3166, 2009 WL 497609, at *1 
(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2009)).° Defendant has not met her burden as to any aspect of this test. 


B. Ms. Giuffre’s Claim Is Meritorious And Defendant Has Not Made An 
Adequate Showing To Defeat The Claim. 


Of course, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court must take all allegations in the 
Complaint as true. Worldhomecenter.com, Inc. v. M.J. Resurrection, Inc., (Sweet, J.) No. 11 
CIV. 3371 (RWS), 2012 WL 12922, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2012) (citing Mills v. Polar 
Molecular Corp., 12 F.3d 1170, 1174 (2d Cir.1993)). Taking the allegations here as true, 
Defendant does not, and cannot, show that Ms. Giuffre’s claim is unmeritorious. Ms. Giuffre has 
properly alleged a simple claim for defamation based on Defendant publically proclaiming that 
Ms. Giuffre is a “liar” when Ms. Giuffre reported her sexual abuse. While Defendant has tried to 
muddy the waters by raising privilege claims, those privileges do not save the Defendant. 
Defendant argues that two privileges protect her defamatory statements: (1) the “self-defense” 
privilege and (2) the “pre-litigation” privilege. But both of those privileges are qualified 
privileges, which disappear in situations where a speaker has published statements knowing they 
were false or when they were made to bully, harass and intimate, respectively. Here, Defendant 
has not only made defamatory statements which were plainly false, but also made the statements 
with the malicious intent to ruin the reputation of this sexual assault victim. Because Ms. 
Giuffre’s complaint repeatedly and specifically alleges that Defendant has knowingly lied about 
Ms. Giuffre, the Motion to Dismiss is frivolous. 

° The cases Defendant cites to support her stay are readily distinguished. For example, Defendant relies 
on Integrated Sys. And Power Inc. v. Honeywell Int’l Inc., No. 09 CV 5874 (RPP), 2009 WL 2777076 at 
*1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2009) for the proposition that the Court should grant a stay, yet that case involved a 


number of complicated antitrust claims against multiple distributors which would require extensive 
discovery. This case involves a single defamation claim between two individuals.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 13 of 26 


1. The Qualified “Self Defense” Privilege Does Not Protect The Publication Of 
Deliberately False Statements. 


As will be explained fully in the Opposition to Maxwell’s Motion to Dismiss, the “self- 
defense” privilege does not protect the Defendant for a number of reasons. Most fundamentally, 
the self-defense privilege is inapplicable because Ms. Giuffre has alleged that Defendant made 
not only false and defamatory statements, but did so deliberately. See, e.g., Complaint, ¥ 8 
(“Maxwell made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely false. 
Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest degree of 
awareness of falsity.”) This allegation alone defeats the application of the privilege.’ As the 
Second Circuit has made clear, even if a qualified privilege otherwise applies, it “is nevertheless 
‘forfeited if the defendant steps outside the scope of the privilege and abuses the occasion.’” 
Weldy v. Piedmont Airlines, Inc., 985 F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting Harris v. Hirsh, 161 
A.D.2d 452, 453, 55 N.Y.S. 2d 735, 737 (1st Dep’t 1990) which quoted Prosser and Keeton on 
Torts §115, at 832 (Sth ed. 1984); see also Mirabella v. Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc., Case. 
No. 01 Civ. 5563 (BSJ), 2003 WL 21146657, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2003) (court refusing to 
dismiss slander claim as premature based on assertion of qualified privilege); see also Rodney 
A. Smolla, Vol. 1, Law of Defamation § 8:63, 8:64 (2d ed. 2014); Robert D. Sack, Sack on 
Defamation: Libel, Slander, and Related Problems § 9.3 and § 9.3.1 (4th ed. 2015); Restatement 
(Second) of Torts §§ 600, 605 (1977). 

In Weldy, the Second Circuit explained that a Plaintiff may defeat an assertion of a 
qualified privilege by demonstrating abuse of the privilege “by proving that the defendant acted 


(1) with common law malice, or (2) outside the scope of the privilege, or (3) with knowledge that 


’ The case law also makes clear that a decision on a qualified privilege would be premature at the Motion 
to Dismiss stage. See Teichner v. Bellan, 7 A.D. 2d 247, 252, 181 N.Y.S. 2d 842 (1959); See also 
Kermichi v. Weissman, 125 A.D. 3d 142, 159, 1 N.Y.S. 3d 169, 182 (N.Y. App. Div. 2014). Accordingly, 
there is no basis for staying discovery based on the assertion of a qualified privilege. 


8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 14 of 26 


the statement was false or with a reckless disregard as to its truth.” /d. at 62. Defendant’s 
assertion of a privilege will also be defeated if the defamatory statement was made “in 
furtherance of an improper purpose.” /d. Here, Ms. Giuffre’s Complaint repeatedly alleges that 
not only was Defendant’s statement false, but also that she made the statement with malice and 
knowledge of its falsity. Accordingly, the Defendant’s motion to dismiss based on a claim of 
qualified “self-defense” privilege must be denied. 


2. The Qualified Pre-Litigation Privilege Does Not Protect Mass Publication Of 





Deliberately False Statements For The Purpose Of Harassment. 


Defendant fares no better in asserting the “pre-litigation” privilege. As with the “self- 
defense privilege,” the privilege is (at most) a qualified privilege. And, like the self-defense 
privilege, at the motion to dismiss stage, the privilege disappears in the face of a well-pleaded 
allegation that the statement is not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation and, instead, the 
Defendant has deliberately published the false statements for improper purposes, outside the 
scope of the privilege. See Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 24 N.Y. 3d 713, 719-20 (2015) (“To ensure that 
such [pre-litigation] communications are afforded sufficient protection the privilege should be 
qualified... This requirement ensures that the privilege does not protect attorneys who are 
seeking to bully, harass, or intimidate their client’s adversaries by threatening baseless litigation 
or by asserting wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law or fact, in violation of counsel’s 
ethical obligations.”); See also Rodney A. Smolla, Vol. 1, Law of Defamation § 8:63; 8:64; (2d 
ed. 2014); Robert D. Sack, Sack on Defamation: Libel, Slander, and Related Problems § 9.3 and 
§ 9.3.1; (4th ed. 2015); Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 600, 605 (1977). Simply put, 
Defendant’s statements are outside the scope of the qualified pre-litigation privilege because they 
were not made pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation, but, instead, were made to bully, 


harass, and intimidate the Defendant. Here, the 2015 actionable statement calling Ms. Giuffre’s 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 15 of 26 


claims “obvious lies” was issued by Maxwell’s press agent, Ross Gow, to the media for national 
and international publication. New York courts have only extended the pre-litigation qualified 
privilege to communications among counsel and parties directly discussing issues related to 
anticipated litigation, and Defendant cites to no case in which courts have extended this qualified 
privilege to a press agent who issues a press release. Defendant’s motion to dismiss on this 
ground is, accordingly, without merit and provides no basis for a stay of discovery. 

3. The Complaint Properly Alleges Defamatory Statements. 

Defendant’s motion to dismiss also argues that “‘/v/iewed in context,” the statements are 
not actionable. Here again, at the motion to dismiss stage, such an argument is frivolous. To 
prevail on her motion to dismiss, the Defendant would have to show that, as matter of law, the 
“context” of the allegations rendered them non-defamatory. But to prevail on a claim of 
“context”, the Defendant would have to show a fully developed factual record. Of course, that is 
impossible at this early stage of the proceedings. 

Moreover, Ms. Giuffre has properly alleged that the context of the statements proves a 
defamatory statement. The Complaint, for example, alleges that “Maxwell’s false statements 
directly stated and also implied that in speaking out against sex trafficking Giuffre acted with 
fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task.” § 12. In addition, the Complaint alleges, 
“Maxwell’s false statements directly and indirectly indicate that Giuffre lied about being 
recruited by Maxwell and sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell’s false statements 
were reasonably understood by many persons who read her statements as conveying that specific 
intention and meaning.” § 12. And the Complaint alleges, “Maxwell’s false statements were 
reasonably understood by many persons who read those statements as making specific factual 


claims that Ms. Giuffre was lying about specific facts.” § 14. In the teeth of these specific 


10 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 16 of 26 


allegations about context (never discussed by the Defendant), the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss 
is — once again — frivolous. 

The Motion to Dismiss is frivolous for other reasons as well. Defendant argues that Ms. 
Giuffre failed to allege defamation per se yet this is belied by the face of the Complaint. The 
Complaint alleges that the Defendant’s false statements “also constitute libel per se inasmuch as 
they intended to injure Ms. Giuffre in her professional capacity as the president of a non-profit 
corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her 
credibility and reputation among members of the community that seek her help and that she 
seeks to serve.” Complaint § 11. See Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enterprises Inc., 209 F. 3d 163, 
179 (2d Cir. 2000) (“a writing which tends to disparage a person in the way of his office, 
profession or trade is defamatory per se and does not require proof of special damages.”) 
(Emphasis original, quotations and citations omitted). 

Defendant’s argument that her statement is not defamatory because it is a “mere denial” 
is also flatly contradicted by the prevailing case law. Indeed, the case law makes quite clear that 
the Defendant’s public accusation that Ms. Giuffre lied about her sexual abuse goes beyond a 
“mere denial” and, therefore, properly alleges a defamatory meaning. In McNamee v. Clemens, 
762 F. Supp. 2d 584, 601-602 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) the court held that “denials coupled with 
accusations that the accuser will be proven a liar and has lied in front of members of Congress 
cross the line from general denial to specific accusations reasonably susceptible of a defamatory 
meaning,” because “some of Clemens’ statements branding McNamee a liar contain the 
‘actionable implication that [Clemens] knows certain facts, unknown to his audience, which 
support his opinion.’” Jd., 762 F. Supp. 2d at 601. Accordingly, “[a]n attack on a person's 


integrity by impugning his character as dishonest or immoral may form the basis of a defamation 


11 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 17 of 26 


if an ordinary listener would tend to credit the statements as true.” Jd. at 602. Here, Defendant 
has attacked Ms. Giuffre’s integrity, calling her dishonest and a “liar,” implying that Defendant 
knows certain facts unknown to her audience that support her opinion, and an ordinary listener 
would tend to credit these accusations of lying as true because Defendant knew Ms. Giuffre 
personally at the time of the alleged abuse. 

It is well established under New York law and in the Second Circuit that falsely calling a 
person a liar is defamatory and not subject to a motion to dismiss. See Edwards v. Natn’l 
Audubon Soc., Inc. 556 F, 2d 113, 121-22 (2d Cir. 1977) (“The appellees were charged with 
being “paid to lie”. It is difficult to conceive of any epithet better calculated to subject a scholar 
to the scorn and ridicule of his colleagues than “paid liar.” It is this completely foundationless 
accusation of venality that constitutes the essence of the calumny against the appellees.”); Seung 
Jin Lee v. Tai Chul Kim, 16 Misc. 3d 1118(A), 847 N.Y.S.2d 899 (Sup. Ct. 2007) (denying a 
motion to dismiss when the defendant stated that plaintiff “is a liar; she tried to cover all the 
truth; how could she serve the Lord with lies; and she and her followers are satanic”’); Brach v. 
Congregation Yetev Lev D'Satmar, Inc., 265 A.D. 2d 360, 360-61, 696 N.Y.S. 2d 496, 498 (2d 
Dep't 1999) (reversing an order of dismissal and reinstating defamation action based upon a 
publication stating that a court action was won “by lies and deceit,” finding that the statements at 
issue were actionable statements of “mixed opinion,” and noting that they suggested to the 
average reader that they were supported by some unknown facts); Kaminester v. Weintraub, 131 
A.D. 2d 440, 441, 516 N.Y.S. 2d 234, 234 (1987) (“inasmuch as the defendant Dr. Weintraub 
accused the plaintiff of personal dishonesty, the allegedly libelous statements are not 
constitutionally protected expressions of opinion”); Mase v. Reilly, 206 A.D. 434, 436, 201 


N.Y.S. 470, 472 (App. Div. 1923) (“The charge that a man is lying, at least, in a matter of public 


12 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 18 of 26 


interest, is such a charge as tends to hold him up to scorn, as matter of law, and prima facie a 
complaint stating the making in writing of such a charge is good.”). 

Indeed, just last year, the New York Court of Appeals addressed a case with facts 
strikingly similar to this one. In Davis v. Boeheim, 24 N.Y. 3d 262, 22 N.E. 3d 999 (2014), 
plaintiffs were victims of sexual molestation by Bernie Fine, a former associate head basketball 
coach for Syracuse University. Following plaintiffs accusations of sex abuse, James Boeheim, 
Fine’s friend and another Syracuse Basketball coach, made statements to ESPN.com calling 
plaintiffs liars. Plaintiffs filed a suit for defamation for those and other statements made by 
Boeheim and published by the media. 

The lower court granted a motion to dismiss on the basis that the statements were non- 
actionable opinion because a reasonable reader would conclude that the statements were biased 
personal opinion. But the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the complaint was sufficient 
to survive a motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the Boeheim court held that “[t]here is a reasonable 
view of the claims upon which [plaintiffs] would be entitled to recover for defamation; therefore 
the complaint must be deemed to sufficiently state a cause of action.” Jd. at 274. 

Similarly, Defendant asserted readily understood facts, not opinion, by falsely stating the 
alleged “fact” that Ms. Giuffre’s accusations of sexual abuse are lies, an allegation that is capable 
of being proven true or false. As we know, this is a specific allegation in the Complaint. See 
Complaint, § 14 (“Maxwell specifically directed her false statements at Giuffre’s true public 
description of factual events, and many persons who read Defendant’s statements reasonably 
understood that those statements referred directly to Ms. Giuffre’s account of her life as a young 
teenager with Maxwell and Epstein.”). Also, similarly, given the close relationship between 


Defendant and Epstein, and that Defendant knew Ms. Giuffre from the time when she was a 


13 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 19 of 26 


child victim, the circumstances signal that what is being read is likely to be fact. Accordingly, 
upon any reasonable view of the stated facts, plaintiff would be entitled to recovery for 
defamation, and therefore, the complaint must be deemed to sufficiently state a cause of action. 

Defendant also attempts to rely on the alleged fact that her press release from 2011 was 
directed at the British Press as a threat that litigation could be forthcoming. Defendant 
obfuscates the fact, however, that Ms. Giuffre’s defamation claim alleges a direct attack on Ms. 
Giuffre’s character in 20/5 — a separate attack and apart from any four-year-old theoretical 
threats to the British press. As specifically recounted in the Complaint, the Defendant’s 2015 
attack on Ms. Giuffre included this statement: 

The Allegations made...against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The Original 

allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 

Each time the story is retold it changes, with new salacious details about public 

figures. (The woman’s) claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and 

not publicized as news as they are defamatory. Ghislaine Maxwell’s original 

response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same. Miss Maxwell 

strongly denies allegations of any unsavory nature, which have appeared in the 

British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition 

of such claims.” 

(Emphasis added to mirror statements set forth in paragraph 30 of the Complaint). 

Nor is any merit to Defendant’s claim that the Complaint allegations are deficient. 
Defendant does not deny making the statements, and Ms. Giuffre has adequately pled all of the 
elements of a defamation claim with particularity and supporting facts. First, she has pled a 
defamatory statement concerning another: Defendant stated, through her press agent, that Ms. 
Giuffre’s reports of her child sexual abuse were “obvious lies.” Complaint at 30. Second, she 
has pled publication to third parties, stating that Defendant’s agent “issued an additional false 


statement to the media and public,” and to “a reporter on a Manhattan street.” Jd. at § 30, 4 37. 


Third, Ms. Giuffre has alleged more than “fault amounting to at least negligence on the part of 


14 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 20 of 26 


the publisher.” Indeed, Ms. Giuffre has specifically alleged malice. Among other similar 
allegations, the Complaint states: “Maxwell’s statements were published intentionally for the 
malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual abuse and sexual trafficking victim; to destroy 
Giuffre’s reputation and credibility” and that Defendant “made her false statements knowing full 
well that they were completely false. Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and 
deliberate malice, the highest degree of awareness of falsity.” Complaint at p. 8-9. 

Even if there were some kind of technical deficiency in the pleadings, that does not 
justify a stay of discovery. As Judge McKenna noted in Jn re Chase Manhattan Corp. Securities 
Litigation, even if dismissal were to be granted, plaintiffs might thereafter successfully amend 
their complaint, and allowing discovery to go forward could move the action along toward a 
speedier resolution. No. 90 Civ. 6092 LMM, 1991 WL 79432, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 1991) 
(“Should the complaint (or an amended complaint) be sustained .., commencement of the 
discovery process, while no doubt imposing some burden on defendants, will advance the 
ultimate disposition of this action”). Defendant has not established that Ms. Giuffre’s pleading is 
deficient in any way — much less that any deficiency could not be easily corrected through 
amendment. Accordingly, her motion to stay discovery should be denied. 

C. Defendant Has Not Shown “Undue Burden” 

Defendant also falls woefully short of supporting her claim of undue burden in fulfilling 
her discovery obligations. Her failure is understandable given the voluminous number of 
decisions denying stay requests in contexts analogous to this case. See, e.g., Howard v. Galesi, 
107 F.R.D. 348, 351 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (denying a motion to stay discovery pending a motion to 
dismiss because plaintiff's discovery request was not futile, it was limited in scope, and the 


“motion to dismiss was not necessarily dispositive since it concerns the particularity of the 


15 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 21 of 26 


pleadings, which may be amended.”’) (Emphasis added.); Waltzer v. Conner, No. 83 CIV. 8806 
(SWK), 1985 WL 2522, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 1985) (denying a motion to stay discovery 
pending resolution of the motion to dismiss, stating, “‘/b/urdensome and oppressive’ is a 
shibboleth of little value to this Court. Furthermore, good cause is not necessarily established 
solely by showing that discovery may involve inconvenience and expense”) (Emphasis added). 

Two related factors a court may consider in deciding a motion for a stay of discovery are 
the breadth of discovery sought and the burden of responding to it. See Brooks v. Macy's, Inc., 
No. 10 CIV 5304 (BSJ/HBP), 2010 WL 5297756, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2010) (citing Anti— 
Monopoly, Inc., 1996 WL 101277, at *3, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2684, at *6—7). 

Plaintiff served thirty (30) specific and narrowly tailored discovery requests that are 
intended to gather information about the key documents and witnesses in this case. The requests 
are not overly burdensome and relate directly to the Plaintiffs claim that she was a victim of 
sexual abuse, and therefore, Maxwell’s statement that she is a “liar” is defamatory. 

Take Juan Alessi, the housekeeper for Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach home, where 
Defendant also resided. He testified that the Defendant kept a book of nude photos of females on 
her desk. See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 6, Juan Alessi September 8, 2009 Depo Tr. at 
19. Plaintiff recalls being photographed in the nude by the Defendant when she was underage. 
Plaintiff's First Request for Production 18 seeks: “All video tapes, audio tapes, photographs or 
any other print or electronic media relating to Virginia Roberts Giuffre.” See Decl. of Sigrid 
McCawley at Exhibit 9, Plaintiff's First Request for Production 18. Any photos or other media 
that Defendant has in her possession, custody or control that relates to Ms. Giuffre would be 
directly relevant to the sexual abuse underlying the defamatory statement in this case. Ms. 


Giuffre also seeks documents evidencing communications between Ms. Giuffre and the 


16 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 22 of 26 


Defendant. See Decl. of Sigrid McCawley at Exhibit 9, Plaintiff's First Request for Production 
Request No. 2. These documents are highly relevant to establish the involvement of the 
Defendant in Ms. Giuffre’s sexual abuse. Simply put, the discovery seeks all documents related 
specifically to the issues in this case and is, therefore, not overly burdensome. 

Defendant complains about the number of individuals in Plaintiff's Rule 26 disclosures, 
but the overwhelming majority of those witnesses were disclosed in an abundance of caution, in 
order to identify all individuals who “may” have information relating to this case. Only a 
fraction of those individuals will actually be witnesses in this case, and as discovery progresses, 
the list will be further narrowed.* Defendant further complains that the discovery concerns 
events that took place 17 years ago, when Ms. Giuffre was a minor sexual abuse victim. Yet, 
Defendant wholly fails to explain why producing older records should place an undue burden 
upon her beyond a general claim of some “inconvenience and expense.” Waltzer, 1985 WL 
2522, at *1. Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre for sexual abuse in 1999. Any existing records 
from that period are relevant to Ms. Giuffre’s claim, and she is entitled to their discovery. 

Finally, Defendant’s invocation of Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League is inapposite. This 
court granted a stay in discovery in Spinelli due to “the fact that there are currently 40 defendants 
named in the lawsuit, the intricacy of the contractual provisions involved, and the complex 
copyright and antitrust claims asserted” and because a stay “may also have the advantage of 
simplifying and shortening discovery in the event that some of Plaintiffs' claims are dismissed 
and others survive, by limiting the scope of the parties’ inquiry to claims that have been 
established as potentially viable.” Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League, No. 13 CIV. 7398 (RWS), 
2015 WL 7302266, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2015). None of those factors are present in this 
simple defamation case. Instead of multiple claims brought by seven (7) plaintiffs against forty 


* As of the date of this filing, zero (0) disposition notices have been propounded on Defendant. 


17 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 23 of 26 


(40) defendants in Spinelli, there is merely one claim brought by one plaintiff against one 
defendant. Instead of complex issues of antitrust and copyright law in Spinelli, there is one, 
simple defamation claim based upon Defendant’s widely-publicized statements. Furthermore, 
there are no outstanding dispositive motions whose rulings would refine the scope of the claims 
or reduce the number of parties, as in Spinelli. Instead, there is merely a motion to dismiss a 
sole, well-pled count. 

D. There Is Substantial Prejudice To Ms. Giuffre In Staying Discovery 

There is risk of substantial prejudice to Ms. Giuffre in allowing discovery to be stayed. 
Ms. Giuffre has already accommodated Defendant by agreeing to an extension of time that gave 
her close to 70 days from the date of service to file her responsive pleading. On October 27, 
2015, Ms. Giuffre served Defendant with Requests for Production of Documents that are 
narrowly tailored to get to the heart of the issue in this case. By the date of the January 14, 2016 
hearing on this Motion to Stay, Ms. Giuffre’s discovery requests will have been pending for two 
and a half months without a response. The Court has set a tight schedule for the discovery in this 
matter which must be completed in seven months. Defendant’s effort to stay discovery 
indefinitely until the Court rules on the Motion to Dismiss would severely prejudice Ms. Giuffre. 
There are key witnesses in this case who are living abroad and subpoenas will need to be 
coordinated internationally. A stay in discovery may cause testimony of those key witnesses to 
be forfeited if Defendant is allowed to run out the clock by shrinking the discovery period as she 
proposes in the instant motion. 

Moreover, the Court should be aware that the Defendant has, in the past, used delay in 
discovery as a means to defeat any discovery at all. As recounted above, in 2009, the Defendant 


stalled her deposition, only to apparently disappear to an overseas location. 


18 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 20 Filed 12/10/15 Page 24 of 26 


In addition, given that the underlying sexual abuse in this case happened a number of 
years ago, it is imperative that Ms. Giuffre be able to obtain documents and depose witnesses 
quickly to ensure that memories do not fade and documents are not destroyed. “A stay would 
frustrate rather than advance judicial administration. As time progresses, evidence becomes stale, 
memories fade, and the search for truth necessarily becomes more elusive.” Howard v. 
Gutterman, 3 B.R. 393, 394 (S.D.N.Y. 1980). The problems of fading memories, destruction of 
evidence and unavailability of witnesses are augmented in particular in this case, because much 
of the discovery concerns events that took place beginning in 1999. See Dunn v. Albany Med. 
Coll., No. 09-CV-1031 (LEK/DEP), 2010 WL 2326137, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. May 5, 2010) report 
and recommendation adopted in part, No. 1:09-CV-1031 (LEK/DEP), 2010 WL 2326127 
(N.D.N.Y. June 7, 2010) (in a case regarding events that occurred more than 16 years ago, the 
Court determined that “the considerable prejudice to defendant in prolonging discovery any 
further, given the passage of time since alleged events occurred, was sufficient to trump any 
other countervailing factors weighing in favor of a stay”) (citing Geordiadis v. First Boston 
Corp., 167 F.R.D. 24, 25 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“The passage of time always threatens difficulty as 
memories fade. Given the age of this case [six years], that problem probably is severe already. 
The additional delay that plaintiff has caused here can only make matters worse.”’)) (emphasis 
added.) 

CONCLUSION 
Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court deny the stay and 


allow for discovery to proceed as scheduled.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 3 of 14 


Contrary to Plaintiffs assertions, this is not a “simple defamation case.” Rather, under 
the guise of a single claim for defamation, Plaintiff clearly seeks to litigate her false and 
malicious accusations of sexual abuse against Ms. Maxwell. For years, Ms. Maxwell has 
suffered Plaintiff's unabated and unfiltered character attacks in both the media and in thinly- 
veiled press releases masquerading as legal pleadings. Now, Ms. Maxwell has moved to dismiss 
the Complaint with the hopes of ending further dissemination of Plaintiff's decades-old sordid 


allegations characterized by another court as “lurid,” “immaterial and impertinent.” 


Given these circumstances, Ms. Maxwell has amply demonstrated good cause to stay 
discovery pending resolution of her Motion to Dismiss. First, the Motion to Dismiss presents 
multiple, independent bases upon which this Court may dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 
12(b)(6). Each basis for dismissal is legally well-founded and, with respect to the two 
independent privileges, challenges the Complaint on matters of law rather than sufficiency of the 
pleadings. Assuming either privilege applies, any amendment to the Complaint would be futile. 
Second, in her Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Stay (“Opposition” or “Pl’s Opp’n’”) as well 
as in her discovery requests, Plaintiff essentially concedes the breadth of potential discovery. 
Any self-serving characterization of her own discovery requests as “narrowly tailored” is 
disingenuous as even a cursory review can attest. The Opposition alone references dozens of 
potential witnesses, many of whom reside abroad, and purported “mountain[s] of evidence” 


spanning over sixteen years. Third, the length of the stay sought is negligible. Fourth, Plaintiff 





has not demonstrated any unfair prejudice she will suffer as a result of the stay; given the 6 years 
she has already been litigating the same underlying allegations against others, Plaintiff and her 


various attorneys already possess substantially more documents concerning this case than does 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 4 of 14 


Ms. Maxwell who has never been a party previously regarding any of Plaintiff's frivolous 


claims. 


Finally but no less importantly, Ms. Maxwell takes issue with the nature of Plaintiff's 
Opposition. Instead of addressing factors relevant to a stay determination, Plaintiff improperly 
(1) added new allegations not included or referenced in the Complaint; (2) referenced documents 
and evidence not properly considered on a Motion to Dismiss; and (3) effectively extended the 
number of pages allowed in this District in response to a motion to dismiss. Rule 2(D) of this 
Court’s Individual Rules of Practice expressly limits memoranda of law in support of and 
opposition to substantive motions to 25 pages. Because this Opposition actually represents a 
substantive response to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff should not be afforded an additional 25 


pages for essentially a second bite at the Motion to Dismiss apple. 


ARGUMENT 


I. The Motion to Dismiss is Dispositive and Well Founded In Law 


Good cause for a stay does not require a showing that Plaintiff’s claim is definitely 
unmeritorious or that this Court will grant the Motion to Dismiss. Rather, Ms. Maxwell must 
demonstrate that the Motion to Dismiss is “potentially dispositive and appears to be not 
unfounded in the law.” Negrete and Negrete v. Citibank, N.A., 15 CIV. 7250 (RWS), 2015 WL 
8207466, at * 3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2015) (JJ. Sweet). Ms. Maxwell has more than met this 
burden. The Motion to Dismiss challenges the Complaint on multiple grounds, each affording a 


substantial basis for dismissal. 


First, the self-defense privilege is well founded in law and not defeated by Plaintiff's 


conclusory allegations of intent. See Mot. to Dism. at 8-13. Kane v. Orange Cnty. Publ’n, 232 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 5 of 14 


A.D.2d 526, 527 (2d Dept. 1996), illustrates this point. In that case, the appellate court found the 
qualified privilege barred a defamation claim premised upon the defendant’s open letter to a 
newspaper responding to unfavorable publicity against him -- “publicity concededly generated 
with the cooperation of plaintiffs” -- despite that plaintiff’s claims that the letter “contained 
numerous untruths, misrepresentations, and misstatements of fact, known to be false and 
misleading by defendant.” Id. at 526' (emphasis added). This Complaint is similarly premised 
on Ms. Maxwell’s response to Plaintiff's direct attacks in the media against her character. 
Plaintiff ignores the well-settled law that bare allegations of malice are insufficient to defeat the 
self-defense privilege. Compare P|’s Opp’n at 8 (“This allegation alone defeats the application 
of privilege.”) with Mot. to Dism. at 12 (quoting Biro v. Conde Nast, 883 F.Supp.2d 441, 457 
(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“Bare allegations that the defendant knew or should have known that the 


statements were false is insufficient.”).” 


Second, the pre-litigation privilege provides an independent and substantial basis for 
dismissal of the Complaint. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that one of the statements was issued 
in London by Ms. Maxwell’s press agent—a non-lawyer. Pl’s Opp’n at 10. New York courts 
repeatedly apply the pre-litigation privilege to statements made by the “parties, counsel, 
witnesses, and the court.” Int’] Pub. Concepts, LLC v. Locatelli, 9 N.Y.S.3d 593, Slip Op. 50049 
at *3-4 (emphasis added). Of course, if Plaintiff is taking the position that Mr. Gow was not 


speaking for Ms. Maxwell, such would provide an additional reason for dismissal of the 





' As Plaintiff recognizes, the court in Kane ultimately did not reach the question of malice, 
finding no need given the “open letter” was a privileged response to the unfavorable publicity, as is the 
case here, and therefore was not defamatory. Jd. 


* Plaintiff also flagrantly ignores the federal case law providing that qualified privilege is 
properly considered at the motion to dismiss stage. See Mot. to Dism. at 8 (to establish a proper claim for 
defamation, plaintiff must demonstrate that defendant “lack[ed] a privilege’’). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 6 of 14 


Complaint. Otherwise, a communication by a party’s agent typically is treated as a 
communication by the party itself. See In re Copper Market Antitrust Litig., 200 F.R.D. 213 
(S.D.N.Y. 2001) (company’s public relations agent “can fairly be equated” with the company for 
the purpose of analyzing the availability of the attorney-client privilege to protect 
communications). Further, Plaintiff misstates the law when she claims to defeat the privilege 
through her naked assertion that the intent of the statements were “to bully, harass and intimidate 
the Defendant” Pl’s Opp’n at 9. Indeed, the Khalil court specifically declined to adopt any such 
element equivalent to spite or malice, instead applying the pre-litigation privilege to any 
statement made pertinent to “pending or contemplated litigation.” Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 24 
N.Y.3d 713, 720 (2015); see also Int’l Pub. Concepts, Slip Op. 50049 at *3-4. Ms. Maxwell 
respectfully refers the Court to the Motion to Dismiss in which she details that her January 3 
Statement specifically “reserve[d] her right to seek redress at the repetition of such claims.” 


Mot. to Dism. at 15. 


Third, the Motion to Dismiss raises three potentially fatal pleading deficiencies in the 
Complaint. For each pleading deficiency, Ms. Maxwell cites to binding and persuasive authority 
(including several cases decided by this Court) that require dismissal of defamation claims which 
fail to adequately plead the “to whom, where or in what manner” any such statements were 
made, as well as the need for special damages. See Mot. to Dism. at 17-23; e.g., Cruz v. 
Marchetto, No. 11 Civ. 8378, 2012 WL 4513484, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (dismissing defamation 


claim for failure to meet the pleading standards set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 8). 


II. Discovery in This Case Will Be Extremely Costly and Burdensome 


Not a single aspect of Plaintiffs discovery requests have been “narrowly tailored” to the 


heart of this action: the circumstances surrounding any allegedly defamatory statements. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 7 of 14 


Instead, as is apparent from the new and increasingly outlandish allegations raised in opposition, 
Plaintiff clearly intends a “kitchen sink” approach to discovery. In a case such as this that 
encompasses allegations dating back over sixteen (16) years and involves hundreds of 
individuals living in various countries, the costs and burden of discovery will be extremely high. 
When facing such “mountains” of discovery, courts routinely grant a motion to stay pending the 
outcome of a dispositive motion.* Johnson v. N.Y.U. Sch. Of Educ. 205 F.R.D. 433 (S.D.N.Y. 
2002) (granting stay of discovery to obviate burdensome discovery including extensive 
interrogatories that “ask[] for information covering a span of more than five years”); Am. 
Booksellers Assoc. v. Houghton Mifflin Co., Inc., 94 CIV. 8566 (JFK), 1995 WL 72376 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 1995) (“The discovery sought by plaintiffs is very broad and to require 


defendants to respond to it at this juncture...would be extremely burdensome.”’). 


Emblematic of Plaintiff's mischaracterization of the breadth of discovery in this case is 
her claim that she served thirty (30) discovery requests when in fact she served thirty nine (39). 
Mot. for Stay, Ex. A. In the Motion to Stay, Ms. Maxwell referenced four glaring examples of 
Plaintiffs so-called “narrowly tailored” discovery requests. The rest are no more “narrowly 


tailored”; other examples include: 


e All documents identifying passengers, manifests, or flight plans for any helicopter 
or plane ever owned or controlled by your or Jeffrey Epstein or any associated 
entity from 1999 — present. (No. 9) 


e All documents relating to payments made from Jeffrey Epstein or any related 
entity to you from 1999-present, including payments for work performed, gifts, 


: Interestingly, Plaintiff claims there exists a “voluminous number of decisions denying stay 
requests in contexts analogous to this case” yet cites two cases—both from 1985— that are anything but 
analogous to this case. See Howard v. Galesi, 107 F.R.D. 348, 350 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (noting that 
discovery requests were not served on the moving party, the moving party did not argue that document 
requests were burdensome or overreaching, and the party to which the discovery requests were served did 
not object); Waltzer v. Conner, No. 83 CIV 8806 (SWK), 1985 WL 2522, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 1985) 
(denying motion to stay where moving party made only conclusory statements to establish good cause). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 8 of 14 


real estate purchases, living expenses, and payments to your charitable endeavors 
including the TerraMar project. (No. 10) 


e All documents reflecting communications you have had with Bill or Hillary 
Clinton (or persons acting on their behalf), including all communications 
regarding your attendance at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding ceremony in 2010. (No. 
37) 


e All documents reflecting training to fly a helicopter or experience flying a 
helicopter, including any records concerning your operation of a helicopter in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. (No. 39). 


Mot. for Stay, Ex. A. 


Plaintiff claims that this Court’s decision in Spinelli is inapposite. Pl’s Opp’n. at 17. Ina 
sense, she is correct: the potential discovery in Spinelli pales in comparison to the anticipated 
discovery here. Spinelli v. Nat’! Football League, No. 13 CIV. 7398 (RWS), 2015 WL 7302266, 
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2015). This case involves 94 potential witnesses, many of whom live 
abroad, and decades-old factual allegations that purportedly involve the Clintons, members of the 
British Royal Family, an esteemed Harvard Law Professor, flight manifests, helicopter lessons, 


Victoria Secret models, and so on. This is not a “simple defamation claim.” 


Til. Plaintiff Cannot Establish Substantial Prejudice 


Plaintiff presents a two-pronged complaint of prejudice: one, Plaintiff claims that a stay 
of discovery “indefinitely” will “run out the clock” on Plaintiff's discovery requests (Pl’s Opp’n 
at 18); and two, memories of potential witnesses are bound to fade and evidence may grow stale 
during the pendency of the Motion to Dismiss. (/d. at 19). Both positions are frivolous, not 


supported by specific evidence, and incorrect. 


To be clear, Ms. Maxwell seeks a stay of discovery for only the definite period of time it 
takes this Court to decide the Motion to Dismiss. Briefing will be complete by December 28, 


2015, and oral argument is scheduled for January 14, 2016. Doc. #19. Nothing suggests this 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 9 of 14 


Court will decide the Motion in anything other than an expeditious manner. Thus, any stay 


would last at most for a brief period. 


Next, Plaintiff has been represented by counsel and publicly raised allegations against 
Ms. Maxwell since at least May 4, 2009 (Compl. { 4). Ms. Maxwell consistently has denied 
Plaintiff's allegations, both publicly and privately. Plaintiff cannot therefore complain of “fading 
memories” and “stale evidence” during a months’ long stay when she waited years to bring a 
claim against Ms. Maxwell regarding events she claimed occurred 16 years ago (including four 
years since she claims Ms. Maxwell first issued a statement about her). In addition, Plaintiff has 
not provided a single example of a memory at risk of fading or evidence that may become stale 
during a potential stay. Absent specifics, Plaintiff cannot establish a substantial prejudice. See 
Bethpage Water Dist. v. Northrop Grumman Corp., No. 13-CV-6362 SJF WDW, 2014 WL 
6883529, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2014); see also Gandler v. Nazarov, No. 94 Civ. 2272 (CSH), 
1994 WL 702004, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 1994) (granting stay of discovery because, inter alia, 
plaintiffs presented no evidence suggesting unfair prejudice caused by a stay.); cf. In re 
LaBranche Sec. Litig., 333 F.Supp.2d 178, (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (J. Sweet) (finding plaintiffs would 
be unduly prejudiced by a continued stay which would result in plaintiffs being the only 
interested party without access to relevant documents rendering them unable to make informed 


decisions about litigation strategy). 


The court’s analysis in Bethpage Water is directly applicable here: 


The risks of which plaintiff complain do not unfairly prejudice 
plaintiff, but rather are usual litigation risks that affect all the 
parties equally, regardless of the amount of time permitted for 
discovery... Thus, any marginal impact on the evidence and/or 
memories of witnesses does not outweigh the substantial burden 
and expense of conducting time-consuming fact and expert 
discovery on all issues in this case pending a decision on a 
potentially dispositive motion. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 10 of 14 


Id. (citing ITT Corp. v. Travelers Cas. & Surety Co., NO. 12-civ-38, 2012 WL 2944357, at *3-4 
(D. Conn. July 18, 2012)). 

Plaintiff already possesses numerous documents that she asserts are supportive of her 
claims. See Pl’s Opp’n at | (“[o]verwhelming evidence” which is “publicly available” 
purportedly “corroborates” Plaintiffs claims); Decl. of Sigrid McCawley & Exs. 1-9 (including 
police reports and deposition transcripts which likely are not publicly available). With the 
assistance of able counsel, Plaintiff has litigated similar allegations based on the same facts 
against Mr. Jeffrey Epstein from 2009 — 2011. Compl. {| 17. She has involved herself in 
discussions with the FBI. /d. 22. And she has attempted to participate in the federal civil 
action against the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida based on the Crime 
Victim’s Rights Act. Jd. { 26-27. Plaintiff’s former counsel currently is actively participating in 
defamation litigation against Professor Dershowitz in Florida state court, and Plaintiff through 
her current counsel has participated repeatedly as a non-party in that action. See Bradley 
Edwards and Paul Cassell v. Alan Dershowitz, Case No. 15-000072, Broward County, Fla.* By 
virtue of the deposition transcripts, police reports and other litigation papers Plaintiff already has 
gathered, attached to her Opposition and claims are pertinent to her false allegations of abuse, 
she has in effect demonstrated the absence of prejudice to her of any stay. See Chrysler Capital 
Corp. v. Century Power Corp., 137 F.R.D. 209 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (granting motion to stay where 
discovery request are extensive and plaintiffs already possessed extensive discovery material as a 


result of prior proceedings).

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 11 of 14 


In sum, all of the factors weigh in favor of a stay of discovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
26(c). Ms. Maxwell’s Motion to Dismiss contains multiple, substantial grounds for dismissal, 
the breadth of discovery is poised to be nearly limitless, and Plaintiff cannot show any undue 


prejudice resulting from a short stay. Ms. Maxwell’s motion should therefore be granted. 


IV. Plaintiff’s “Background” Section Should Be Disregarded 


Plaintiffs “Background” section and supporting Declaration of Sigrid McCawley raise 
factual allegations and reference documents that may not properly be considered on a Motion to 
Dismiss.’ They therefore should not be considered in connection with this Motion to Stay 


premised on, at least indirectly, the merits of the Motion to Dismiss. 


In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), “a 
district court must limit itself to facts stated in the complaint or in documents attached to the 
complaint as exhibits or incorporated in the complaint by reference. Of course, it may also 
consider matters of which judicial notice may be taken under Fed. R. Evid. 201.” Kramer v. 
Time Warner Cable Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 773 (2d Cir. 1991). Before considering documents 
outside of the complaint, several conditions must be met. Specifically, “even if a document is 
‘integral’ to the complaint, it must be clear on the record that no dispute exists regarding the 
authenticity or accuracy of the document...It must also be clear that there exists no material 
disputed issues of fact regarding the relevance of the document.” Faulkner v. Beer, 463 F.3d 
130, 134 (2d Cir. 2006). Finally, if the court elects to consider documents entirely outside the 


complaint, it must convert the motion to one for summary judgment and give the parties an 





> Here, “Background” is a euphemism for “extrajudicial statements” that Plaintiff and her lawyers 
are prohibited from making under New York Rules of Professional Conduct 3.6 and 8.4(d). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 22 Filed 12/15/15 Page 12 of 14 


opportunity to conduct appropriate discovery and submit additional supporting material 


contemplated by Rule 56. Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 154 (2d Cir. 2002). 


Plaintiff here attempts to use the “Background” section of her Opposition to slip 
additional false accusations against Ms. Maxwell through the proverbial back door. Her 
references to deposition transcripts in the 2009 litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was not a party, 
and thus had no opportunity to defend herself, are particularly egregious. See Pl’s Opp’n at 3-5. 
As Ms. Maxwell detailed in her Motion to Dismiss, this by no means represents the first time 
Plaintiff has introduced salacious and false accusations in a court pleading. On April 7, 2015 
U.S. District Court Judge Marra denied Plaintiff’s Rule 21 motion to join a 2008 CVRA 
litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, ordered the portions of 
the Joinder Motion pertaining to non-parties including Ms. Maxwell stricken as “immaterial and 
impertinent,” and restricted the documents mentioning “lurid details” from public access. Mot. 


to Dism. at 4-5. 


Plaintiff's undoubtedly included the superfluous false allegations, both in the Florida 
actions and here in order to draw additional media attention as a means to further her malicious 
character attack against Ms. Maxwell. The quotations from the deposition transcripts and 
“sworn statements” to the Palm Beach Police Department are not relevant to the Motion to Stay 
and may not be considered on a Motion to Dismiss. The entire “Background” section should 


therefore be disregarded as impertinent, immaterial and scandalous.° 





° Ms. Maxwell also notes that this Court may follow Judge Marra’s lead and issue a sua sponte 
order striking the allegations in the “background” section pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 12(f).

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 6 of 32 


Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files this 


Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, and in support thereof, states as follows: 


INTRODUCTION 

This is an old and familiar story. A Defendant, who committed repeated acts of sexual 
abuse, publicly proclaims the victim is lying to try to deflect attention from the crimes and to bully 
the victim back into silence. But this story will not end here. Defamation law protects victims 
when they are courageous enough to stand up against their abuser’s false character assaults. Based 
on her well-pled Complaint, Ms. Giuffre has stated a defamation claim, and, therefore, is entitled 
to move forward with discovery to prove that Defendant’s statements were not only false, but 
entirely fabricated out of malice. 

The allegations Ms. Giuffre has made in her Complaint present a straightforward claim of 
defamation. As she alleges in her Complaint, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and 
Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, sexually abused Ms. Giuffre. Indeed, the Defendant herself 
recruited and groomed Ms. Giuffre to be sexually abused when Ms. Giuffre was only fifteen (15) 
years old. Over the next several years, Epstein and Defendant trafficked Ms. Giuffre to their 
friends worldwide. Ultimately, Ms. Giuffre escaped. 

Several years later, having gained a sense of safety and perspective, Ms. Giuffre sought to 
join a long-running Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”) lawsuit, which was brought by other 
young girls who were also abused, and sought to challenge Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution 
agreement which also pardoned co-conspirators. Through lawyers’, Ms. Giuffre explained what 


Epstein and Defendant had done to her, prompting a broadside of attacks earlier this year from the 


* Ms. Giuffre is represented in the CVRA case by a former Federal Judge for the District of Utah, Paul Cassell, and a 
victim’s rights lawyer, Bradley Edwards. (Case No. 08-cv-80736-KAM, Southern District of Florida.) 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 7 of 32 


Defendant.” 

After sexually trafficking Ms. Giuffre for years, Defendant now has the audacity to 
broadcast that Ms. Giuffre is a “liar” and that her life story is concocted. And Defendant even 
claims that she is somehow “privileged” to launch these assaults. 

Of course, the Court need not decide today who is lying and who is telling the truth. The 
narrow issue before the Court now is only whether Ms. Giuffre has pled an actionable defamation 
case. Ms. Giuffre’s Complaint sets forth specific well-pled allegations that present the elements of 
a defamation claim, including precisely-described defamatory statements that the Defendant made 
with actual malice: 


e Ms. Giuffre “became a victim of sexual trafficking and repeated sexual abuse after being 
recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when Giuffre was under the age of 
eighteen...Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell, 
Epstein sexually abused Giuffre at numerous locations including his mansions in West 
Palm Beach Florida and in this District.” See Declaration of Sigrid McCawley 
(“McCawley Decl.’’), Ex. 1, Compl. at | 8, 9 and 16. 


e “As part of their sex trafficking efforts, Epstein and Maxwell intimidated Giuffre into 
remaining silent about what happened to her.” /d. at 410. 


e “With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to sexually abuse Giuffre for years until 
Giuffre eventually escaped.” Jd. at 418. 


e “Ultimately as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believes that she 
should speak out about her sexual abuse experience in the hopes of helping 


* Defendant spends a significant amount of time in her Motion to Dismiss discussing Judge Marra’s ruling in the 
CVRA case that dealt with Alan Dershowitz’s Motion to Strike. Defendant flatly mischaracterizes the Order, which, 
in any event, is irrelevant to this Motion to Dismiss. In the CVRA case, Ms. Giuffre filed a joinder motion to attempt 
to join the other victims who were prosecuting the case. The Court found that joinder of another victim was 
unnecessary because the two named plaintiffs were sufficient to represent the group of victims in their claim that the 
government failed to properly notify them of the plea agreement with Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Marra held that “at this 
juncture in the proceedings” the details about the sexual abuse that Ms. Giuffre had suffered was unnecessary to the 
Court making a determination “of whether Jane Doe 3 [Ms. Giuffre] and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted to join [the 
other victims’ ] claim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding with 
whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are impertinent to this central claim (1.e. that they were 
known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties) especially considering that the details 
involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government.” No. 08-cv-80736-KAM, D.E. 324 at 5 
(emphasis original). The Judge explained that Ms. Giuffre would be entitled to participate as a witness in the case to 
offer her evidence as needed. (D.E. 324 at 8.) 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 8 of 32 


others...Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims Refuse Silence...Giuffre has 
now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex trafficking.” Jd. at § 23-25. 


e “In January 2015, Maxwell undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to discredit 
Giuffre and damage her reputation that Giuffre’s factual reporting of what happened to her 
would not be credited.” Jd. at ¥ 28. 


e “As part of Maxwell’s campaign she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to attack Giuffre’s 
honesty and truthfulness and accuse Giuffre of lying.” Jd. at | 29. 


e Defendant stated through her press agent that Ms. Giuffre’s reports of her child sexual 
abuse were “obvious lies.” /d. at J 30. 


e Defendant published the defamatory statements to third parties including: “‘issu[ing] an 
additional false statement to the media and public,” and to “a reporter on a Manhattan 
street.” Id. at § 30, 4 3. 


e “Maxwell made the...defamatory statements...in the Southern District of New York...in a 
deliberate effort to maliciously discredit Giuffre and silence her efforts to expose sex 
crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons...” 
Id. at {| 32. 


e ‘“Maxwell’s statements were published intentionally for the malicious purpose of further 
damaging a sexual abuse and sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and 
credibility” and that Defendant “made her false statements knowing full well that they 
were completely false. Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate 
malice, the highest degree of awareness of falsity.” Jd. at {J 8-9. 


e Defendant’s defamatory statements “tended to injure Giuffre in her professional capacity 
as the president of a non-profit corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking, 
inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation among members of the 
community that seek her help and that she seeks to serve.”* Id. at § 11. 


In response to the straight-forward Complaint, Defendant first argues that she was 


privileged to launch these attacks on Ms. Giuffre because of either a self-defense privilege or a 


> Defendant’s effort to include information outside the four corners of the complaint should be rejected. See Ge 
Dandong v. Pinnacle Performance Ltd., 966 F. Supp. 2d 374 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“It is well-established that when 
deciding a motion to dismiss... a court's ‘review is limited to the facts as asserted within the four corners of the 
complaint, the documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and any documents incorporated in the complaint by 
reference.””) (quoting McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2007)). Notably, Defendant 
switches gears in her Reply in Support of her Motion to Stay and agrees that the Court “must limit itself to facts stated 
in the complaint.” (Maxwell’s Reply in Support of Stay Motion at 9). Accordingly, the 2011 article at Ex. A of Laura 
Menninger’s Declaration in Support of her Motion to Dismiss should not be considered because it does not contain the 
actionable statement set forth in the Complaint. (See Declaration of Laura Menninger at Ex. A). By her own words, it 
must be disregarded. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 9 of 32 


pre-litigation privilege. As part of a motion to dismiss, these arguments must be rejected. First, 
qualified privileges are forfeited when the defamatory statement is made with malice and is false. 
Because Ms. Giuffre has specifically alleged that Defendant defamed her with actual malice, the 
privileges provide no defense. Second, the Court should not consider Defendant’s qualified 
privilege argument at the Motion to Dismiss stage because it is premature. See Block v. First 
Blood Associates, 691 F. Supp. 685, 699-700 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (In a case in which 
another defendant claimed a pre-litigation privilege based upon statements to the press, this Court 
held, “[t]o prevail on a qualified privilege defense [defendant] must show that his claim of 
privilege does not raise triable issues of fact that would defeat it. Here, sufficient evidence has 
been adduced to support the inference that [defendant] acted with malice, and may not, therefore, 
claim a qualified privilege under New York law . . . a genuine issue as to malice and appropriate 
purpose has properly been raised and is sufficient to preclude summary judgment.”). Defendant’s 
asserted qualified privileges are merely affirmative defenses to be raised in her answer. 

Third, Defendant discusses a 2011 statement, which is not the statement at issue, in an 
effort to confuse the Court into accepting her “pre-litigation privilege” argument. The actionable 
statement was Defendant’s 2015 press release to the media charging Ms. Giuffre with lying about 
being sexually abused. New York’s highest court found, in this exact situation, that where a sexual 
abuse victim is called a “liar,” she has an actionable claim for defamation and it is more than a 
“mere denial.” In Davis v. Boeheim, 245 N.Y .3d 262, 268, 22 N.E.3d 999 (2014), the court found 
that stating that a person is lying about their sexual abuse is “susceptible of a defamatory 
connotation” because the statement “tends to expose [Plaintiff] to public contempt, hatred, 
ridicule, aversion or disgrace.” See also McNamee v. Clemens, 762 F. Supp. 2d 584, 602 
(E.D.N.Y. 2011) (court explaining “[t]he statements that brand McNamee a liar and suggest that 


there are unknown facts that when disclosed will support Clemens' denials and that suggest that 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 10 of 32 


the statements meet the definition of defamation go beyond a general denial of accusations or 
rhetorical name calling. The statements were direct and often forcefully made, there was nothing 
loose or vague about them.”’). Finally, Ms. Giuffre has pled all necessary elements of a defamation 
claim in detail with supporting facts. For those reasons, as explained in full below, Defendant’s 
Motion to Dismiss should be denied. 

ARGUMENT 

In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court must take all allegations in the Complaint as 
true and all inferences are drawn in favor of the pleader. Worldhomecenter.com, Inc. v. M.J. 
Resurrection, Inc., (Sweet, J.) No. 11 CIV. 3371 (RWS), 2012 WL 12922, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 
2012). “The issue ‘is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is 
entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.’” /d. Ms. Giuffre has stated a colorable claim with 
specificity, therefore, she is entitled to move forward and prove her claim. 

I. Maxwell’s Statements Are Not Protected By A Qualified Privilege. 

Defendant’s qualified privilege argument fails for three independent reasons, each 
requiring this Court to deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss. First, a privilege is an affirmative 
defense, which must be pled in an answer to a complaint and then properly proved. A motion to 
dismiss is not a proper vehicle for presenting such an argument. Second, the qualified privileges 
raised by Defendant (self-defense and pre-litigation) are forfeited if they are abused. Because Ms. 
Giuffre has alleged that Defendant launched her assault with actual malice and for an improper 
purpose, the privileges provide no defense. Third, the circumstances alleged by Defendant do not 
fit the privileges she is alleging: under New York law, no qualified privilege, - neither “self- 
defense” nor “‘pre-litigation” - applies to Defendant’s statements. 

As this Court has explained, “[u]nder New York law, a qualified or conditional privilege 


may exist where statements are made, without malice, in furtherance of a common interest. There 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 11 of 32 


is no qualified privilege under New York law when such statements are spoken with malice, 
knowledge of their falsity, or reckless disregard for their truth.” Block at 699 (Sweet, J.) (Internal 
citations omitted). 

A defendant forfeits an alleged qualified privilege “by making a false, defamatory 
statement with ‘malice’ of either the common-law or constitutional variety.” Albert v. Loksen, 239 
F.3d 256, 272 (2d Cir. 2001). See also Park Knoll Associates v. Schmidt, 59 N.Y .2d 205, 211, 451 
N.E.2d 182, 185 (1983) (“The complaint here contains sufficient allegations of malice to 
withstand the motion to dismiss.”’). 

Even if a qualified privilege otherwise applies, it “is nevertheless forfeited if the defendant 
steps outside the scope of the privilege and abuses the occasion.” Weldy v. Piedmont Airlines, Inc., 
985 F.2d 57, 62 (2d Cir. 1993) (internal quotations omitted). In Weldy, the Second Circuit 
explained that a Plaintiff may defeat an assertion of a qualified privilege by demonstrating abuse 
of the privilege “by proving that the defendant acted (1) with common law malice, or (2) outside 
the scope of the privilege, or (3) with knowledge that the statement was false or with a reckless 
disregard as to its truth.” Jd. at 62. In this case, the Defendant has fulfilled all three of the above 
conditions. 

Here, Ms. Giuffre has pled facts to support her claim that Defendant’s defamatory 
statements are false, and were published with the “malicious intent of discrediting and further 
damaging [Ms. Giuffre] worldwide.” See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at § 1. Defendant can 
cite to no authority that supports her position that publicly stating that a victim of sexual abuse is 
lying about being sexually abused as a minor child falls within any qualified privilege, and her 


assertion of that proposition is a complete misreading of the law. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 12 of 32 


It Is Premature For The Court To Determine Qualified Privilege. 

As an initial matter, under both federal and New York law, determining whether a 
qualified privilege applies is premature and should not be decided at the Motion to Dismiss stage 
because Ms. Giuffre is entitled to establish that Defendant knew the defamatory statement was 
false and made for an improper purpose, thereby extinguishing any claim for a qualified privilege. 
In another defamation case brought before this Court, in which the defendant also made 
defamatory statements to the press and then tried to claim the pre-litigation privilege, this Court 
held that where a genuine issue as to the malice and appropriate purpose has properly been raised, 
a determination on the application of the privilege was precluded, even at the summary judgment 
stage. See Block, 691 F. Supp. at 699-700 (Sweet, J.); see also Roberti v. Schroder Inv. Mgmt. N. 
Am., Inc., No. 04CIV2404 (LTS) (THK), 2006 WL 647718, at *9 (Swain, J.) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 
2006) (Judge Swain found the same, denying the motion to dismiss on a defamation claim because 
“a claim of qualified privilege may be rebutted by a showing that the statement, or the implication 
thereof, was made with spite or ill will or with a high degree of awareness of [its] probable falsity” 
and plaintiff's complaint “could support a finding that the statement was made with the requisite 
high degree of awareness that it was probably false.”) (internal quotations omitted);* Weldy, 985 
F.2d at 63 (the Second Circuit found that whether the privilege had been abused and, therefore, 
lost was a question for the jury to decide.). 

New York state courts, examining alleged qualified privileges in defamation cases, have 


held the same. For example, in Whelehan v. Yazback, 84 A.D.2d 673, 673, 446 N.Y.S.2d 626, 627 


* Defendant misleadingly cites Biro v. Conde Nast for the proposition that the affirmative defense of privileges may be 
resolved on a motion to dismiss, but Biro dismissed claims based on absolute privileges, whose application required 
no factual determinations, but could be determined on the face of the pleadings, in contrast to the qualified privileges 
Defendant asserts here, which require a determination of malice and improper purpose. 883 F. Supp. 2d 441, 458 
(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (dismissing some claims due to their being nonactionable opinion and protected by New York Civil 
Rights Law § 74 (fair report privilege) because the court need only “consider the allegations and the statements in the 
court records in order to determine whether the Article provides a ‘fair and true’ report of those allegations and 
statements, but will not consider the documents to be evidence of any of the facts stated therein.”’). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 13 of 32 


(1981), the court denied the motion for summary judgment based on the affirmative defense of 
qualified privilege: “defendant's motion for summary judgment based on qualified privilege and 
plaintiff's motion to strike this defense were properly denied since qualified privilege is a defense 
to be pleaded and proved... and questions of fact exist as to its applicability here.” Further, as the 
Bellan court explained, when reversing an order dismissing a defamation claim, “the defendant 
cannot prevail upon this motion on the ground of a qualified privilege. Qualified privilege is an 
affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved by the defendant.” Teichner v. Bellan, 7 A.D.2d 247, 
252, 181 N.Y.S.2d 842 (1959). See also Colantonio v. Mercy Med. Ctr., 115 A.D.3d 902, 903, 
982 N.Y.S.2d 563, 566 (2014) (“...this privilege...can be overcome by a showing of malice ... At 
this juncture [motion to dismiss], the allegations of malice that were set forth in the complaint ... 
preclude dismissal of the complaint...”); Kamchi v. Weissman, 125 A.D.3d 142, 159, 1 N.Y.S.3d 
169, 182 (N.Y. App. Div. 2014) (the complaint “sufficiently alleged that [Defendant] made false 
statements of fact with common-law malice so as to overcome the common interest qualified 
privilege”); Long v. Marubeni Am. Corp., 406 F. Supp. 2d 285, 298 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (denying a 
motion to dismiss based, inter alia, upon an qualified privilege argument because the complaint 
alleged the defamatory statements were made “with knowledge of their falsity,” and supported that 
claim “with at least some facts,” and, therefore, “[n]othing more is required at this stage of 
litigation [to maintain the claim]”).° Accordingly, Defendant’s qualified privilege arguments are 


not ripe for judicial determination upon a Motion to Dismiss. 


‘ Notably, the case law cited by Defendant also holds that qualified privilege is an issue for the jury to decide. See 
Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss (“MTD”) at 8, Shenkman v. O'Malley, 2 A.D.2d 567, 576, 
157 N.Y.S.2d 290, 299 (1956) (whether defendant’s statement fell under the self-defense qualified privilege “cannot 
be said on the pleading alone,” but instead is “a proper question for the jury to determine”); MTD at 8, Fowler v. New 
York Herald Co., 184 A.D. 608, 611, 172 N.Y.S. 423, 425 (App. Div. 1918), (“Whether the defendant in its

B. The Qualified Self-Defense Privilege Does Not Exonerate Defendant From Her 
Malicious Defamatory Statements 


Defendant contends that her statements are subject to a qualified privilege because they 
were made in “self-defense.” Defendant’s statements went beyond simply denying the allegations; 
instead, she attacked the moral character of this sexual abuse victim by publicly proclaiming her 
claims of sexual abuse were “obvious lies” and suggesting that Defendant knew facts that were 
unknown to the public. Defamatory statements of that type, as explained further below, are not 
protected by a “self-defense” privilege, particularly when, as here, they are knowingly false. 


1. The Statements Were Made With Malice And With Knowledge Of Their Falsity, 
Thus Defeating Any Privilege. 





Defendant’s attempts to fit her defamatory statements against a victim of sexual abuse 
within the parameters of a qualified privilege must be rejected because Defendant made the 
statements with malice, knowing that they were false. Plaintiff will be able to show, without 
question, that Defendant knows that Plaintiff is not lying when she describes how Defendant 
recruited her for sex as an underage girl and when she describes the other trafficking activities 
Defendant engaged in. Once a defendant has proven the affirmative defense of qualified privilege, 
which Defendant has not yet done, that privilege is nonetheless defeated if “plaintiff can establish 
that the communication was actuated by malice.” See Block, 691 F. Supp. at 699 (Sweet, J.); 
Whelehan, 446 N.Y.S.2d at 674 (“defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a 
cause of action should have been denied. Plaintiff's pleading of ‘malice aforethought’ is sufficient 
to avoid dismissal in view of the fact that qualified privilege is an affirmative defense to be 


pleaded and proved by defendant and that, when malice is required to be pleaded, conclusory 


Co., 150 A.D. 169, 179, 134 N.Y.S. 847 (App. Div. 1912) (evidence bearing on questions of privilege “were plainly 
questions for the jury’’). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 15 of 32 


allegations of malice have been held sufficient.”).° As pled in the Complaint, Defendant knew the 
statements were false because Defendant engaged in and facilitated the sexual abuse of this minor 


child. 


2. Calling A Sexual Abuse Victim A “Liar” Is More Than A “General Denial” And 
Qualifies As Defamation. 





Though Defendant claims that she was merely issuing a “general denial,” she went well 
beyond that and accused Ms. Giuffre of making claims that were “obvious lies,” with the clear 
implication that Defendant had knowledge unknown to the audience that would support her 
statement. Under New York law, such a statement constitutes grounds for a defamation claim. See 
Davis, 245 N.Y.3d at 268 (New York’s highest court holding that stating someone is lying about 
sexual abuse is “susceptible of a defamatory connotation.”’); see also McNamee v. Clemens, 762 F. 
Supp. 2d 584 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (“[a]n attack on a person's integrity by impugning his character as 
dishonest or immoral may form the basis of a defamation if an ordinary listener would tend to 
credit the statements as true.”); Kaminester v. Weintraub, 131 A.D.2d 440, 516 N.Y.S.2d 234 (2d 
Dep't 1987) (statements accusing plaintiff of personal dishonesty were not constitutionally 
protected expressions of opinion); Edwards v. Nat’l Audubon Soc., Inc., 556 F.2d 113, 121-22 (2d 
Cir. 1977) (“The appellees were charged with being ‘paid to lie’. It is difficult to conceive of any 
epithet better calculated to subject a scholar to the scorn and ridicule of his colleagues than ‘paid 
liar.’ It is this completely foundationless accusation of venality that constitutes the essence of the 
calumny against the appellees.”); Brach v. Congregation Yetev Lev D'Satmar, Inc., 265 A.D.2d 


360, 361, 696 N.Y.S.2d 496, 498 (2d Dep't 1999) (reversing an order of dismissal and reinstating 


° Defendant cites Biro v. Conde Nast, 2014 WL 4851901 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2014) for the proposition that Ms. 
Giuffre has not sufficiently pled malice. However, in Biro, the only accusation of malice was that the defendant 
““knew or should have known’ that the statements were false,” and “the Complaint contains no factual allegations 
indicating that [defendant] acted recklessly in making that assumption — or had any reason to entertain doubts about 
the truth.” /d., 2014 WL 4851901, at *2. The facts here could not be more different: not only has Ms. Giuffre alleged 
that Defendant knows the allegations are false because she was an active participant in the sexual abuse, but she 
detailed Defendant’s involvement with the corroborating evidence of her involvement. 


10 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 16 of 32 


defamation action based upon a publication stating that a court action was won “by lies and 
deceit,” finding that the statements at issue were actionable statements of “mixed opinion,” and 
noting that they suggested to the average reader that they were supported by some unknown facts); 
Mase v. Reilly, 206 A.D. 434, 436, 201 N.Y.S. 470, 472 (App. Div. 1923) (reversing dismissal of 
the complaint and holding: “The charge that a man is lying, at least, in a matter of public interest, 
is such a charge as tends to hold him up to scorn, as matter of law, and prima facie a complaint 
stating the making in writing of such a charge is good.”). 

Here, Defendant has attacked Ms. Giuffre’s integrity, calling her dishonest and stating that 
her claims of abuse were “obvious lies,” implying that Defendant knows certain facts unknown to 
her audience that support her opinion. An ordinary listener would tend to credit the statements as 
true because Defendant traveled with, and lived with, Ms. Giuffre while she was a child abuse 
victim. As the Clemens court explained: “Clemens’ statements that McNamee is a liar are facts 
capable of being proven true or false by a determination of whether or not McNamee injected 
Clemens with steroids. The statements can be proven true or false by either truthful testimony or 
conclusive evidence.” /d. at 601. Similarly, Defendant’s statement that Ms. Giuffre is lying is a 
fact capable of being proven true or false by a determination of whether Ms. Giuffre was sexually 


abused by Defendant. 


3. Defendant’s Cited Cases Do Not Support Her Assertion Of The Self-Defense 
Privilege. 


Interestingly, the only case Defendant cites wherein a court holds that calling someone a 
liar isn’t defamatory, Independent Living Aids, Inc. v. Maxi-Aids, Inc., 981 F. Supp. 124, 128 


(E.D.N.Y. 1997), is a case that sounded in slander (spoken defamation), whereas this is a libel 


11 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 17 of 32 


case (written defamation).’ What constitutes defamation for libel under New York law is a much 
broader category, while defamation under slander is restricted to four specific categories of 
statements, as discussed infra. Ms. Giuffre has sufficiently pled Jibel, and many New York courts 
have held that calling someone a liar constitutes libel. Buried in a string cite, and presented 
without explanation or argument, Defendant cites Shenkman v. O'Malley, 2 A.D.2d 567, 157 
N.Y.S.2d 290, (1956), in which the Court reversed the lower court’s striking of the affirmative 
defense of the self-defense qualified privilege. MTD at 8. Notably, Shenkman not only held that 
the self-defense qualified privilege was a question for the jury to decide, but it also held that this 
affirmative defense only applies when the defendant’s statement is in response to another 
defamatory statement: the “defamatory reply to attack, if it is to be privileged, must, among other 
things, be a reply to a defamatory attack.” /d. at 576. Therefore, under Shenkman, in order to meet 
her burden, Defendant would have to prove - after the motion to dismiss stage - that Ms. Giuffre’s 
accusations are defamatory - something she has not done, and never can, because the allegations 
of sexual abuse are true. 

Defendant’s other cases are also readily distinguished. For example, she cites Kane v. 
Orange Cty. Publications, 232 A.D.2d 526, 649 N.Y.S.2d 23 (1996) in support of her self-defense 
privilege, but this was an action brought pursuant to Civil Rights Law § 51, which authorizes a 
civil action when the name or likeness of any living person is used for advertising without written 
consent. Moreover, since it wasn’t a defamation claim, the court never made a ruling as to whether 
to apply any privilege, but merely noted that the complaint allegations “correspond to elements of 


a cause of action sounding in libel” and, then, “further note[d]” that it would be “covered by a 


7 At least one New York court has found that calling someone a liar is defamation even under the slander standard. 
See Seung Jin Lee v. Tai Chul Kim, 16 Misc. 3d 1118(A), 847 N.Y.S.2d 899 (Sup. Ct. 2007) (denying a motion to 
dismiss when the defendant stated that the plaintiff “is a liar; she tried to cover all the truth; how could she serve the 
Lord with lies; and she and her followers are satanic.”). 


12 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 18 of 32 


qualified privilege” if the complaint had been brought in libel — which it wasn’t. There is no 


holding in Kane applicable to this case. 


C. The Qualified Pre-Litigation Privilege Does Not Exonerate Defendant From Her 
Malicious Defamatory Statements. 


Defendant’s assertion of the “pre-litigation privilege” is misplaced for several reasons, as 
detailed below, but primarily because the pre-litigation privilege is meant to protect parties to a 
justiciable controversy in their attempts to narrow or resolve their claims to avoid litigation. 
Defendant relies upon a vaguely-worded portion of a 2015 statement that she “reserves her right to 


seek redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.”® 


The indeterminate portion of the 
2015 statement does not so much as imply, let alone name, the person or entity against whom 
Defendant has supposedly “reserve[d] the right to seek redress,” nor does it hint at what type of 
“redress” she may seek. This unclear and vaguely-worded statement is insufficient to shroud 
Defendant’s defamatory statements, contained in a press release, with the protection of a qualified 
privilege that is intended to protect parties trying to resolve or narrow their issues in advance of 
litigation. 

Due to that obvious deficiency, Defendant spends many pages of her brief discussing a 
statement she made four years ago, with the hope that the Court will evaluate that statement in 


making a determination on the pre-litigation privilege because she knows that no privilege 


attaches to her 2015 statements. But, no matter how much she references the 2011 statement, it is 


* The January 3, 2015 statement, issued by Ross Gow, Maxwell’s press agent and referred to by Maxwell provides: 
“The allegations made...against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have been 
fully responded to and shown to be untrue. Each time the story is retold it changes, with new salacious details about 
public figures. (The woman’s) claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicized as news, as 
they are defamatory. Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same. Miss 
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavory nature, which have appeared in the British press and elsewhere 
and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such claims.” (emphasis added to mirror quotation in ¥ 30 of 
Plaintiff's Complaint. See McCawley Decl. at Ex. C, January 4, 2015 Express Article. 


13 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 19 of 32 


still not, and never will be, the statement at issue in this case.’ There is no controversy over the 


2011 statement. Ms. Giuffre is bringing suit based on a defamatory statement made in 2015. 


1. Defendant’s Statements Are Outside The Scope Of The “Pre-Litigation” Qualified 
Privilege Because They Are Not Made “Pertinent To Anticipated Good Faith 


Litigation.” 





Defendant’s statements are outside the scope of any pre-litigation privilege because they 
are not pertinent to a good faith anticipated ligation, and because they were made for the improper 
purpose of bullying, harassing, and intimidation. This Court has already held that summary 
judgment based upon an asserted privilege protecting defamatory pre-litigation communications is 
precluded when a plaintiff raises “a genuine issue as to malice and appropriate purpose.” Block, 
691 F. Supp. 685, 699 (Sweet, J.). Defendant’s statements that she is lying and her claims of 
sexual abuse are “obvious lies” are not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation but, instead, 
they were made for an inappropriate purpose, to bully, harass, and intimidate Ms. Giuffre. As pled 
in the Complaint, Defendant knew the statements were false because Defendant engaged in and 
facilitated the sexual abuse of this minor child, therefore, they were made for the inappropriate 
purpose of “bullying,” “harassment,” and “intimidation.” See Front v. Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 720 
(2015). 

Defendant’s statements were a message for the public, not a message to the attorneys for 
the British press. They were also not made by an attorney, but by a press agent, and they did 


nothing to reduce or avoid the need to actually commence litigation because they neither discussed 


° The March 10, 2011 statement provides: “Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about her that have 
appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false. It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms. 
Maxwell’s legal representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be 
withdrawn have simply been ignored. In the circumstances, Ms. Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action 
against those newspapers. ‘I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well know that certain newspapers 
live by the adage, “why let the truth get in the way of a good story”. However the allegations made against me are 
abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask that they stop.’ Said Ghislaine Maxwell. ‘A number of newspapers have shown 
a complete lack of accuracy in their reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation 
or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name.’ she said.” See McCawley Decl. at Ex. B, March 
2011 Statement. 


14 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 20 of 32 


a justiciable controversy with the British press nor demanded that the coverage discontinue. The 
2015, statement plainly shows Defendant using the press to bully, intimidate, and harass Ms. 
Giuffre. 

New York’s pre-litigation qualified privilege does not apply to the facts in this case. 
Historically, statements made in the course of litigation were entitled to privilege from 
defamations claims “so that those discharging a public function may speak freely to zealously 
represent their clients without fear of reprisal or financial hazard.” Jd. at 718. A 2015 New York 
Court of Appeals case somewhat extended this privilege by holding that statements made by 
attorneys prior to the commencement of the litigation are protected by a qualified privilege if those 
statements are pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation. /d. at 718. (“Although it is well- 
settled that statements made in the course of litigation are entitled to absolute privilege, the Court 
has not directly addressed whether statements made by an attorney on behalf of his or her client in 
connection with prospective litigation are privileged” . . . “to advance the goals of encouraging 
communication prior to the commencement of litigation” . . . “we hold that statements made prior 
to the commencement of an anticipated litigation are privileged, and that the privilege is lost 
where a defendant proves that the statements were not pertinent to a good faith anticipated 
litigation.”).'° 
'° The cases cited in Defendant’s own brief in support of this qualified privilege argument all concern actual 
anticipated litigation over a justiciable controversy, where the protected communications involved statements like 
cease and desist letters and counsel’s speech around the courthouse, and they exclusively involve statements made by 
attorneys, or statements to and among parties to the anticipated litigation, and, in one case, the affected malpractice 
insurance carrier. For example in, /nt’l Pub. Concepts, LLC v. Locatelli, the communications at issue concerned cease 
and desist letters written by an attorney. 46 Misc. 3d 1213(A), 9 N.Y.S.3d 593 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2015). Similarly, in 
Frechtman v. Gutterman, the communication at issue was a letter sent by a client to his attorney terminating the 
representation. 115 A.D.3d 102, 103, 979 N.Y.S.2d 58, 61 (2014). In Kirk v. Heppt, the communication at issue was 
made by an attorney’s client to the attorney’s malpractice carrier concerning the client’s justiciable controversy 
against the attorney. 532 F. Supp. 2d 586, 593 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). Finally, Caplan v. Winslet, cited by Defendant, is 
wholly inapposite to Defendant’s argument as the statement at issue was not within the pre-litigation context at all, but 
in the course of ongoing litigation: the alleged defamatory statement was a lawyer-to-lawyer remark made exiting the 


courthouse. 218 A.D.2d 148, 150-51, 637 N.Y.S.2d 967 (1996). None of these cases involved statements that were 
widely publicized. 


15 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 21 of 32 


The Court of Appeals’ reason for allowing this qualified privilege could not be more clear: 
“When litigation is anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to communicate in order to 
reduce or avoid the need to actually commence litigation. Attorneys often send cease and desist 
letters to avoid litigation. Applying privilege to such preliminary communication encourages 
potential defendants to negotiate with potential plaintiffs in order to prevent costly and time- 
consuming judicial intervention.” Jd. at 719-20. 

Under this rationale, the Khalil court found that an attorney’s letters to the potential 
defendant were privileged because they were sent “in an attempt to avoid litigation by requesting, 
among other things, that Khalil return the alleged stolen proprietary information and cease and 
desist his use of that information.” Jd. at 720. Neither the dicta in Khalil, the policy rationale 
discussed, nor the holding suggests that the privilege should apply to a defamatory statement like 
the one at issue in this case. Here, unlike Khalil, the Defendant’s statements were 1) made by a 
non-attorney; 2) concerning a non-party to the alleged anticipated litigation; 3) making a 
knowingly false statement; and 4) that was directed at, and disseminated to, the public at large. 
Defendant’s statements cannot be can be considered “pertinent to a good faith anticipated 
litigation,” such that the qualified privilege should apply. 

Moreover, it strains credulity to ask the Court to somehow read the actionable 2015 press 
release, calling Ms. Giuffre’s sex abuse claims “obvious lies,” as any type of “cease-and-desist” 
statement. This statement was not a communication among the “attorneys and parties,” and it did 
nothing to “reduce or avoid” or resolve any “anticipated” litigation. Indeed, Defendant’s 
statements make no reference to any cause of action, and they lie in stark contrast to the protected 
statements made in Khalil and in all the other cases Defendant cites." 


'' Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites to no case in which this qualified privilege has been extended to internationally 
disseminated press releases slamming a non-party to the “anticipated” litigation. 


16 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 22 of 32 


Most important, Defendant may never prevail in asserting this qualified privilege because, 
in order to invoke this privilege, she must have “meritorious claims” for “good faith” litigation. 
Defendant has neither. Defendant cannot have a “meritorious claim” for “good faith anticipated 
litigation” because Ms. Giuffre’s reports of her sexual abuse are true, Defendant knows that they 
are true, and Defendant made a knowingly false statement when she called Ms. Giuffre a liar. 
Under these circumstances, Defendant has no “meritorious” claim to make in “good faith” relating 
to either Ms. Giuffre’s statements or their coverage in the press, thereby making her defamatory 


statements wholly outside the protection of this qualified privilege. 


2. Defendant’s Statements Are Outside The Scope Of The “Pre-Litigation” Qualified 
Privilege Because They Were Made To Bully, Harass, And Intimidate. 





Khalil specifically states that the qualified privilege “does not protect attorneys who are 
seeking to bully, harass, or intimidate their client's adversaries by threatening baseless litigation or 
by asserting wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact, in violation of counsel's 
ethical obligations.” Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d at 720. Defendant’s defamatory statement, that a sexual 
abuse victim is lying about her abuse, is purposefully calculated to “bully, harass, or intimidate” 
that victim, and keep her silent about Defendant’s wrongdoing. Again, this is an old story. 
Defendant, through her press release, is merely trying to discredit Ms. Giuffre in the public eye, 
and thereby deflect blame; calling Ms. Giuffre a liar has nothing to do with advancing her interest 
in any pretended litigation with the British press. Defendant used the press to defame, discredit, 
and intimidate Ms. Giuffre and, therefore, these statements lie wholly outside the scope of a 
qualified pre-litigation privilege. See also Block, at 699 (Sweet, J.) (denying summary judgment 
on the pre-litigation qualified privilege affirmative defense because there was “‘a genuine issue as 


to malice and appropriate purpose’’). 


17 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 23 of 32 


In sum, the cases cited by both the Court of Appeals in Khalil and by Defendant’s Motion 
to Dismiss applied this privilege only to statements made pertinent to good faith anticipated 
litigation, among interested parties, because this qualified privileged is designed to facilitate the 
negotiation, settlement, or refinement of claims prior to an action being filed. It should not be 
applied to a socialite using her press agent to disseminate defamatory statements to the entire 
world, least of all where it maligns a non-party to alleged anticipated litigation that cannot, in any 
event, be brought in good faith because of Defendant’s personal role in the underlying sexual 
abuse. 

II. Ms. Giuffre Has Properly Pled A Defamation Claim. 

As a fallback argument, Defendant raises various alleged technical deficiencies in Ms. 
Giuffre’s complaints. These arguments, too, are totally without merit. Defendant claims that Ms. 
Giuffre did not provide the “context” of Defendant’s defamatory statement, but (1) a motion to 
dismiss is not a proper vehicle to litigate the “context” in which statements are made, and (2) Ms. 
Giuffre did, in fact, provide sufficient “context” under New York law. What’s more, even if 
further context were appropriate in the pleadings, it would only show that Defendant deliberately 
made false, defamatory, and injurious statements about Ms. Giuffre. Defendant also alleges that 
Ms. Giuffre failed to provide sufficient detail. This claim, too, lacks any merit because the 
Complaint clearly specifies the nature of the statements made by Defendant. 

A. Viewed In Context, Defendant’s Assault On Ms. Giuffre Is Defamatory. 

Defendant asks the Court to conclude, on a motion to dismiss, that “when viewed in 
context, the statements are not actionable defamatory statements.” MTD at p. 17. The Defendant 
does not advise the Court how it could possibly begin to make such a “context” determination. 
Presumably, the Court would have to have the full context for all statements covered by the 


Complaint and then evaluate the context for defamatory meaning. Of course, because Ms. Giuffre 


18 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 24 of 32 


has just filed her Complaint, a fully-developed record does not exist for any such evaluation. The 
Defendant’s argument should be rejected for this reason. 

Defendant also contends that because the Complaint did not set forth the immaterial and 
nonactionable portions of Defendant’s defamatory press release, the Complaint is insufficiently 
pled, but that is not the standard under New York law. The Complaint does not employ “vague 


12 Without specifying “the actual defamatory words,”’* nor does the 


and conclusory allegation[s] 
Complaint fail to “set forth in any manner the words which he claims are actionable so as to give 
defendants notice of the statements at issue,”'* as was the situation in the inapposite cases 
Defendant cites. To the contrary, the Complaint uses direct, word-for-word quotes of Defendant’s 
press statements, giving all the particulars of their origination. For that reason, Ms. Giuffre’s 
Complaint satisfies the pleading requirements.’ 

On the issue of context, this case is most closely akin to the recent New York Court of 
Appeals case Davis v. Boeheim, 24 N.Y .3d 262, 265, 22 N.E.3d 999 (2014). In Boeheim, plaintiffs 
were victims of sexual molestation by Bernie Fine, a former associate head basketball coach for 
Syracuse University. Following plaintiffs’ accusations of sex abuse, James Boeheim, Fine’s 
friend, published statements calling plaintiffs liars, and stating their allegations were financially 
motivated. Plaintiffs sued for defamation. 

The Court of Appeals specifically held that such defamation allegations easily survive a 


motion to dismiss. The Court explained that, on a motion to dismiss, a court “merely examines 


'? Dillon v. City of New York, 261 A.D.2d 34, 39-40, 704 N.Y.S.2d 1 (1999). 
'° Edwards v. Great N. Ins. Co., No. 03cv2947(NG)(RML), 2006 WL 2053717, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July 21, 2006).

aff'd, 108 F.3d 462 (2d Cir. 1997). 


sa Further, the Complaint incorporates by reference the remainder of Defendant’s published statements in the January 
3, 2015, statement. See, e.g., McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at 7 31, 37. All of Defendant’s published statements are 
publically available, and Defendant has full notice of the statements at issue because she issued them to the press and 
Defendant does not deny making them. In an abundance of caution, Plaintiff has the quotes herein and attached the 
press release statements to her declaration as Ex.’s B and C.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 25 of 32 


the adequacy of the pleadings,” asking “whether the contested statements are reasonably 
susceptible of a defamatory connotation.” 22 N.E.3d at 1003. (Internal citations omitted.) The 
Court emphasized that “[i]f, upon any reasonable view of the stated facts, plaintiff would be 
entitled to recovery for defamation, the complaint must be deemed to sufficiently state a cause of 
action.” Jd. The Court minded trial courts to be wary of dismissing claims at the outset in light of 
a plaintiff's “right to seek redress, and not have the courthouse doors closed at the very inception 
of an action, where the pleading meets [the] minimal standard necessary to resist dismissal of [the] 
complaint.” Jd. at 1003-04. 

The Court of Appeals went on to find the complaint fully stated a cause of action because 
statements alleging that a person told lies about accusations of sexual abuse are “susceptible of a 
defamatory connotation” because they “tend[] to expose [Plaintiff] to public contempt, hatred, 
ridicule, aversion or disgrace.” Jd. at 1004. The Court of Appeals also emphasized that the 
statements were defamatory because they “are capable of being proven true or false, as they 
concern whether plaintiffs made false sexual abuse allegations against Fine in order to get money, 
and whether [one of the plaintiffs] had made false statements in the past.” Jd. at 1006. Of course, 
exactly the same points that the Court of Appeals made about the statements attacking the victims 


of Fine apply to Defendant’s statements attacking Ms. Giuffre. 


B. The Complaint Alleges Whom, Where, And In What Manner The January 
Statement Was Made With Specificity And Supporting Facts. 


Ms. Giuffre has pled every element for a cause of action for defamation under New York 
and Colorado law which are substantively similar.'° Under New York law, the elements of a 


defamation claim are: (1) a false statement, published to a third party; (2) without authorization or 


'° The defamatory statements were made in New York, the Defendant resides in New York, and there is no conflict 
between New York and Colorado law, therefore, New York has the most significant interest in the issue of this 
litigation and New York law should apply. Catalanello v. Kramer, 18 F. Supp. 3d 504, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). 


20 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 26 of 32 


privilege; (3) fault, judged at a minimum by a negligence standard; and (4) special harm or 
defamation per se. Dillon v. City of New York, 261 A.D.2d 34 (1999).'” 

Ms. Giuffre has met every requirement in her Complaint. Ms. Giuffre explained in her 
Complaint that she “became a victim of sexual trafficking and repeated sexual abuse after being 
recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when Giuffre was under the age of 
eighteen...Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell, Epstein 
sexually abused Giuffre at numerous locations including his mansions in West Palm Beach, 
Florida, and in this District. With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to sexually abuse 
Giuffre for years until Giuffre eventually escaped.” See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at 4 8, 9 
and 16. With respect to the first elements of a defamation claim, Giuffre has pled a defamatory 
statement concerning another: Defendant stated through her press agent that Ms. Giuffre’s reports 
of her child sexual abuse were “obvious lies.” See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at ¥ 30. 
Second, she has pled publication to a third parties, stating that Defendant’s agent “issued an 
additional false statement to the media and public,” and to “a reporter on a Manhattan street.” Jd. 
at § 30, 4 37. Third, Ms. Giuffre has alleged more than “fault amounting to at least negligence on 
the part of the publisher;” she has alleged malice and that Defendant made the statements 
knowingly because Defendant herself participated in the abuse. See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, 
Compl. at J 9. (“Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell, 
Epstein sexually abused Giuffre at numerous locations including his mansion in West Palm Beach, 
Florida, and in this District.”). Among other similar allegations, the Complaint states: “Maxwell’s 


statements were published intentionally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual 


'" Accord, Lawson v. Stow, 2014 COA 26, 7 15, 327 P.3d 340, 345 (Under Colorado law, the elements of a defamation 
claim are “(1) a defamatory statement concerning another; (2) published to a third party; (3) with fault amounting to at 
least negligence on the part of the publisher; and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special 
damages or the existence of special damages to the plaintiff caused by the publication.”).

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 27 of 32 


abuse and sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and credibility” and that 
Defendant “made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely false. 
Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest degree of 
awareness of falsity.” Compl. at {| 8-9. Fourth, Ms. Giuffre pled defamation per se, alleging that 
the false statements “exposed Giuffre to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and 
induced an evil opinion of her in the minds of right-thinking persons.” Furthermore, the Complaint 
alleges that Defendant’s defamatory statements “tended to injure Giuffre in her professional 
capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking, 
inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation among members of the community that 
seeks her help and that she seeks to serve.” See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at J 11. 

Not only has Ms. Giuffre fully pled defamation, but also the Complaint alleges many 
supporting facts, giving Defendant full notice of the nature of the action. Ms. Giuffre has 
“specif[ied] who made the statements, when they were made, to whom they were made and in 
what context they were made.” Deutsche Asset Mgmt., Inc. v. Callaghan, No. 01 Civ 4426 CBM, 
2004 WL 758303, at *12. As to “who” made the statements, Ms. Giuffre specified that 
Defendant’s “agent, Ross Gow” gave the statement under Defendant’s authority, and that 
Defendant made the statement in Manhattan. See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at 4 29 and § 37. 
As to the “when,” the Complaint alleges the very days they were made: “On or about January 3, 
2014” and “[o]n or about January 4, 2015.” See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at 29 and § 37. 
Additionally, paragraphs 9 through 29 of the Complaint provides ample “context,” narrating the 
factual history of Defendant’s abuse of Ms. Giuffre and referring to Defendant’s statements 
published by the media. These defamatory statements, as alleged in the Complaint, were widely 
disseminated internationally and online, as acknowledged by Defendant in the instant motion. 


MTD at p. 18. Accordingly, not only does the Complaint plead all of the elements of defamation 


22 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 28 of 32 


per se, but it gives ample factual backing to support those elements. Defendant does not deny 
making these statements, nor challenge the accuracy of their dissemination by the media. 

Finally, Defendant’s statements impugning Ms. Giuffre honesty and calling her a liar are 
especially defamatory because they disparage Ms. Giuffre in her profession as president and 
founder of the not-for-profit whose mission is to fight sexual abuse and human trafficking. Celle v. 
Filipino Reporter Enterprises, Inc., 209 F.3d 163, 179-80 (2d Cir. 2000) (“[I]t is actionable 
without proof of damage to say of a physician that he is a butcher ..., of an attorney that he is a 
shyster, of a school teacher that he has been guilty of improper conduct as to his pupils, of a 
clergyman that he is the subject of scandalous rumors, of a chauffeur that he is habitually drinking, 
of a merchant that his credit is bad or that he sells adulterated goods, of a public officer that he has 
accepted a bribe or has used his office for corrupt purposes ... - since these things discredit [one] 
in his chosen calling.”). Defendant’s statements that Ms. Giuffre lied about her own past sex abuse 
discredits Ms. Giuffre in her “chosen calling” and profession of being an advocate for sex abuse 
victims. They paint her as a faker. Defendant’s statements tell the audience that Defendant knows 
that Ms. Giuffre’s professional endeavors are built upon a lie, thus destroying both Ms. Giuffre’s 


reputation and the reputation and credibility of her foundation. 


C. Ms. Giuffre Has Pled Defamation Per Se And Does Not Need To Plead Special 
Damages. 


Ms. Giuffre has sufficiently alleged defamation per se under New York law, suing in libel 
based on Defendant’s published defamatory statements. Ms. Giuffre need not plead or prove 
special damages because the defamatory statements “tend to expose the plaintiff to public 
contempt, ridicule, aversion or disgrace, or induce an evil opinion of [her] in the minds of right- 
thinking person, and to deprive [her] of their friendly intercourse in society.” Matherson v. 


Marchello, 100 A.D.2d 233, 235, 473 N.Y.S.2d 998, 1000-01 (1984). Furthermore, Defendant is 


23 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 29 of 32 


wholly incorrect in stating that a defamation per se claim is limited to professionals who are 
defamed within the context of their profession and suffer damages relating to their profession. 

Here, Defendant confuses, or deliberately conflates, slander and libel, two types of 
defamation with substantially different elements required to state a claim. Defendant cites 
Liberman y. Gelstein, for the proposition that, in order to be actionable, Defendant’s statements 
“must be made with reference to a matter of significance and importance for [the plaintiff's 
profession, trade or office].’” 80 N.Y.2d 429, 431, 605 N.E.2d 344 (1992). However, Liberman 
concerned a slander case. Slander is defamation that is spoken by defendant, and an action lies in 
slander for very limited types of speech. However, those limitations are irrelevant in this case 
because this case concerns libel, a form of defamation that is a written or published statement 
(and, as such, typically far more widely disseminated). Pleading and proving libel per se is not 
limited to the four circumstances required for slander, but has a much broader definition. '® 
Similarly, the other cases cited by Defendant, Thompson v. Bosswick, 855 F. Supp. 2d 67 
(S.D.N.Y. 2012) and Pure Power Boot Camp, Inc. v. Warrior Fitness Boot Camp, LLC, 813 F. 
Supp. 2d 489, 503 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), also concerned slander, not libel and, therefore, their holdings 
are inapplicable. 

Instead, in libel actions, the “challenged language is actionable per se if it tends to expose 
another to ‘public hatred, shame, obloquy, contempt, ridicule, aversion, ostracism, degradation, or 
disgrace’ or ‘to induce an evil opinion of one in the minds of right-thinking persons and to deprive 
one of one's confidence and friendly intercourse in society’ or tends to disparage a person in the 


way of his office, profession or trade.” Idema v. Wager, 120 F. Supp. 2d 361, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) 


'8 <('S]lander per se” consists of statements (i) charging plaintiff with a serious crime; (ii) that end to injure another in 


his or her trade, business or profession; (iii) that plaintiff has a loathsome disease; or (iv) imputing unchastity to a 
woman. Liberman v. Gelstein, 80 N.Y.2d 429, 435, 605 N.E.2d 344 (1992). 


24 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 23 Filed 12/17/15 Page 30 of 32 


aff'd, 29 F. App'x 676 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted); Massre v. Bibiyan, No. 12 CIV. 
6615 KPF, 2014 WL 2722849, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2014). 

Ms. Giuffre has pled libel per se, as the statement that Defendant lied about being a sexual 
abuse victim is more than sufficient to expose her to “public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and 
disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in the minds of right-thinking persons.” See 
McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at § 10. Additionally, Ms. Giuffre pled that “Maxwell’s false 
statements also constitute libel per se inasmuch as they tended to injure Giuffre in her professional 
capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking, 
and inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation among members of the community 
that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve.” See McCawley Decl., Ex. 1, Compl. at ¥ 11. 
Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre has pled libel per se. 

CONCLUSION 
Ms. Giuffre has set forth a well pled claim for defamation. The Court should accordingly 


deny Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss and allow the case to proceed.

COMPLAINT 


Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP 
575 Lexington Avenue 

New York, NY 10022 

(212) 446-2300 


Céssé :14-ncoD7aSRAWS DBoowee? 4-1 Fiteb@G/2/1/14.5 Pkage Bfofa3 


Plaintiff, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts 
(“Giuffre”), for her Complaint against Defendant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL (“Maxwell”), avers 
upon personal knowledge as to her own acts and status and otherwise upon information and 
belief: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 

1. This suit arises out of Defendant Maxwell’s defamatory statements against 
Plaintiff Giuffre. As described below, Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while 
she was a minor child. Defendant Maxwell not only facilitated that sexual abuse but, most 
recently, wrongfully subjected Giuffre to public ridicule, contempt and disgrace by, among other 
things, calling Giuffre a liar in published statements with the malicious intent of discrediting and 
further damaging Giuffre worldwide. 

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 

2. This is an action for damages in an amount in excess of the minimum 
jurisdictional limits of this Court. 

a: This Court has jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332 
(diversity jurisdiction) as Giuffre and Maxwell are citizens of different states and the amount in 
controversy exceeds seventy-five thousand ($75,000), exclusive of interest and costs. 

4. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Maxwell. Maxwell resides in New York 
City, and this action arose, and defamatory statements were made, within the Southern District of 
New York. 

5: Venue is proper in this Court as the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of 


this Court. 


Céssé :14-ncoD7aSRAWS DBoowee? 4-1 Fitekb@G/2/1/14.5 Pkags fof23 


PARTIES 
6. Plaintiff Giuffre is an individual who is a citizen of the State of Colorado. 
7. Defendant Maxwell, who is domiciled in the Southern District of New York, is 
not a citizen of the state of Colorado. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
8. Virginia Giuffre became a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse 


after being recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when Giuffre was under the age 
of eighteen. 

9. Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell, 
Epstein sexually abused Giuffre at numerous locations including his mansions in West Palm 
Beach, Florida, and in this District. Between 2001 and 2007, with the assistance of numerous 
co-conspirators, Epstein abused more than thirty (30) minor underage girls, a fact confirmed by 
state and federal law enforcement. 

10. As part of their sex trafficking efforts, Epstein and Maxwell intimidated Giuffre 
into remaining silent about what had happened to her. 

11. In September 2007, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) 
that barred his prosecution for numerous federal sex crimes in the Southern District of Florida. 

12, In the NPA, the United States additionally agreed that it would not institute any 
federal criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein. 

13. As a co-conspirator of Epstein, Maxwell was consequently granted immunity in 
the Southern District of Florida through the NPA. 

14. Epstein ultimately pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution, and is now a 


registered sex offender. 


Céssé 14-ncoD7ISRAWS DDnowee? 4-1 Fitekb@G/21/14.5 Pkag 4d Sfofa3 


1: Rather than confer with the victims about the NPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
and Epstein agreed to a “confidentiality” provision in the Agreement barring its disclosure to 
anyone—including Epstein’s victims. As a consequence, the victims were not told about the 
NPA. 

16. On July 7, 2008, a young woman identified as Jane Doe No. 1, one of Jeffrey 
Epstein’s victims (other than Giuffre), filed a petition to enforce her rights under the Crime 
Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. ¥ 3771, alleging that the Government failed to 
provide her the rights promised in the CVRA with regard to the plea arrangement with Epstein. 
The litigation remains ongoing. 

i. On or about May 4, 2009, Virginia Giuffre—identified then as Jane Doe No. 
102—filed a complaint against Jeffrey Epstein in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida. The complaint included allegations made by Giuffre that pertained 
to Maxwell. 

18. In pertinent part, the Jane Doe No. 102 complaint described in detail how 
Maxwell recruited Giuffre (who was then a minor girl) to become a victim of sex trafficking by 
introducing Giuffre to Jeffrey Epstein. With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to 
sexually abuse Giuffre for years until Giuffre eventually escaped. 

19. The Jane Doe No. 102 complaint contained the first public allegations made on 
behalf of Giuffre regarding Maxwell. 

20. As civil litigation against Epstein moved forward on behalf of Giuffre and many 
other similarly-situated victims, Maxwell was served with a subpoena for deposition. Her 
testimony was sought concerning her personal knowledge and role in Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre 


and others. 


Céssé :14-mncoD7aSRAWS DBoowee? 4-1 Fitekb@G/2/1/14.5 Pkg Ofof23 


21. To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that 
consequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning. In 
fact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to 
New York. 

22. In 2011, two FBI agents located Giuffre in Australia—where she had been hiding 
from Epstein and Maxwell for several years—and arranged to meet with her at the U.S. 
Consulate in Sidney. Giuffre provided truthful and accurate information to the FBI about 
Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse. 

23: Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that 
she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also 
suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse. 

24. On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims 
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation. 

ao, Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against 
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to 
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of 
sexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex 
trafficking. 

26. On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously 
filed by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein’s non-prosecution 


agreement by filing her own joinder motion. 


Céssé :14-ncoD7ISRAWS DDoowee? 4-1 Fitekb@G/2/1/14.5 Pkg 6 Ofof23 


2d. Giuffre’s motion described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who 
Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and 
participant in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. 

28. In January, 2015, Maxwell undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to 
discredit Giuffre and to so damage her reputation that Giuffre’s factual reporting of what had 
happened to her would not be credited. 

29. As part of Maxwell’s campaign she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to attack 
Giuffre’s honesty and truthfulness and to accuse Giuffre of lying. 

30. On or about January 3, 2015, speaking through her authorized agent, Maxwell 
issued an additional false statement to the media and public designed to maliciously discredit 


Giuffre. That statement contained the following deliberate falsehoods: 


(a) That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” 


(b) That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.” 


(c) That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.” 


31. Maxwell’s January 3, 2015, statement incorporated by reference “Ghislaine 
Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same,” an earlier 
statement that had falsely described Giuffre’s factual assertions as “entirely false” and “entirely 
untrue.” 

32. Maxwell made the same false and defamatory statements as set forth above, in the 
Southern District of New York and elsewhere in a deliberate effort to maliciously discredit 
Giuffre and silence her efforts to expose sex crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, 


Epstein, and other powerful persons. Maxwell did so with the purpose and effect of having 


Céssé :14-ncoD7ISRAWS DBoowee? 4-1 Fiteb@G/21/14.5 Pkg? Sfofa3 


others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further damaged Giuffre’s 
reputation. 

33. | Maxwell made her statements to discredit Giuffre in close consultation with 
Epstein. Maxwell made her statements knowing full well they were false. 

34. Maxwell made her statements maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex 
trafficking crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons. 

a5: Maxwell intended her false and defamatory statements set out above to be 
broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence Giuffre from making further efforts to 
expose sex crimes committed by Maxwell, Epstein, and other powerful persons. 

36. Maxwell intended her false statements to be specific statements of fact, including 
a statement that she had not recruited an underage Giuffre for Epstein’s abuse. Maxwell’s false 
statements were broadcast around the world and were reasonably understood by those who heard 
them to be specific factual claims by Maxwell that she had not helped Epstein recruit or sexually 
abuse Giuffre and that Giuffre was a liar. 

OT; On or about January 4, 2015, Maxwell continued her campaign to falsely and 
maliciously discredit Giuffre. When a reporter on a Manhattan street asked Maxwell about 
Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell, she responded by saying: “I am referring to the statement 
that we made.” The New York Daily News published a video of this response by Maxwell 
indicating that she made her false statements on East 65" Street in Manhattan, New York, within 


the Southern District of New York.

COUNT I 
DEFAMATION 


1. Plaintiff Giuffre re-alleges paragraphs 1 - 37 as if the same were fully set forth 
herein. Maxwell made her false and defamatory statements deliberately and maliciously with the 
intent to intimidate, discredit and defame Giuffre. 

2. In January 2015, and thereafter, Maxwell intentionally and maliciously released to 
the press her false statements about Giuffre in an attempt to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and 
cause her to lose all credibility in her efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. 

a Maxwell additionally released to the press her false statements with knowledge 
that her words would dilute, discredit and neutralize Giuffre’s public and private messages to 
sexual abuse victims and ultimately prevent Giuffre from effectively providing assistance and 
advocacy on behalf of other victims of sex trafficking, or to expose her abusers. 

4, Using her role as a powerful figure with powerful friends, Maxwell’s statements 
were published internationally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual abuse and 
sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and credibility; to cause the world to 
disbelieve Giuffre; and to destroy Giuffre’s efforts to use her experience to help others suffering 
as sex trafficking victims. 

a Maxwell, personally and through her authorized agent, Ross Gow, intentionally 
and maliciously made false and damaging statements of fact concerning Giuffre, as detailed 
above, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere. 

6. The false statements made by Gow were all made by him as Maxwell’s 


authorized agent and were made with direct and actual authority from Maxwell as the principal. 


CdSask 1516/2 233R\RB/ SD doocueme 2411 Axec022217155 Raaged10f d213 


a The false statements that Maxwell made personally, and through her authorized 
agent Gow, not only called Giuffre’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed 
Giuffre to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace. 

8. Maxwell made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely 
false. Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest 
degree of awareness of falsity. 

2. Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel, as she knew that they were going to 
be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print. Maxwell intended her 
false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets internationally, and they 
were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District of New York. 

10. Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel per se inasmuch as they exposed 
Giuffre to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in 
the minds of right-thinking persons. 

11. Maxwell’s false statements also constitute libel per se inasmuch as they tended to 
injure Giuffre in her professional capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed 
to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation 
among members of the community that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve. 

12, Maxwell’s false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out 
against sex trafficking Giuffre acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task. 
Maxwell’s false statements directly and indirectly indicate that Giuffre lied about being recruited 
by Maxwell and sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell’s false statements were 
reasonably understood by many persons who read her statements as conveying that specific 


intention and meaning. 


Céssé :14-mcoD7aSRAWS DDuowee? 4-1 Fitekb@9/21/14.5 Pkeg aC. bioka3 


12: Maxwell’s false statements were reasonably understood by many persons who 
read those statements as making specific factual claims that Giuffre was lying about specific 
facts. 

14. Maxwell specifically directed her false statements at Giuffre’s true public 
description of factual events, and many persons who read Maxwell’s statements reasonably 
understood that those statements referred directly to Giuffre’s account of her life as a young 
teenager with Maxwell and Epstein. 

15: Maxwell intended her false statements to be widely published and disseminated 
on television, through newspapers, by word of mouth and on the internet. As intended by 
Maxwell, her statements were published and disseminated around the world. 

16. Maxwell coordinated her false statements with other media efforts made by 
Epstein and other powerful persons acting as Epstein’s representatives and surrogates. Maxwell 
made and coordinated her statements in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere with 
the specific intent to amplify the defamatory effect those statements would have on Giuffre’s 
reputation and credibility. 

UT Maxwell made her false statements both directly and through agents who, with 
her general and specific authorization, adopted, distributed, and published the false statements on 
Maxwell’s behalf. In addition, Maxwell and her authorized agents made false statements in 
reckless disregard of their truth or falsity and with malicious intent to destroy Giuffre’s 
reputation and credibility; to prevent her from further disseminating her life story; and to cause 
persons hearing or reading Giuffre’s descriptions of truthful facts to disbelieve her entirely. 
Maxwell made her false statements wantonly and with the specific intent to maliciously damage 


Giuffre’s good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts to administer her 


10 


Céssé 14-ncoD7ISRAWS DDuowera? 4-1 Fitekb@9/211/14.5 P&eg4 1 Dfota3 


non-profit foundation, or share her life story, and thereby help others who have suffered from 
sexual abuse. 

18. As a result of Maxwell’s campaign to spread false, discrediting and defamatory 
statements about Giuffre, Giuffre suffered substantial damages in an amount to be proven at trial. 

19. Maxwell’s false statements have caused, and continue to cause, Giuffre economic 
damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and other 
direct and consequential damages and losses. 

20. Maxwell’s campaign to spread her false statements internationally was unusual 
and particularly egregious conduct. Maxwell sexually abused Giuffre and helped Epstein to 
sexually abuse Giuffre, and then, in order to avoid having these crimes discovered, Maxwell 
wantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit Giuffre. In so doing, 
Maxwell’s efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back Giuffre’s 
efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and 
punitive damages are appropriate. 

21. Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Maxwell and 
others from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit Giuffre and other 
victims of sex trafficking. 

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Giuffre respectfully requests judgment against Defendant 
Maxwell, awarding compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an 
amount to be determined at trial, but in excess of the $75,000 jurisdictional requirement; costs of 


suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

LONDON, March 10, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about her that have appeared 


recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false. 


Journalists and Bloggers 


It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking 


for the allegations to be withdrawn have simply been ignored. 


In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against those newspapers. 


“| understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain newspapers live by the adage, "why let the truth 
get in the way of a good story." However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and | ask that they 


stop," said Ghislaine Maxwell.

Ghislaine Maxwell: ‘| was not a madam

SOCIALITE Ghislaine Maxwell dismissed claims yesterday that she 
acted as a “madam” to supply underage girls to US businessman 
Jeffrey Epstein.

Ghislaine Maxwell, pictured with Epstein, says claims against her are ‘lies’ 


The daughter of disgraced Mirror newspapers chief Robert Maxwell said her character had been defamed. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 24-3 Filed 12/17/15 Page 3of3 


Documents lodged with a court in Florida say the 53-year-old introduced her former boyfriend Epstein to powerful 
individuals, including Prince Andrew, after moving to New York in 1991 following the death of her father on his 
yacht. 


According to the documents, a woman identified as Jane Doe 3 says Ms Maxwell asked her to visit Epstein’s 
Florida mansion when she was 15 years old. 


The document says: “Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as they had done with many other 
victims. 


"Maxwell took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls, including Jane Doe 3.” 


When the claims emerged on Friday, her spokesman, Ross Gow, said she would not be commenting and 
referred journalists to a 2011 statement in which she said the allegations against her were “abhorrent”. 


Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same 


Ross Gow 


However, he issued a fresh denial yesterday, saying: ‘The allegations made... against Ghislaine Maxwell are 
untrue. 


Maxwell, a former student at Balliol College, Oxford, is the founder of an environmental charity.

INTRODUCTION 


The primary focus of any defamation claim should be the alleged defamatory statements 
themselves. But Ms. Maxwell’s statements have never been Plaintiffs primary focus in this case. 
Instead, in a transparent attempt to direct the Court’s attention away from the actual issues under 
consideration—whether Ms. Maxwell’s statements are truly defamatory, whether Plaintiff 
properly pled a defamation claim, and whether Ms. Maxwell was privileged to make her 
statements—Plaintiff spends the bulk of her opposition repeating the same conclusory, 
unsupported and false allegations that she was sexually abused by Ms. Maxwell. Plaintiff spends 
the remainder of her opposition selectively misunderstanding applicable federal and New York 
state defamation law. When correctly applying the law, it is clear that there are ample grounds 


for which this Court can, and should, dismiss Plaintiffs claim. 
ARGUMENT 


I. PLAINTIFF FAILED TO PLAUSIBLY PLEAD DEFAMATION 

A. Plaintiff Failed to Adequately Plead a Defamation Claim. 

Apart from bombast, the Complaint fails to adequately plead a defamation claim. First, 
the Complaint’s sentence fragments and selective quotes do not aver any defamatory statement. 
Scholastic, Inc. v. Stouffer, 124 F.Supp.2d 836, 849 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (defamation claim “only 
sufficient if it adequately identifies the purported communication, and an indication of who made 
the communication, when it was made, and to whom it was communicated”); Dillon v. City of 
N.Y., 261 A.D.2d 34, 39-40 (1st Dep’t 1999) (dismissing defamation complaint for, among other 
things, failing to specify the actual defamatory words). The only actual words attributed to Ms. 


99 66 


Maxwell in the Complaint are: “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue,” “shown to be untrue,” 
“claims are obvious lies,” and “I am referring to the statement that we made.” Compl. § 30. 


Beyond that, Plaintiff relies on conclusory, self-serving and in some cases flatly incorrect 


characterizations of the published Statement. The Complaint refers to an “additional false 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 4 of 13 


statement” made on January 3 (Compl. § 30), but never explains the words it was “in addition 
to.” It describes a statement “incorporated by reference” issued “earlier,’ (Compl. { 31), but 
omits the earlier statement and to whom, when or where it was made.' It alleges statements 
made “in the Southern District and elsewhere” by Ms. Maxwell’s agent, Ross Gow, (Compl. 

{9 29, 30, 32), but attaches a 2011 statement attributed to Mr. Gow in London. McCawley Decl., 
Ex. 2. Because the Complaint lacks allegations of the subject Statement, with specificity and in 
context, the defamation claim should be dismissed. 

Second, the Complaint does not contain allegations as to whom statement was made. In 
lieu of that information, Plaintiff offers only who made the statement, a point not in dispute. Pl.’s 
Opp’n at 22. As to whom, she alleges the statements were “widely disseminated” to the “media 
and public.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 22; Compl. { 30. Twice this Court deemed similar pleadings 
insufficient. Hawkins v. City of N.Y., No. 99 Civ. 11704 (RWS), 2005 WL 1861855, at *18 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2005) (pleading fatally defective due to “failure to identify...the individuals to 
whom the statement was allegedly made”); Cruz v. Marchetto, No. 11 Civ. 8378, 2012 WL 
4513484, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2012) (dismissing complaint which “alleges in a conclusory 
manner that... statements . . . ended up in the headlines and quoted in the media’’). 

Third, the Complaint lacks sufficient allegations to establish defamation per se. Plaintiff 
insists that the pleading standard is far more lenient for libel claims than for slander claims. P1.’s 
Opp’n at 24 (citing Liberman v. Gelstein, 80 N.Y.2d 429 (N.Y. 1992)). Not so. Rather, “the 
standard for determining whether a statement concerning a plaintiff's business, profession or 
trade is libelous per se follows the same rules, articulated in Liberman..., as the standard for 
slander per se.” Id. Jewell v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 23 F.Supp.2d 348, 400 (S.D.N.Y 1998). In 


fact, addressing a libel claim, this Court specifically noted that “[d]efamation per se has been 


: Indeed, the Opposition further confounds by disclaiming the Complaint is based on the 2011 statement 
(P1.’s Opp’n at 4, 13 ) but then suggests the Complaint incorporates that very statement (PI.’s Opp’n at 19 & n.15). 


2 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 5 of 13 


defined both as statements that cast doubt on a particular quality at the very heart of the 
profession and statements that impugn the basic integrity of a business.” Kforce, Inc. v. Alden 
Personnel, Inc., 288 F.Supp.2d 513, 516 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). 

Plaintiff nevertheless unsuccessfully attempts to establish a connection between the 
subject Statement and her “profession” by pointing to her incorporation of the Victims Refuse 
Silence, Inc. organization. Pl.’s Opp’n at 25. This is a red herring. No court has recognized 
“victim” as a “profession” as to which a plaintiffs integrity could be impugned. In any event, her 
status as a professional victim only sprang into existence a mere 10 days before the January 3 
Statement was issued. Compl. { 24. Unsurprisingly, the Complaint is devoid of any factual 
allegations that Ms. Maxwell knew about Plaintiff’s newfound “chosen calling,” nor that Ms. 
Maxwell targeted any statement at Plaintiffs “profession.” Thompson v. Bosswick, 855 F. 
Supp.2d 67 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“The statement must be targeted at the specific standards of 
performance relevant to plaintiff's business...”); Thai v. Cayre Grp., Ltd., 726 F.Supp.2d. 323, 
336 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (absence of “facts to support the inference that [the subject] statement 
imputed incompetence, incapacity or unfitness in the performance of [her] profession” as a 
bookkeeper warranted dismissal of defamation per se claim). Consequently, Plaintiff failed to 
adequately plead facts supporting defamation per se or any special damages, and the defamation 
claim should be dismissed. 

B. Ms. Maxwell’s Statement” In Context Is Not Defamatory 


As to defamation claims, the Second Circuit holds “it is for the court to determine in the 





A Plaintiff apparently has abandoned any claim concerning the January 4 oral statement attributed to Ms. 
Maxwell in the Complaint. Cf’ Compl. { 24 (oral statement by Maxwell); Pl.’s Opp’n at 11-12 (contrasting a case 
“that sounded in slander (spoken defamation), whereas this is a libel case (written defamation)”); Jd. at 24 (“[A]n 
action lies in slander for very limited types of speech. However, those limitations are irrelevant in this case because 
this case concerns libel, a form of defamation that is a written or published statement.” ). Plaintiff's Opposition also 
failed to address how that spoken statement could be construed as defamatory. Compare Mot. to Dism. at 5-6, 19-20 
(video published under headline “Ghislaine Maxwell denies comment on allegations she is a madam” not 
defamatory); P1.’s Opp’n (omitting any contrary argument).

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 6 of 13 


first instance whether the words are susceptible of a defamatory meaning.” [dema v. Wager, 29 
Fed.Appx. 676, 678 (2d Cir. 2002). “In performing this task, the court must read the offending 
words in the context of the whole article and test them against the ‘understanding of the average 
reader.’” Jd. (emphasis added). Plaintiff suggests without citation that this contextual reading 
cannot be performed absent “a fully developed record.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 18-19. The numerous 
cases she cites in which courts have been able to perform their evaluation — because the 
complaint included the entire subject statement — belie her claim. While Plaintiff purports to “use 
direct, word-for-word quotes of Defendant’s press statements, giving all the particulars of their 
origination,” (Pl.’s Opp’n at 19), the Complaint shows otherwise. This alone warrants dismissal. 
Dillon, 261 A.D.2d at 39-40 (dismissing defamation claim absent entire subject statement, noting 
“the defect is all the more curious in that [plaintiff] concedes being a recipient of the 
[complained of] letter, presumably enabling him to quote from it at length”). 

In apparent acknowledgement of her error, Plaintiff now includes a fuller version of the 
subject statement “in an abundance of caution” on the last page of her attorney’s declaration. 
McCawley Decl., Ex. 3 at 2. When that statement (still incomplete, with an ellipsis and brackets) 
is read in context, no average reader could reasonably find it defamatory in meaning. First and 
foremost, the Statement is a general denial. No matter how many times Plaintiff baldly asserts 
she was “called a liar” or “dishonest,” the words “liar” or “dishonest” appear nowhere therein. 
Thus, all of Plaintiff's legal arguments concerning the term “liar” are inapposite. Pl.’s Opp’n at 
10-11.° Indeed, the portion of the Statement referencing “obvious lies” immediately follows the 
sentence: “Each time the story is retold it changes, with new salacious details about public 


figures.”” Even Judge Marra noted in his April 7 Order that Plaintiff's latest story involves 


‘ Plaintiff's reference to Brach v. Congregation Yetev Lev D’Satmar, Inc., 696 N.Y.S.2d 496, 498 (2d 
Dep’t 1999), is another example where a court found that the defendant did more than issue a general denial. There, 
the defendant published an article stating that the defendants won a court case “by lies and deceit” and called 
plaintiff a robber. 7d. Plaintiff asks this Court to ignore the significance of the latter statement. 


4 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 7 of 13 


“lurid” claims concerning “numerous American politicians, powerful business executives, 
foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” Menninger Decl., 
Ex. C at 5. Plaintiff's story is palpably incredible, as even Judge Marra suggested in his Order. 
In any event, New York courts uniformly agree general denials cannot alone give rise to 
defamation claims. Indep. Living Aids, Inc. v. Maxi-Aids, Inc., 981 F.Supp.124, 127-28 
(E.D.N.Y. 1997) (“Read in the context of the entire article, [defendant’s] remarks, calling 
[plaintiff] and others ‘liars’ can only be understood as a denial of their accusations.”)*; Porter v. 
Saar, 688 N.Y.S. 2d 137, 139 (1st Dep’t 1999) (“The comments attributed to defendant...in the 
New York Post were in the nature of a general denial of plaintiff[’s] accusations of misconduct, 
not an attack on plaintiffs.”); McNamee v. Clemens, 762 F.Supp.2d 584, 601 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) 
(“[G]Jeneral denials aren’t actionable.”); Davis v. Boeheim, 24 N.Y .3d 262, 271-72 (N.Y. 2014). 
Plaintiff unsuccessfully attempts to analogize the subject Statement to those in Boeheim 
and Clemens. Yet in both cases those statements clearly crossed the line from “general denial to 
specific accusations reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning.” Clemens, 762 F.Supp.2d 
at 601. Ms. Maxwell’s statement does not. First, in Boeheim, the defendant coupled statements 
regarding plaintiff's accusations as “false allegations” and “a lie” with detailed claims regarding 
the accusers as “liars” who were financially motivated. Specifically, Boeheim stated inter alia “I 
believe they saw what happened at Penn State [a similar case of sex abuse], and they are using 
ESPN to get money.” Jd. The N.Y. Court of Appeals while reiterating that “general denials are 
not actionable,” found the assertion plaintiff lied “for monetary gain” would lead a “reasonable 
reader” to believe “the challenged statements were conveying facts about the...plaintiff.” Jd. 


Similarly, in Clemens, the defendant, in addition to denying plaintiff’s allegations, called 


’ Plaintiff attempts to distinguish Independent Living Aids as a slander case. Pl.’s Opp’n at 11-12. Itis a 
distinction without a difference. The allegedly defamatory statements there were contained in an interview intended 
for and ultimately published in a magazine article. 981 F.Supp.at 127-28. The court analyzed the context within 
which the statement was written. Id. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 8 of 13 


plaintiff “troubled and unreliable,” accused him of fabricating evidence, threatened “anybody 
who [believes plaintiff] better start looking for a hell of a good lawyer,” and stated he is 
“constantly lying. . . | warn you five to six months from now, any of you that have jumped on the 
bandwagon that Roger took steroids and assumed anything Brian McNamee had to say will be 
embarrassed.” 762 F.Supp.2d at 591. Based on the aggressive nature of Clemens’ statements 
towards the plaintiff, the court had an easy time concluding they went beyond general denials. Jd. 
at 602. As the court noted, “[Clemens’] statements were direct and often forcefully made, there 
was nothing loose or vague about them.” Id. 

The Statement here stands in stark contrast to Boeheim and Clemens’. Each piece of Ms. 
Maxwell’s alleged Statement shares one important characteristic: it decries Plaintiff's allegations 
as untrue, while saying nothing about Plaintiff herself. Ms. Maxwell never claimed Plaintiff had 
an ulterior motive (Boeheim), or attacked the accuser’s mental state (Clemens), or referred to the 
accuser as a criminal (Brach, a robber; Clemens manufacturing evidence). 

Throughout her Opposition, Plaintiff improperly puts various words in Ms. Maxwell’s 
mouth, e.g., repeatedly attributing to her the words “liar” and “dishonest.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 10-11. 
Of course, she cannot point to any publication in which Ms. Maxwell used those words. By 
Plaintiffs logic, a general denial may give rise to a defamation lawsuit. Pl.’s Opp’n at 10. 
Fortunately, the law provides otherwise. Because Ms. Maxwell simply denied Plaintiff's 
malicious accusations, her Statement is not actionable. See Foretich v. Cap. Cities/ABC, Inc., 37 
F.3d 1541, 1562-63 (4th Cir. 1991) (measured replies non-actionable despite using labels such as 


“heinous lies,” “downright filth,” and “filthy dirt...like from the bottom of a cesspool”). 
Il. MS. MAXWELL’S STATEMENTS ARE PROTECTED BY PRIVILEGE 


A. Qualified Privilege May Form the Basis for a Rule 12(b)(6) Dismissal 


Plaintiff's protestations aside, numerous federal and state courts have dismissed 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 9 of 13 


defamation complaints based on a qualified privilege. See, e.g., Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 
713 (N.Y. 2015) (affirming motion to dismiss based on pre-litigation qualified privilege); 
Orenstein v. Figel, 677 F.Supp.2d 706, 722 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., Inc., v. 
McNulty, 669 F.Supp.2d 405, 415-16 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). While conceding that the absence of 
privilege is an element of defamation, Opp’n at 20-21, Plaintiff nevertheless cites to (primarily 
N.Y. state) cases in which the plaintiffs, unlike herself, properly alleged facts which could serve 
to defeat a qualified privilege. As New York’s highest court found: 

While there are numerous cases in the books in which it is said that 

as to privileged communications the good faith of the defendant 

and the existence of actual malice are questions of fact for the jury, 

the expression must not be misunderstood. Those questions are for 


the jury only where there is evidence in the case warranting their 
submission to the jury, and the burden of proof is on the plaintiff. 


Shapiro v. Health Ins. Plan, 7 N.Y .2d 56, 61 (N.Y. 1959) (emphasis added). As detailed below, 
Plaintiff has failed to carry her pleading burden here. 

B. Ms. Maxwell’s Statements Are Protected by the Self-Defense Privilege 

The long-recognized self-defense privilege “is available to one who has been defamed in 
the first instance, and who, in response to the attack, responds in kind.” Shenkman v. O'Malley, 
2 A.D.2d 567, 574 (1st Dep’t 1956). The “respon[se] in kind” is what is at issue here. Plaintiff 
concedes she began the public verbal assault on Ms. Maxwell. Compl. { 17, 26-27. Plaintiff also 
correctly acknowledges that to defeat the privilege, the Complaint must properly allege it was 
abused. Pl.’s Opp’n at 5. Abuse of privilege in this context requires a showing that the reply (1) 
includes substantial defamatory matter irrelevant or non-responsive to the initial statement; (2) 
includes substantial defamatory material disproportionate to the initial statement; (3) is 
excessively publicized; or (4) is made with malice in the sense of spite or ill will.” Sack, Robert 
D., Sack on Defamation: Libel Slander and Related Problems (Practicing Law Inst., Apr. 2015 


ed.) at Kindle Loc. 20357-20370; Restatement (Second) of Torts, §§ 599, 603-605A (1977). It is 


7 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 10 of 13 


malice prong Plaintiff fundamentally misunderstands and inadequately pleads. 

First of all, the malice, “in the sense of spite or ill will,” must, post-Twombly and Iqbal’, 
be based on “factual content,” not mere “legal conclusions, deductions or opinions couched as 
factual allegations.” Thai v. Cayre Grp., 726 F.Supp.2d at 327; see also Orenstein, 677 
F.Supp.2d at 711 (dismissing conclusory claims of malice where Complaint “provide[d] neither 
factual support for these conclusions nor any explanation of why [defendant] would have an 
interest in acting maliciously toward the [plaintiff]”); Fuji Film, 669 F.Supp.2d at 416 
(dismissing complaint in which “allegations [defendant] acted maliciously are conclusory and 
unsupported by factual allegations).° Here, Plaintiff resorted only to conclusory assertions of 
malice, without factual support. See Compl. {ff 8, 10, 17, 30, 32, 34-35, 37, Count I {J 1-5, 8. 

Second, apart from her conclusory allegations, Plaintiff mistakenly claims she can defeat 
malice simply by asserting the Statement was made with knowledge of its falsity. In the self- 
defense context, not so. As described in Buckley v. Vidal with regard to malice in the context of 
the self-defense privilege: 

The malice issue resolves itself into two questions—was it 
reasonable for [defendant] to believe that his interests in his own 
reputation had been unlawfully invaded by [plaintiff], and was the 


letter which he published in response thereto reasonably necessary 
to defend himself. 


F.Supp. 1051, 1056 (1st Dep’t 1971). In addressing the malice question, the court noted that the 


truth of defendant’s letter was irrelevant. Instead, the letter was privileged because it amounted 


3 Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). 

° Not surprisingly, Plaintiff does not cite to a single federal authority post Twombly and Iqbal in support of 
her argument that a qualified privilege can be defeated at the pleading stage by mere conclusory allegations of 
malice. Pl.’s Opp’n at 7-9. In any event, contrary state cases cited by Plaintiff contained more than conclusory 
allegations of malice. Kamchi v. Weissman, 1 N.Y.S.3d 169, 182 (2d Dep’t 2014) (complaint sufficiently alleged 
malice supported by statements undermining Rabbi’s authority and statements reflecting adversely on his 
competence as a rabbi); Long Marubeni Am. Corp., 406 F.Supp.2d 285, 298 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (malice supported 
“with at least some facts”). Likewise, in Block v. First Blood Assoc., 691 F.Supp. 685, 699-700 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), 
this Court declined to grant summary judgment on the basis of a qualified privilege because “sufficient evidence 
[was] adduced to support the inference that [defendant] acted with malice,” i.e., defendant threatened plaintiff with 
demand for attorneys’ fees, which “may imply an intent to injure”—1.e. malice. Id. 


8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 11 of 13 


to “a tempered and reasoned response...which constituted an appropriate reaction by [defendant] 
to a situation which seemed to threaten his reputation.” Jd. at 1056-57. 

Here, as in Buckley, Ms. Maxwell’s Statement was a “tempered and reasoned response” 
to Plaintiff's vicious character attacks. The Statement addressed only Plaintiff's allegations — 
calling them “untrue” —while avoiding any attack on Plaintiffs character generally. Plaintiff has 
not and cannot point to any facts in the Complaint showing the subject Statement “includes 
substantial defamatory matter that is irrelevant or non-responsive to the initial statement,” or 
“that is disproportionate to the initial statement;” nor that the Statement was excessively 
publicized,” relative to the wide publicity net cast by Plaintiff with her “exclusive interviews” to 
British media and now-stricken litigation declaration. Without any evidence that Ms. Maxwell 
“abused” the self-defense privilege, Plaintiff's conclusory allegations to the contrary fall far 
short of the federal pleading standards of Twombly and Iqbal and should not be accepted as true. 
See Orenstein, 677 F.Supp.2d at 711 (“[Plaintiff] does not allege malice plausibly to overcome 
the qualified privilege.”’); see also Dillon, 704 N.Y.S.2d at 7 (“Actual malice is not supported in 
these pleadings where allegations of ill-will and spite manifested by the letter rest solely on 
surmise and conjecture.”) (emphasis added). 

C. Ms. Maxwell’s Statements Are Protected by the Pre-Litigation Privilege 

Each time Ms. Maxwell issued a statement in response to Plaintiff’s accusations, she 
specifically noted that she would be forced to “seek redress,” including legal redress, upon 
repetition by the press of the accusations. In 2011, Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys informed various 
newspapers she intends to “take legal action” if the newspapers continue to print Plaintiff's 
defamatory accusations. Mot. to Dism. at 14; McCawley Decl., Ex. 2. The January 3 Statement 
reaffirmed her “original response” (from 2011), further noting she “strongly denies allegations of 


an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 25 Filed 12/28/15 Page 12 of 13 


right to seek redress at the repetition of such claims.” Id. at 15; McCawley Decl., Ex. 3. 

New York’s highest court stated recently in Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d at 720, such statements, 
made in anticipation of litigation, are protected by a qualified privilege unless the statements 
were made with the intent to “bully, harass, or intimidate” their adversaries. True to form, 
Plaintiff baldly asserts that the Statement here was made “for an inappropriate purpose, to bully, 
harass, and intimidate Ms. Giuffre.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 14. There is simply no factual basis alleged 
in the Complaint, in Plaintiff's Opposition, or certainly in the Statement itself to evidence such 
an intent. Cf Buckley, supra at 1056 (“There is nothing in either the content or tone of the letter 
which could possibly suggest, as Vidal contends, that Buckley’s intent here was one of 
‘poisoning and closing the available publishing markets of defendant as an author and essayist, 


999 


and so ruining him economically.’”). The privilege therefore applies so as to protect Ms. 


Maxwell from a claim of defamation. 
CONCLUSION 


For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that this Court grant her 


Motion to Dismiss.

PLAIINTIFF, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE’S NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY 


In further support of her Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, 
Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully submits the 
recent decision in Green v. Cosby, 3:14-cv-30211-MGM, 2015 WL 5923553 (D. Mass., Oct. 15, 
2015) (“Cosby”) (attached as Exhibit A). 

In Cosby, the court denied Bill Cosby’s motion to dismiss the sexual assault victim’s 


> ce 


defamation complaint, holding that Cosby’s “suggestion that Plaintiff intentionally lied about 


666 


being sexually assaulted” could expose plaintiff to “‘scorn or ridicule,” and, therefore, Cosby’s 
statement could be found to have a “defamatory meaning.” Green v. Cosby, No. CV 14-30211-

The Cosby decision is relevant to arguments advanced by Defendant in support of her 


motion to dismiss, and therefore, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court take notice of this

Under Florida defamation law, press release in 
which male celebrity criticized women who had 
publicly accused him of sexually assaulting 
them and media for their various roles in recent 
dissemination of sexual assault allegations made 
against him was not a non-actionable statement 
of fact on which defendant based an opinion; 
statement could reasonably be interpreted as 
communicating fact that alleged victims’ 
allegations were false and entirely without merit, 
even though press release contained accurate 
statements regarding length of time between 
when incidents allegedly occurred and date on 
which any particular allegation became public, 
and did not single out any individual by name.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING 
DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS TO DISMISS 
PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT 


MASTROIANNI, United States District Judge 


I. INTRODUCTION 


*1 On December 10, 2014, Tamara Green filed a 
complaint alleging that William H. Cosby, Jr. 
(“Defendant”) publicly defamed her in statements made 
by individuals operating at his direction and/or within the 
scope of their employment. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl.) The 
complaint was subsequently amended to include similar 
claims by two additional plaintiffs, Therese Serignese and 
Linda Traitz (collectively, the three are referred to as 
“Plaintiffs”). (Dkt. No. 13, Am. Compl.) Defendant filed 
motions to dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint in its 
entirety (Dkt. Nos. 21, 22, 23), which Plaintiffs opposed. 
(Dkt. No. 31.) Plaintiffs then sought leave to file a second 


WestlawNext 


amended complaint and, on April 16, 2015, the court 
granted Plaintiffs’ request. Green v. Cosby, 99 F.Supp.3d 
223, —— -—- ——, 2015 WL 1736487, at *2-3 
(D.Mass.2015). Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint 
(“SAC”) supplemented factual allegations with respect to 
an allegedly defamatory statement directed at Green.' 
(Dkt. No. 48, SAC.) The court held a hearing on the 
matter and considered the written filings. 


Il. JURISDICTION 


The SAC contains three defamation counts brought 
pursuant to state law. Defamation is not actionable under 
federal law. Federal courts have jurisdiction over suits 
brought pursuant to state law where there is complete 
diversity of citizenship between the adversaries and the 
amount in controversy exceeds a threshold amount of 
$75,000. 28 U.S.C. § 1332; Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 
U.S. 500, 513, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). 
Based on the content of the complaint, which Defendant 
has not disputed, the court finds Defendant is a citizen of 
Massachusetts and Plaintiffs are citizens of either 
California or Florida. (SAC {J 2, 4-6.) Plaintiffs each 
assert they are entitled to damages in excess of the 
statutory threshold amount. In the absence of any 
challenge from Defendant, the court finds it has 
jurisdiction in this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. 


Ill. MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD 


When considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 
12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court 
must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and draw all 
reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Ashcroft v. 
Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 
868 (2009); see also San Gerénimo Caribe Project, Inc. v. 
Acevedo-Vild, 687 F.3d 465, 471 (1st Cir.2012). The 
burden is on the moving party to demonstrate that even 
when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, 
the complaint lacks “sufficient factual matter” to state an 
actionable claim for relief that is “ ‘plausible on its face.’ 
” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting Bell Atl. 
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 
167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). “A claim has facial plausibility 
when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the 
court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant 
is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Jd. When evaluating 
the sufficiency of the factual allegations contained in the 
complaint, the court must be careful both to credit the 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 9 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


factual assertions made by the plaintiff and to disregard 
“Tt]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, 
supported by mere _ conclusory statements.” Jd. 
“Determining whether a complaint states a plausible 
claim for relief’ is a “context-specific task that requires 
the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and 
common sense.” Jd. at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937. A complaint 
must survive a motion to dismiss if the facts alleged are 
sufficient as to each element to “raise a right to relief 
above the speculative level.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 
127 S.Ct. 1955; see also Lister v. Bank of Am., N.A., 790 
F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir.2015) (“Dismissal for failure to state 
a claim is appropriate if the complaint does not set forth 
factual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting 
each material element necessary to sustain recovery under 
some actionable legal theory.” (internal quotation marks 
omitted)). 


IV. FACTS AS ALLEGED BY PLAINTIFFS’ 


*2 During the 1970s, Defendant, “an internationally 
known actor and comedian,” met each Plaintiff and 
subsequently sexually assaulted her. (SAC {J 3, 7, 18-21, 
39, 47-48, 57, 63.) With respect to Plaintiff Green, “[o]n a 
certain date in the early 1970s,” Defendant offered her 
two pills, telling her they were over-the-counter cold 
medicine. (/d. J{[ 10, 12.) She took the pills and became 
weak and dizzy. Ud. §| 13-14.) Defendant then drove 
Plaintiff Green to her apartment, where he subjected her 
to sexual contact against her will and despite her repeated 
demands to stop. Ud. J§ 17-21.) Plaintiff Green was 
unable to defend herself during the sexual assault because 
she remained weak and vulnerable. (Jd. { 22.) 


In 1970, Plaintiff Traitz met Defendant while working as 
a waitress. (Id. { 57.) On one occasion she accepted a ride 
home from Defendant, but he instead drove her to a 
beach. (/d. {| 58-59.) He parked his car and then opened a 
briefcase containing pills and urged Plaintiff Traitz to take 
some pills “to relax.” (/d. { 60.) When Plaintiff Traitz 
declined the pills, Defendant groped her, pushed her 
down, and attempted to lie on top of her, despite her 
resistance. (Id. [| 62-63.) 


Plaintiff Serignese met Defendant in Las Vegas in 1976 
and attended his show. (/d. [{ 39, 42-43.) Afterwards, she 
was invited to a room backstage where Defendant gave 
her two pills and instructed her to take them. (/d. {J 
43-44.) Plaintiff Serignese complied and the pills caused 
her to be in an altered state of consciousness. (Jd. {J 
44-45.) While she was in this altered state, Defendant 
subjected her to sexual contact without her consent. (Jd. 


WestlawNext 


Wl 47-48.) Like Plaintiff Green, Plaintiff Serignese was 
physically unable to defend herself. (Id. J 49.) 


Many years later, in February of 2005, the Philadelphia 
Daily News published an interview with Plaintiff Green in 
which she publicly disclosed the sexual assault that had 
occurred in the 1970s. (/d. {| 24.) Plaintiff Green also 
disclosed the allegations during appearances on television 
shows around the same time. (/d.) Nine years later, on or 
about February 7, 2014, Newsweek published an interview 
with Plaintiff Green in which she repeated her description 
of being sexually assaulted by Defendant in the 1970s. 
(Id. J 27.) 


On November 18, 2014, Plaintiff Traitz made an entry on 
her personal Facebook page publicly disclosing that 
Defendant had sexually assaulted her. (id. J 64.) The 
following day, Plaintiff Serignese publicly disclosed that 
she had been sexually assaulted by Defendant.’ (Id. J 50.) 
Several days later, on November 22, 2014, details of 
Plaintiff Green’s sexual assault were published by the 
Washington Post. (Id. J 31.) 


Plaintiffs allege that Defendant, acting through his 
agents,’ issued statements to the media in response to the 
public disclosures made by Plaintiffs. (Ud. Jl 25-26, 
28-29, 30, 32-35, 37-38, 51-53, 55-56, 65-68, 70-71.) 
Defendant knew each statement was false at the time it 
was made. (/d. Jf 36, 54, 69, 79, 90, 101.) Despite 
knowing the statements were false, Defendant directed the 
statements be made. (/d. {§| 37, 55, 70.) Each of the 
statements was widely read by many people, including 
Plaintiffs’ families, friends, and neighbors, and Plaintiffs 
suffered damages, including to their reputations, as a 
result of the publication of the statements. (/d. J 38, 56, 
71, 80-82, 91-93, 102-104.) The statements were made as 
follows: 


A. Newsweek Statement—February 7, 2014 

*3 Prior to the publication of Newsweek’s interview with 
Plaintiff Green in February of 2014, Defendant, acting 
through a publicist, believed by Plaintiffs to be David 
Brokaw (“Brokaw”), made a statement to Newsweek. (Id. 
¥{_ 28-30.) The publicist provided the statement to 
Newsweek while acting as Defendant’s authorized agent, 
employee, or authorized representative and he knew or 
should have known the statement was false when it was 
made. (/d. [| 29, 77-78) The statement was appended to 
the end of the story and read, in its entirety: 


This is a 10-year-old, discredited 
accusation that proved to be 
nothing at the time, and is still 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 10 of 26

nothing. 


(Dkt. No. 25, Decl. re: Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss 
(“Decl. re: Mot. to Dismiss”), Ex. A at 3, hereinafter 
“Newsweek Statement.’’) 


B. November 20, 2014 Statement 

Two days after Plaintiff Traitz wrote on her personal 
Facebook page about Defendant sexually assaulting her in 
the 1970s, Defendant, acting through Martin D. Singer 
(“Singer”), released a responsive statement to numerous 
media outlets. (SAC { 65.) Singer gave the statement 
while acting as Defendant’s authorized agent, employee, 
or authorized representative and he knew or should have 
known the statement was false when it was made. (Jd. 
53, 99-100.) The statement read, in its entirety, as 
follows: 


Ms. Traitz is the latest example of people coming out 
of the woodwork with fabricated or unsubstantiated 
stories about my client. 


Linda Joy Traitz is making ridiculous claims and 
suddenly seems to have a lot to say about a fleeting 
incident she says happened with my client more than 
40 years ago, but she hasn’t mentioned either her 3 
year incarceration or her extensive criminal record with 
charges spanning from the 1980’s through 2008. 


For the first time, she is claiming that in approximately 
1970, my client supposedly drove her to the beach and 
had a briefcase filled with drugs and offered her pills to 
relax, which she says she turned down and demanded 
to be taken home after Mr. Cosby came on to her. 
There was no briefcase of drugs, and this is an absurd 
fabrication. 


Ms. Traitz’s long criminal record for numerous 
offenses including charges for criminal fraud, 
possession of Oxycodone, cocaine possession, 
marijuana possession, and possession of drug 
paraphernalia, speaks for itself. 


As the old saying goes, “consider the source.” 


(Decl. re: Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. F at 1, hereinafter 
“November 20, 2014 Statement.’’) 


C. November 21, 2014 Statement 
On November 21, 2014, Defendant, again acting through 
Singer, released a responsive statement to numerous 


WestlawNext 


media outlets. (SAC Jf 51, 67.) Singer gave the statement 
while acting as Defendant’s authorized agent, employee, 
or authorized representative and he knew or should have 
known the statement was false when it was made. (Jd. 
53, 88-89, 99-100.) The statement responded to 
allegations by Plaintiffs Traitz, Serignese, and other 
individuals who are not parties to this suit, without 
directly identifying any individuals by name, and read, in 
its entirety, as follows: 


The new, never-before-heard claims from women who 
have come forward in the past two weeks with 
unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they 
say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have 
escalated far past the point of absurdity. 


These brand new claims about alleged decades-old 
events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is 
completely illogical that so many people would have 
said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law 
enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought 
they had been assaulted over a span of so many years. 


*4 Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye 
every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers 
willing to represent people with claims against rich, 
powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of 
these new women who just came forward for the first 
time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time 
they allege they had been sexually assaulted. 


This situation is an unprecedented example of the 
media’s breakneck rush to run stories without any 
corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic 
standards. Over and over again, we have refuted these 
new unsubstantiated stories with documentary 
evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop 
up out of the woodwork. When will it end? 


It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. 
Cosby to stop. 


(Decl. re: Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. D at 1, hereinafter 
“November 21, 2014 Statement.’’) 


D. Washington Post Statement, November 22, 2014 

On November 22, 2014, the Washington Post published 
its interview with Plaintiff Green, along with a responsive 
statement from Defendant. (SAC {{ 31-33.) Defendant, 
acting through Walter M. Phillips Jr. (“Phillips”), either 
“gave” the statement to the Washington Post in 2014, or 
“originally published” the statement in 2005 with the 
expectation and intent that the statement be republished if 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 11 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


Plaintiff Green’s allegations were reported again in the 
future, as occurred in November of 2014. (/d. J{| 34-35.) 
Phillips provided the statement while acting as 
Defendant’s authorized agent, employee, or authorized 
representative and he knew or should have known the 
statement was false when it was made. (/d. J 26, 77-78.) 
The article quoted Phillips as stating Plaintiff Green’s 
allegations were “absolutely false.” (Dkt. No. 20, Pls.’ 
Mem. Supp. re: Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. 
Compl. (“Mem. re: Mot. to Am.”) 15, Exs. B and C.) 
Phillips also stated: “Mr. Cosby does not know the name 
Tamara Green or Tamara Lucier [her maiden name] and 
the incident she describes did not happen.” (d.) In 
addition, Phillips stated the publication of “an 
uncorroborated story of an incident that is alleged to have 
happened thirty years ago” was “irresponsible.” (Id.)° 


The Washington Post publishes articles both online and in 
print. The online version of the article is dated November 
22, 2014 (“November 22, 2014 Washington Post Online 
Article”) and the print version is dated November 23, 
2014 (“November 23, 2014 Washington Post Print 
Article”). (Mem. re: Mot. to Am., Exs. B and C.) In the 
November 23, 2014 Washington Post Print Article, 
Phillips is identified as “[a]nother Cosby attorney” and 
the statement is identified as having been “issued this past 
week.” (Mem. re: Mot. to Am., Ex. B.) After publishing 
the original articles, the Washington Post issued slightly 
different correction notices with respect to both the online 
and print versions of the article, and, by December 12, 
2014, had incorporated the correction itself into the body 
of the November 22, 2014 Washington Post Online 
Article. (Mem. re: Mot. to Am, Ex. C; Dkt. No. 28, Decl. 
re: Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. 
Compl., Ex. 1.) Plaintiffs attached a copy of the corrected 
version of the November 22, 2014 Washington Post 
Online Article, which included the correction notice at the 
top of the article, as an exhibit in support of their motion 
for leave to file a second amended complaint. (Mem. re: 
Mot. to Am., Ex. C.) In this corrected version of the 
November 22, 2014 Washington Post Online Article, 
dated December 12, 2014, the text has been changed from 
the print version® to identify Phillips as “[a] previous 
Cosby attorney” and the statement is identified as having 
been “issued in 2005 when the allegations first surfaced.” 
(Id. at 15.) The correction notice to the online version 
reads in its entirety: “This story originally said Cosby 
lawyer Walter M. Phillips Jr. had denied the allegations of 
Tamara Green in a statement issued during the past week. 
The statement was made when Green’s allegations first 
surfaced in 2005. The story has been corrected.” (/d. at

V. DISCUSSION 


A. Choice of Law 

*5 ll 2ltFlederal courts sitting in diversity apply state 
substantive law and federal procedural law.” Gasperini v. 
Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427, 116 S.Ct. 
2211, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996). The court “determine[s] 
which state’s law applies by applying the choice of law 
rules of the forum state,” in this case, Massachusetts. /n re 
Volkswagen & Audi Warranty Extension Litig., 692 F.3d 
4, 14 (1st Cir.2012). In tort cases, Massachusetts courts 
“consider choice-of-law issues ‘by assessing various 
choice-influencing considerations,’ ... including those 
provided in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws 
(1971).” Cosme v. Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., 417 Mass. 
643, 632 N.E.2d 832, 834 (1994) (internal citation 
omitted) (quoting Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 
393 Mass. 622, 473 N.E.2d 662, 668 (1985)). 


SlPursuant to section 150 of the Restatement (Second) of 
Conflict of Laws, “the law of the state where the defamed 
person was domiciled at the time of publication applies ‘if 
the matter complained of was published in that state.’ ” 
Davidson v. Cao, 211 F.Supp.2d 264, 274 (D.Mass.2002) 
(quoting Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws § 150(2) 
& cmt. b). The statements at issue in this case were 
published nationally, so the court applies the law of the 
state in which each Plaintiff was domiciled when the 
alleged publication occurred. Accordingly, California law 
applies relative to the claims of Plaintiff Green and 
Florida law applies as to the claims of Plaintiffs Traitz 
and Serignese. 


B. Statute of Limitations as to Claim Based on the 
Washington Post Statement 

The original cause of action asserted by Plaintiff Green 
referred to allegedly defamatory statements made by 
Defendant, through his agents, published in Newsweek 
and the Washington Post in 2014. Two days after this 
action was filed, the Washington Post issued the 
corrections indicating Phillips’ statement (on behalf of 
Defendant) had actually been made in 2005 when Plaintiff 
Green first publicly disclosed the alleged sexual assault, 
and not in 2014 after Green publicly repeated these 
allegations. Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed the SAC, in which 
they continued to allege that Defendant, through Phillips, 
“gave” the statement to the Washington Post in 2014. 
(SAC { 34.) The SAC also alleges “[i]n addition, or in the 
alternative,” that the statement was originally published in 
2005 with Defendant’s “expectation and intent that the 
statement would be republished by news outlets in the 
event that Plaintiff Green should repeat her accusations, 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 12 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


and/or should these accusations be reported again, on a 
later date.” (/d. J 35.) Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege, “it 
was reasonably foreseeable” that Defendant’s 2005 
statement would be republished by news media in stories 
regarding Green’s repeated allegations, including the 
November 22, 2014 Washington Post article. (Id.) 


Defendant argues Plaintiff Green’s claim based on the 
November 22, 2014 Washington Post article is barred by 
the statute of limitations. (Dkt. No. 24, Def.’s Mem. Supp. 
of Mots. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Mem.”) 9-11); Dkt. No. 27, 
Def.’s Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. 
Compl.) California has adopted a one-year statute of 
limitations for defamation claims. See Cal. Code Civ. Pro. 
§ 340(c). According to Defendant, the “single publication 
tule” mandates that the limitations period commences on 
the date the statement was first published, in this case 
2005, thereby rendering Green’s claim untimely. 


As an initial matter, the parties contest whether the court 
may even consider the Washington Post correction in 
ruling on Defendant’s motion to dismiss. According to 
Plaintiffs, because the correction contains no actionable 
defamatory language, it is not central to Green’s claim 
and thus is not incorporated into the pleadings. Plaintiffs, 
however, attached a copy of the corrected November 22, 
2014 Washington Post Online Article as an exhibit in 
support of their motion for leave to file a second amended 
complaint. (Mem. re: Mot. to Am., Ex. C.) Plaintiffs 
cannot rightfully have benefited from their own reliance 
on the correction and then assert they should also be 
shielded from what it says. Accordingly, while Plaintiffs 
did not attach the correction to the SAC following the 
court’s allowance of their motion for leave to amend, the 
court believes, as a matter of fair and practical application 
of Rule 10(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 
their strategic use of that correction should have the same 
effect. See Trans—Spec Truck Serv. v. Caterpillar Inc., 
524 F.3d 315, 321 (1st Cir.2008) (“Exhibits attached to 
the complaint are properly considered part of the pleading 
‘for all purposes’ including Rule 12(b)(6).” (quoting Fed 
R. Civ. P. 10(c))); West v. Temple, Civil Action No. 
5:14-CV-86 (MTT), 2015 WL 757650, at *4 (M.D. Ga. 
Feb. 23, 2015) (“The Court will consider the information 
contained in the ‘carbon-copy grievance’ attached to [the 
plaintiff's] motion to amend as part of his Complaint.”); 
cf. Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., 949 F.2d 42, 
48 (2d Cir.1991) ( “[T]he problem that arises when a 
court reviews statements extraneous to a complaint 
generally is the lack of notice to the plaintiff that they 
may be so considered; it is for that reason—requiring 
notice so that the party against whom the motion to 
dismiss is made may respond—that Rule 12(b)(6) 
motions are ordinarily converted into summary judgment 


VWestlawNext 


motions. Where plaintiff has actual notice of all the 
information in the movant’s papers and has relied upon 
these documents in framing the complaint the necessity of 
translating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into one under Rule 56 
is largely dissipated.”). At the very least, therefore, the 
court believes it may consider the correction to the 
November 22, 2014 Washington Post Online Article, 
even though Plaintiffs did not formally attach it to the 
SAC.® 


*6 Plaintiffs next assert that even if the court considers 
the correction, it is not inconsistent with the allegation in 
paragraph 34 of the SAC that Phillips in 2014 “gave” the 
Washington Post the statement, even if it was originally 
published in 2005.° Defendant, on the other hand, 
contends Plaintiffs’ allegation is contradicted by the 
correction and the court cannot now credit their 
allegation. See Yacubian v. United States, 750 F.3d 100, 
108 (1st Cir.2014) (“ ‘[W]hen a written instrument 
contradicts allegations in the complaint to which it is 
attached, the exhibit trumps the allegations.’ ” (quoting 
Young v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 717 F.3d 224, 229 n. 1 
(1st Cir.2013))). The court agrees with Plaintiffs that the 
correction is not necessarily inconsistent with the 
allegation that Defendant (through Phillips) “gave” the 
statement to the Washington Post in 2014. The term 
“gave” does not necessarily mean verbally speaking the 
words but could be taken to mean, at this stage of the 
litigation, that Defendant’s agent referred the Washington 
Post to the old statement or otherwise made the 
newspaper aware of the statement. Defendant asserts that 
because this allegation is “threadbare” and “speculative,” 
the court should disregard it. See Penalbert—Rosa v. 
Fortuno—Burset, 631 F.3d 592, 595 (1st Cir.2011). The 
Supreme Court has explained, however, that “the pleading 
standard Rule 8 announces does not require ‘detailed 
factual allegations.’ ” Igbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 
1937 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). 
Plaintiffs have explained in their opposition to dismissal 
that paragraph 34 of the SAC should be read to mean 
“that in November of 2014, Mr. Phillips gave the 
Washington Post a copy of a statement that he originally 
published in 2005; or that, in November of 2014, Mr. 
Phillips directed the Washington Post to republish the 
older statement.” (Dkt. No. 32, Pls.” Mem. Supp. Opp’n 
to Def.’s Mots. to Dismiss (“Pls.’” Mem.) 32-33.) See 
Penalbert-Rosa, 631 F.3d at 596 (indicating that a 
plaintiff may supply a missing detail in an opposition to a 
motion to dismiss). Plaintiffs also argue the Washington 
Post, in 2014, originally reported in an unambiguous way 
the statement had been “issued this past week.” At this 
stage of the litigation, before the commencement of the 
discovery process, this provides a good-faith basis for 
Plaintiffs to allege Defendant, through an agent, by some 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 13 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


means “gave” the statement to the newspaper in 2014. See 
Rodriguez—Vives v. P.R. Firefighters Corps, 743 F.3d 
278, 286 (1st Cir.2014) (explaining that the “threadbare” 
and “speculative” exception to assuming a plaintiff’s 
factual allegations as true only applies when it is “clear 
that the plaintiff is merely speculating about the fact 
alleged and therefore has not shown that it is plausible 
that the allegation is true”). 


The online correction merely states “the statement was 
made when Green’s allegations first surfaced in 2005.” 
(Mem. re: Mot. to Am., Ex. C.) This does not rule out the 
possibility, consistent with paragraph 34 of the SAC, that 
although Phillips originally “made” the statement in 2005, 
he also provided or directed the same statement to the 
Washington Post in 2014 in response to Green’s more 
recent public accusations. See Shively v. Bozanich, 31 
Cal.4th 1230, 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576,80 P.3d 676, 683 (2003) 
(“The rule that each publication of a defamatory statement 
gives rise to a new cause of action for defamation applies 
when the original defamer repeats or recirculates his or 
her original remarks to a new audience.”). The discovery 
process may very well bear this issue out and sharpen the 
parties’ arguments on this point, but at this stage the court 
must resolve all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs’ 
favor."° Dismissal of a portion of Plaintiff Green’s claim 
based on a correction made to the Washington Post article 
is not warranted on statute of limitations grounds. 


(41 SlMost importantly, even if Defendant’s reading of the 
correction were accurate and the court declined to accord 
paragraph 34 of the SAC the presumption of truth, 
Defendant’s statute of limitations argument would still 
fail based on Plaintiffs’ theory asserted in paragraph 35 of 
the SAC. As discussed, Plaintiffs allege in paragraph 35, 
“[iJn addition, or in the alternative, to paragraph 34,” that 
Phillips “originally published” the statement in 2005 
“with the expectation and intent” that the statement be 
republished if Plaintiff Green’s allegations were reported 
again in the future. (SAC J 35.) “In general, the repetition 
by a new party of another person’s earlier defamatory 
remark also gives rise to a separate cause of action for 
defamation against the original defamer, when the 
repetition was reasonably foreseeable.” Shively, 7 
Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 683; see also Mitchell v. 
Superior Court, 37 Cal.3d 268, 208 Cal.Rptr. 152, 690 
P.2d 625, 633 (1984) (“According to the Restatement 
(Second) of Torts (1977) section 576, the original defamer 
is liable if either ‘the repetition was authorized or 
intended by the original defamer’ (subd. (b)) or ‘the 
repetition was reasonably to be expected’ (subd. (c)). 
California decisions follow the restatement rule.’”’); 
Schneider v. United Airlines, Inc., 208 Cal.App.3d 71, 
256 Cal.Rptr. 71, 74 (1989) (“[T]he originator of the 


WestlawNext 


defamatory matter can be liable for each ‘repetition’ of 
the defamatory matter by a second party, ‘if he could 
reasonably have foreseen the repetition.’ ” (quoting 
McKinney v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 110 Cal.App.3d 787, 
168 Cal.Rptr. 89, 93 (1980))). “It is the foreseeable 
subsequent repetition of the remark that constitutes 
publication and an actionable wrong in this situation, even 
though it is the original author of the remark who is being 
held accountable.” Shively, 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 
683. The court does not agree with Defendant’s assertion 
that, under the “single publication rule,” Plaintiff Green’s 
defamation claim accrued exclusively in 2005 and the 
limitations period did not reset upon the issuance of the 
November 22, 2014 Washington Post article. 


*7 In Shively, the California Supreme Court extensively 
set forth the history and rationale of the single publication 
tule. The court explained: 


Under the common law as it existed 
in the 19th century and early part of 
the 20th century, the principle that 
each communication of a 
defamatory remark to a new 
audience constitutes a separate 
“publication,” giving rise to a 
separate cause of action, led to the 
conclusion that each sale or 
delivery of a copy of a newspaper 
or book containing a defamation 
also. constitutes a separate 
publication of the defamation to a 
new audience, giving rise to a 
separate cause of action for 
defamation. ... This conclusion had 
the potential to subject the 
publishers of books and 
newspapers to lawsuits stating 
hundreds, thousands, or even 
millions of causes of action for a 
single issue of a periodical or 
edition of a book. This conclusion 
also had the potential to disturb the 
repose that the statute of limitations 
ordinarily would afford, because a 
new publication of the defamation 
could occur if a copy of the 
newspaper or book were preserved 
for many years and then came into 
the hands of a new reader who had 
not discovered it previously. The 
statute of limitations could be 
tolled indefinitely, perhaps forever, 
under this approach. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 14 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


(l7g., 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 683-84 (internal 
citations omitted). In response to these concerns, “courts 
fashioned what became known as the single-publication 
tule, holding that, for any single edition of a newspaper or 
book, there was but a single potential action for a 
defamatory statement contained in the newspaper or book, 
no matter how many copies of the newspaper or the book 
were distributed.” /d., 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 684." 
Critically, however, “[nJotwithstanding the 
single-publication rule, a new edition or new issue of a 
newspaper or book still constitutes a new publication, 
giving rise to a new and separate cause of action and a 
new accrual date for the purpose of the statute of 
limitations.” Id., 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 685, n. 7; 
see also id., 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 685 (“Accrual 
at that point is believed to provide adequate protection to 
potential plaintiffs, especially in view of the qualification 
that repetition of the defamatory statement in a new 
edition of a book or newspaper constitutes a new 
publication of the defamation that may give rise to a new 
cause of action, with a new accrual date.”). 


Therefore, if Green had asserted a claim based merely on 
the original 2005 article containing Phillips’ statements, 
the single publication rule would operate to bar such a 
claim because accrual would have occurred “on the ‘first 
general distribution of the publication to the public.’ ” Jd., 
7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 685 (quoting Belli v. 
Roberts Bros. Furs, 240 Cal.App.2d 284, 49 Cal.Rptr. 
625, 629 (1966)). Because Green’s claim is instead based 
on the November 22, 2014 Washington Post article, an 
entirely different issuance, the single publication rule does 
not apply. See id., 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 685 & n. 
7; Schneider, 256 Cal.Rptr. at 74-75 (“ ‘[T]he single 
publication rule ... does not include separate aggregate 
publications on different occasions.’ ” (quoting Kanarek 
v. Bugliosi, 108 Cal.App.3d 327, 166 Cal.Rptr. 526, 530 
(1980))); cf. Christoff v. Nestle USA, Inc., 47 Cal.4th 468, 
97 Cal.Rptr.3d 798, 213 P.3d 132, 138 (2009) (“The 
prefatory note to the uniform act states that under the 
single-publication rule ‘any single integrated publication, 
such as one edition of a newspaper or magazine, or one 
broadcast, is treated as a unit, giving rise to only one 
cause of action.” ” (quoting Unif. Single Publ’n Act, 14 
U.L.A. 469 (2005))). Accordingly, Defendant has not 
established that Plaintiff Green’s claim based on the 
November 22, 2014 Washington Post article is barred by 
California’s statute of limitations and, consistent with 
paragraph 35 of the SAC, he may be held liable for the 
foreseeable republication of Phillips’ 2005 statement. See 
Shively, 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 576, 80 P.3d at 683. 


*8 Accordingly, the court will not dismiss any portion of 


WestlawNext 


Plaintiff Green’s claim based on a single publication 
theory that the statute of limitations has expired. 


C. Adequacy of Plaintiffs’ Defamation Allegations 
Having determined the laws of California and Florida 
are applicable and that the claim related to the 
Washington Post Statement is not barred by the statute of 
limitations, the court next considers the substance of 
Plaintiffs’ defamation claims. Both California and Florida 
recognize the following essential elements of defamation: 
(1) a publication; (2) that is false; (3) defamatory, 
meaning damaging to the good reputation of the person 
who is the subject of the statement; (4) made by an actor 
with the requisite degree of fault; (5) is not protected by 
any privilege; and (6) causes injury to the subject.” See, 
e.g., Jews For Jesus, Inc. v. Rapp, 997 So.2d 1098, 1106 
(Fla.2008); Taus v. Loftus, 40 Cal.4th 683, 54 Cal.Rptr.3d 
775, 151 P.3d 1185, 1209 (2007), abrogated on other 
grounds by Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman, 51 
Cal.4th 811, 124 Cal.Rptr.3d 256, 250 P.3d 1115 (2011); 
Blatty v. N.Y. Times Co., 42 Cal.3d 1033, 232 Cal.Rptr. 
542, 728 P.2d 1177, 1182-83, 1186 (1986). Defendant 
moves to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, alleging inadequacies 
related to several of these elements. These challenges can 
generally be organized as follows. First, Defendant asserts 
that none of the allegedly defamatory statements contain 
false factual assertions that are also defamatory. As part 
of this argument, Defendant specifically asserts the claim 
based upon the November 20, 2014 Statement regarding 
Plaintiff Traitz fails because the statement was 
substantially true and the claims based upon the 
November 21, 2014 Statement fail because that statement 
was not sufficiently “of and concerning” Plaintiffs Traitz 
or Serignese. Second, Defendant argues he cannot be 
liable for defamation because Plaintiffs have failed to 
plead that either Defendant or his agents acted with the 
constitutionally required degree of fault. Third, Defendant 
argues the November 20, 2014 Statement did not cause 
Plaintiff Traitz to suffer incremental harm. Fourth, 
Defendant asserts the allegedly defamatory statements are 
protected by a “self-defense privilege.” The court 
addresses these arguments in turn. 


1. The Statements: Factual, True, Defamatory, Of and 
Concerning 


(8lfy order for a defamation claim to survive a motion to 
dismiss, the allegedly defamatory statement must contain 
at least one false factual assertion which is also 
defamatory. See, e.g., Jews For Jesus, Inc., 997 So.2d at 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 15 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


1106; Taus, 54 Cal.Rptr.3d 775,151 P.3d at 1209. 
Depending on the nature of the statement and the context 
in which it was made, courts will place different emphasis 
on these two components. In this case, Defendant argues 
three of the four statements at issue do not contain factual 
assertions that are false, or even capable of being false." 
Defendant further asserts that even if the statements can 
be understood as expressing false factual assertions, they 
are not defamatory because they do not hold Plaintiffs “ 
‘up to contempt, hatred, scorn, or ridicule or tend to 
impair [their] standing in the community.’ ” (Def.’s Mem. 
14-15 (quoting Yohe v. Nugent, 321 F.3d 35, 40 (1st 
Cir.2003)).) The court addresses each statement 
individually, applying California law to the Newsweek 
Statement regarding Plaintiff Green and Florida law to the 
November 20, 2014 and November 21, 2014 Statements 
as to one or both of Plaintiffs Traitz and Serignese. 


*9 Before delving into the state-specific analysis, the 
court considers the Supreme Court case law applicable to 
defamation cases in which the parties dispute whether a 
statement contains actionable statements of fact or 
protected statements of opinion. In Milkovich v. Lorain 
Journal Co., the Supreme Court reviewed the history of 
the tort of defamation and development of constitutional 
protections to ensure the tort does not interfere with “the 
freedom of expression guaranteed by the First 
Amendment.” 497 U.S. 1, 21, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 111 
L.Ed.2d 1 (1990). The Court reviewed existing 
constitutional requirements, including that plaintiffs must 
(a) establish the requisite level of fault on the part of a 
defendant and (b) allege a statement that can “ 
‘reasonably [be] interpreted as stating actual facts’ about 
an individual.” /d. at 20, 110 S.Ct. 2695 (quoting Hustler 
Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 50, 108 S.Ct. 876, 
99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988)). The Court considered whether to 
create an additional constitutional privilege for “anything 
that might be labeled ‘opinion.’ ” Jd. at 18, 110 S.Ct. 
2695. In declining to adopt such a privilege, the Court 
explained there is not a clear division between statements 
of opinion and fact. “If a speaker says, ‘in my opinion 
John Jones is a liar,’ [the speaker] implies a knowledge of 
facts which lead to the conclusion that Jones told an 
untruth” and, as a result, such a statement may imply a 
false assertion of fact by failing to state what it was based 
on or because any facts referenced are incorrect or 
incomplete. /d. The Supreme Court directs courts to 
determine “whether a reasonable factfinder could 
conclude that the [allegedly defamatory] statements ... 
imply an assertion [of fact]” and whether that assertion “is 
sufficiently factual to be susceptible of being proved true 
or false,’ rather than simply determine whether a 
statement expresses an opinion or asserts a fact. Jd. at 21, 
110 S.Ct. 2695. At this stage of the litigation, the court’s 


VWestlawNext 


concern is whether any fact contained in or implied by an 
allegedly defamatory statement is susceptible to being 
proved true or false; if so capable, Defendant cannot 
avoid application of defamation law by claiming the 
statement expresses only opinion. See Ferlauto v. 
Hamsher, 74 Cal.App.4th 1394, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 849 
(1999); Zambrano v. Devanesan, 484 So.2d 603, 606 
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1986). Ultimately, if Plaintiffs’ claims 
survive this initial challenge, Defendant will have the 
opportunity, at the procedurally appropriate time, to fully 
develop a defense based on the truth of the facts contained 
in or implied by each statement. 


a. The Newsweek Statement Pertaining to Plaintiff 
Green 


i. Substantially True 


M1 Gel Ui U2iDefendant argues the Newsweek 
Statement—‘“This is a 10-year-old, discredited accusation 
that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still 
nothing”’—does not contain any defamatory content 
because it is true. Even if a statement is offensive, it 
cannot be the basis for a defamation suit if it is true. Smith 
v. Maldonado, 72 Cal.App.4th 637, 85 Cal.Rptr.2d 397, 
403 (1999). While a “defendant need not justify the literal 
truth of every word,” to prevail in a defamation action, the 
defendant must “prove[ ] true the substance of the 
charge.” Jd. An “ ‘imputation is substantially true’ ” if it 
“Sustif[ies] the ‘gist or sting’ ” of the remark. Jd. (quoting 
Campanelli v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 44 Cal.App.4th 
572, 51 Cal.Rptr.2d 891, 897 (1996)). It is uncontested 
that the meaning of the first part of the statement is 
accurate—Plaintiff Green had first made her accusations 
approximately ten years earlier. As to the rest of the 
statement, Defendant argues the substance is true because 
(1) Plaintiff Green’s attorney disciplinary issues in 
California, which are not mentioned in the statement, 
were sufficient to discredit her and (2) the substance of 
the allegations was never the subject of a civil or criminal 
legal proceeding. The court does not agree. First, Plaintiff 
Green does not claim the language in the Newsweek 
Statement is defamatory because it describes her as being 
a discredited person related to her legal profession. 
Rather, she argues the statement asserts that her sexual 
assault allegation was discredited. Second, an absence of 
civil or criminal proceedings does not establish that an 
allegation was “discredited” or “proved to be nothing.” In 
the absence of legal proceedings, Plaintiff Green’s 
allegations could not have been established to lack legal 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 16 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


merit at a court hearing. The statement attributable to 
Defendant implies the allegations were somehow truly 
disproven without stating how or where, thereby failing to 
self-authenticate as a statement of true fact. A statement is 
considered false for the purposes of defamation if “it 
would have a different effect on the mind of the reader 
from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.” 
Hughes v. Hughes, 122 Cal.App.4th 931, 19 Cal.Rptr.3d 
247, 251 (2004) Gnternal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). For that reason, California courts “look to what 
is explicitly stated as well as what insinuation and 
implication can be reasonably drawn from _ the 
communication.” Forsher v. Bugliosi, 26 Cal.3d 792, 163 
Cal.Rptr. 628, 608 P.2d 716, 721 (1980). 


ii. Opinion or Fact 


(SI 041 ISH y addition to asserting the Newsweek Statement 
is not defamatory since it is substantially true, Defendant 
argues it is not defamatory because it expresses an 
opinion rather than a fact capable of being proved false. 
California courts have interpreted the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Milkovich as establishing that the First 
Amendment only prohibits defamation liability for the 
expression of an opinion where the factual basis for the 
opinion is provided, the facts provided are true, and the 
opinion does not imply false assertions of facts. GetFugu, 
Inc. v. Patton Boggs LLP, 220 Cal.App.4th 141, 162 
Cal.Rptr.3d 831, 842 (2013) (citing Milkovich, 497 U.S. 
at 18-19, 110 S.Ct. 2695 and McGarry v. Univ. of San 
Diego, 154 Cal.App.4th 97, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 467, 479 
(2007)). Accordingly, “it is not the literal truth or falsity 
of each word or detail used in a statement” which 
determines whether it is a potentially defamatory 
statement of fact; “rather, the determinative question is 
whether the ‘gist or sting’ of the statement is true or false, 
benign or defamatory, in substance.” Ringler Assocs. Inc. 
v. Md. Cas. Co., 80 Cal.App.4th 1165, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 
136, 150 (2000) (emphasis omitted) (internal quotation 
omitted); see also Campanelli, 51 Cal.Rptr.2d at 897. The 
court can, as a matter of law, find a statement is not 
actionable, but when an allegedly defamatory statement 
can reasonably be interpreted as either stating or implying 
a false fact or articulating an opinion, California courts 
put the issue before a jury. See Ferlauto, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d at 
849 (“If the court concludes the statement could 
reasonably be construed as either fact or opinion, the issue 
should be resolved by a jury.”’). In determining whether a 
statement is capable of being interpreted as asserting or 
implying a fact, California courts use the “totality of the 
circumstances test.” Jd. This test has three parts: “(1) 
whether the general tenor of the entire work negates the 


WestlawNext 


impression that the defendant was asserting an objective 
fact, (2) whether the defendant used figurative or 
hyperbolic language that negates that impression, and (3) 
whether the statement in question is susceptible of being 
proved true or false.” Lieberman v. Fieger, 338 F.3d 
1076, 1080 (9th Cir.2003) (citations omitted) (applying 
California law). 


*10 As to the first part—general tenor—Defendant points 
out the statement was made “in response to serious 
charges” and argues this “is a strong contextual signal that 
the statement is non-actionable opinion.” (Def.’s Mem. 
14.) Specifically, Defendant suggests the court should 
treat the response as a “predictable opinion,” which an 
average reader would understand as a one-sided attempt 
to bolster his position in a dispute.’ Several California 
courts have used the phrase “predictable opinion” to 
describe a statement that, due to the context in which it is 
made, is understood to be a one-sided expression of 
opinion rather than fact. However, California courts have 
only applied the principle to cases where the statements

position of the maker of the statement). 


The context in which Defendant’s agent made the 
Newsweek Statement was different from the context in 
which California courts have identified statements as 
“predictable opinions”; at the time this statement was 
made there was no pending litigation between Defendant 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 17 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


and Plaintiff Green. Some readers may have understood 
any statement from Defendant to have been predictably 
self-serving, but there was no litigation pending when a 
publicist for Defendant provided the statement to the 
media. Accordingly, the court cannot determine at this 
stage that the statement fits within the “predictable 
opinion” doctrine recognized in California. Nor can the 
court conclude that the general tenor of the statement 
negates the impression that Defendant was asserting an 
objective fact. 


Turning next to the specific language of the statement, the 
phrase—“discredited accusation that proved to be nothing 
at the time, and is still nothing’”—has an obvious literal 
meaning, specifically, that Plaintiff Green’s allegations 
are completely without merit and have been so proven. 
The operative phrases are not surrounded by hyperbole or 
figurative language that undercuts their literal meaning. 
Cf. Standing Comm. on Discipline of U.S. Dist. Court v. 
Yagman, 55 F.3d 1430, 1440 (9th Cir.1995) (applying 
California law) (treating as rhetorical hyperbole the word 
“dishonest” because it was used within a “string of 
colorful adjectives”); see also Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 
1068, 1077 (9th Cir.2005) (describing “slang phrases such 
as ‘[d]udes rollin’ deep’ and ‘[k]ickin’ it with much 
flavor’ ” as using loose and figurative language incapable 
of a “literal interpretation”). The phrasing used here 
allows a “reasonable factfinder [to] conclude the 
[statement] impl[ies] an assertion of defamatory fact,” 
specifically, that there was some _ unidentified 
investigation or hearing into the allegations which 
officially determined Plaintiff Green’s accusation was 
false. Ringler Assocs. Inc., 96 Cal.Rptr.2d at 149 
(emphasis omitted). 


Finally, the court considers whether Defendant’s 
response, directly or by implication, makes a statement 
which is susceptible of being proved true or false. To the 
extent Defendant’s response implies an investigation into 
Plaintiff Green’s allegations was conducted, it is provable 
as true or false. Additionally, the gist of the 
statement—that Plaintiff Green fabricated her 
allegations—is also provable as true or false. It may take 
a trial to produce such proof, but Defendant’s allegations 
are sufficiently specific “to be susceptible to proof or 
disproof.” James v. San Jose Mercury News, Inc., 17 
Cal.App.4th 1, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 890, 898 (1993) (finding 
statements not susceptible of being proved true or false 
because the statements contained too many 
generalizations, elastic terms, and subjective elements for 
it to be clear what facts were stated or implied); see also 
Amaretto Ranch Breedables, LLC, No. CV 10-5696 
CRB, 2013 WL 3460707, at *5 (finding a statement might 
be provable as true or false, though it would require a 


WestlawNext 


lengthy lawsuit, but determining other factors prevented 
statement from being defamatory). Based on this “totality 
of the circumstances” analysis, the court concludes a 
reasonable factfinder could determine, based on the 
context and content, the Newsweek Statement asserted or 
implied factual statements that were susceptible of being 
proved true or false. 


iii. Defamatory Meaning 


*11 "°'The court considers next whether the statement 
could be understood to have a defamatory meaning. 
Analogizing to Gibney v. Fitzgibbon, 547 Fed.Appx. 111 
(3d Cir.2013) (unpublished), Defendant argues an 
assertion by a person that an allegation is unfounded 
cannot reasonably be viewed as exposing the person who 
made the allegation to “scorn or ridicule.” The facts of 
this case are easily distinguished from those in Gibney 
and the differences require the court to reach a different 
conclusion here. 


In Gibney, the plaintiff had contacted a company that did 
business with his employer to allege his employer was 
improperly billing the company. /d. at 112. The company 
responded that the allegations had been investigated and 
determined to be unfounded. Jd. The Third Circuit held 
that the company’s response, even if untrue, was not 
capable of a defamatory meaning because a statement that 
“his allegations were unfounded” would not “ ‘lower him 
in the estimation of the community or ... deter third 
parties from associating or dealing with him.’ ” /d. at 114 
(quoting Tucker v. Phila. Daily News, 577 Pa. 598, 848 
A.2d 113, 124 (2004)). This conclusion makes sense 
where the detail of business billing procedures leaves 
open the possibility that a person making an allegation of 
wrongdoing could have made an honest mistake. In this 
respect, it is hard to even compare an allegation regarding 
billing procedures to a sexual assault allegation. A 
neutral-toned response relative to an investigation of 
billing history does not impart any flavor of fabrication or 
moral repugnance, both of which attach to Defendant’s 
statement and its suggestion that Plaintiff intentionally 
lied about being sexually assaulted. Unlike a billing 
dispute, Plaintiff Green’s allegations detail a specific set 
of events that either occurred substantially as alleged or 
were fabricated, leaving no room for an honest mistake. 


The potential for reputational damage is increased where 
the response lacks the neutral tone conveyed in Gibney by 
the word “unfounded,” which means “lacking a sound 
basis in ... fact.” Webster’s Third New International 
Dictionary 2496 (1971). Defendant referred to serious 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 18 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


sexual assault allegations as “discredited” and “nothing,” 
both words suggesting that the allegations were not made 
in good faith. Id. at 647, 1544. Given the different nature 
of the allegations in this case and the wording of the 
response, the court cannot conclude here that, as a matter 
of law, Defendant’s response is incapable of negatively 
impacting Plaintiff Green’s reputation within the 
community. Ultimately, it will be up to a jury to decide 
whether those who read the Newsweek Statement 
understood it to have been defamatory. At this stage, 
however, the court finds Defendant has not identified 
sufficient grounds for dismissal of Plaintiff Green’s 
claims based on the Newsweek Statement. 


b. The Statements Pertaining to Plaintiffs Traitz and 
Serignese 


17] 08h, Florida, as in California, “to be actionable, a 
defamatory publication must convey to a reasonable 
reader the impression that it describes actual facts about 
the plaintiff or the activities in which [s]he participated.” 
Fortson v. Colangelo, 434 F.Supp.2d 1369, 1379 
(S.D.Fla.2006). Generally, a court must decide, as a 
matter of law, whether a statement expresses a pure 
opinion or a “mixed opinion” from which unstated facts 
are likely to be inferred. Scott v. Busch, 907 So.2d 662, 
668 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005)._ However, where the 
statement could be understood in more than one way, the 
question should be submitted to the trier of fact. See Ford 
v. Rowland, 562 So.2d 731, 735 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990); 
see also Scott, 907 So.2d at 667. 


*12 'lCourts determining whether an allegedly 
defamatory statement is a protected expression of opinion 
“ “must construe the [allegedly defamatory] statement in 
its totality, examining not merely a particular phrase or 
sentence, but all of the words used in the publication.’ ” 
Keller v. Miami Herald Publ’g Co., 778 F.2d 711, 717 
(11th Cir.1985) (applying Florida Law) (quoting Hay v. 
Indep. Newspapers, Inc., 450 So.2d 293, 295 
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1984)); accord Morse v. Ripken, 707 
So.2d 921, 922 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1998). The context in 
which a statement was published and whether the 
publisher used cautionary terms must also be considered. 
Keller, 778 F.2d at 717. Defendant argues the potentially 
defamatory aspects of the November 20, 2014 Statement 
(against Traitz) and the November 21, 2014 Statement 
(against Traitz and Serignese) constitute opinions because 
they are mere “rhetorical hyperbole,” and they express a 
subjective view rather than objectively verifiable facts. 
(Def.’s Mem. 19-20, 22.) With respect to the November 
21, 2014 Statement, Defendant also argues the statement 


WestlawNext 


is not defamatory as to either Traitz or Serignese because 
the statement is not “of and concerning” either plaintiff. 
The court disagrees. 


i. November 20, 2014 Statement 


The November 20, 2014 Statement was a press release 
issued by one of Defendant’s agents for the purpose of 
further dissemination. The statement had two 
components: (1) descriptions of the allegations and (2) a 
description of Plaintiff Traitz’s later, and unrelated, 
criminal history. Plaintiff Traitz does not contest the truth 
of the second component of the statement related to her 
criminal history and does not base her defamation claim 
on this portion of the statement. Plaintiff Traitz instead 
bases her claim on the descriptions of her sexual assault 
allegations as “fabricated or unsubstantiated stories,” 
“ridiculous claims,” and, as to one __ particular 
allegation—that Defendant offered her drugs from a 
briefcase—“‘an absurd fabrication.” Defendant argues 
these words are either non-defamatory because they are 
technically accurate or rhetorical hyperbole that expresses 
opinion rather than stating fact. He asserts Plaintiff 
Traitz’s failure to publicly present any proof beyond her 
own words, combined with her criminal record, make her 
claims “unsubstantiated.”'? Defendant also argues the 
word “ridiculous” did not imply any false facts, but was 
simply rhetorical hyperbole, and the words “fabricated” 
and “fabrication” expressed opinions about the nature of 
the allegations based on her delay in coming forward and 
her criminal record. 





lThese arguments are not persuasive because the court 
is directed to consider the allegedly defamatory 
statements within the context of the entire publication. 
Smith v. Cuban Am. Nat’l Found., 731 So.2d 702, 705 
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999). Read in its entirety, one possible, 
and clearly defamatory, implication of the entire press 
release is that Plaintiff Traitz intentionally made absurdly 
false sexual assault allegations against Defendant. A jury 
must ultimately decide whether the statement asserted or 
implied this actual fact or merely opined that the 
allegations sounded far-fetched, without actually asserting 
or implying the allegations were false. See Ford, 562 
So.2d at 735 (reversing the dismissal of a libel claim 
because whether statements described actual facts or were 
merely absurd parodies depended on factual 
determinations to be made by jury). When making this 
determination, a jury can consider that the statement was 
made by Defendant’s attorney. Perhaps, as Defendant 
argues, a jury will conclude the denigration of Plaintiff 
Traitz was a “one-sided” account expressing an opinion 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 19 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


and providing the basis for that opinion, and therefore is 
not defamatory. However, at this stage it appears that a 
jury could conclude that the source of the statement—a 
person close to the subject of the allegations—made the 
statement in order to communicate the fact that Plaintiff 
Traitz’s allegations were lies. Since the November 20, 
2014 Statement can reasonably be understood as 
describing the actual fact that Plaintiff's allegations were 
false and since, at this stage, the court must accept 
Plaintiff Traitz’s allegations as true, the court concludes 
Plaintiff Traitz has adequately pled her defamation claim 
related to the November 20, 2014 Statement. Defendant’s 
request to dismiss the claim based on the November 20, 
2014 Statement is denied. 


ii. November 21, 2014 Statement 


*13 Defendant argues the November 21, 2014 Statement 
cannot be the basis of a defamation claim because (1) it 
expresses opinions rather than stating facts, (2) any 
factual statements are not defamatory, or (3) any 
defamatory facts are not defamatory as to Plaintiffs Traitz 
and Serignese because this statement is not sufficiently 
“of and concerning” them. The November 21, 2014 
Statement is the longest of the four statements attributed 
to Defendant in this suit and criticizes his accusers and the 
media for their various roles in the recent dissemination 
of the sexual assault allegations made against Defendant. 
Neither Plaintiff Traitz nor Plaintiff Serignese is 
identified by name within the statement, but it begins by 
identifying itself as a response to the “new, 
never-before-heard claims from women” who made 
allegations “in the past two weeks.” Plaintiff Traitz made 
her allegations public on November 18, 2014, and 
Plaintiff Serignese made her allegations public on 
November 19, 2014; this timing sequence clearly 
indicates the statement refers to them. 


211 (21 [3ly Florida, expressions of opinions are 
non-actionable “if the speaker states the facts on which he 
bases his opinion,” and those facts are not “false or 
inaccurately presented.” Lipsig v. Ramlawi, 760 So.2d 
170, 184 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000). A statement is also a 
“pure opinion, as a matter of law, when it is based on 
facts which are otherwise known or available to the reader 
or listener.” Razner v. Wellington Reg’! Med. Ctr., Inc., 
837 So.2d 437, 442 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002). In 
determining whether any portions of the statement are 
defamatory, the court must consider the statement “in the 
context of the publication, including the audience, the 
means by which it was delivered, and other circumstances 
surrounding the statement.” Ranbaxy Labs. Inc. v. First 


WestlawNext 


Databank, Inc., No. 3:13—CV-—859-J-32MCR, 2015 WL 
3618429, at *3 (M.D.Fla. June 9, 2015). 


Defendant’s attorney provided the November 21, 2014 
Statement to the media with the intent that the statement 
be disseminated to the public. The statement begins by 
describing the allegations that had been made against 
Defendant during the previous two weeks as “new, 
never-before-heard claims” that are “unsubstantiated, 
fantastical stories” about events occurring “30, 40, or 
even 50 years ago.” The allegations are characterized as 
having “escalated past the point of absurdity” and 
“becom[e] increasingly ridiculous.” Next, the statement 
describes as “completely illogical” the silence, over many 
years, of the accusers. Implicit in this portion of the 
statement is the suggestion that the cause of the accusers’ 
decades of silence was that they did not really believe 
they had been assaulted. The statement continues with 
two sentences about the opportunities the accusers had to 
sue Defendant and suggests “it makes no sense” that none 
of the accusers had brought legal action closer in time to 
the alleged sexual assaults. Defendant next shifts the 
focus from the accusers to the media, critiquing the speed 
with which allegations were reported and suggesting that 
the reporting violated journalistic standards because the 
stories were run without corroboration. Finally, the 
statement characterizes the media’s reporting on the 
allegations as a “vilification” of Defendant. 


P4lThe truth of portions of the statement, such as the 
length of time between when the incidents allegedly 
occurred and the date on which any particular allegation 
became public, is uncontested. Defendant argues these 
statements provide readers with the truthful facts on 
which he based his opinion that the allegations were 
unsubstantiated. This analysis is flawed because when 
read in its entirety, the statement is capable of being 
understood as asserting not just that the allegations made 
during the previous two weeks were unsubstantiated, but 
also as implying they were false and entirely without 
merit. The court cannot predict whether a jury will 
actually conclude the statement implied that fact and, if 
so, whether the assertion of fact was false, but there is a 
sufficient factual question as to the meaning readers 
would have given to the statement to preclude dismissal at 
this stage. 


*14 Defendant maintains that, regardless of the analysis 
on whether there was a false statement of fact, the 
November 21, 2014 Statement was simply not 
defamatory. A statement is capable of a defamatory effect 
if it “naturally and proximately results in injury to 
another.” Cuban Am. Nat’! Found., 731 So.2d at 705. As 
previously discussed, to falsely accuse another of sexual 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 20 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


assault is morally repugnant; the natural result of the 
publication of a statement directly or indirectly indicating 
Plaintiffs made such false accusations is injury to their 
reputations. 


Finally, the court turns to Defendant’s argument that, 
even if the November 21, 2014 Statement contains 
defamatory statements, they were not “of and concerning” 
Plaintiffs Traitz and Serignese. As a matter of substantive 
law “a cause of action for group libel cannot be 
maintained unless it is shown that the libelous statements 
are ‘of and concerning’ the plaintiff’ Thomas v. 
Jacksonville TV, Inc., 699 So.2d 800, 805 
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997). A statement can be “of and 
concerning” members of a group, provided the group 
includes fewer than twenty-five individuals and the 
statement identifies and describes each plaintiff. Cf. id. 


The November 21, 2014 Statement was released three 
days after Plaintiff Traitz made her public accusation and 
two days after Plaintiff Serignese made hers. Nothing in 
the statement indicates an intention to exclude any recent 
accusers from its sweep, and Plaintiffs assert there were 
eleven women who publicly made accusations against 
Defendant during the two weeks prior to the publication 
of the November 21, 2014 Statement. (Pls.” Mem., Ex. 2 
at { 2.) Taken together, these factors lead the court to the 
objectively reasonable inference that a factfinder could 
conclude the statement was “of and concerning” Traitz 
and Serignese. See Jacksonville TV, Inc., 699 So.2d at 
805; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 617 cmt. a 
(explaining that the question of whether the statement was 
“of and concerning the plaintiff” is “ordinarily for the jury 
or trier of fact to determine’). 


2. Requisite Degree of Fault 


5lThe Supreme Court requires the respective defamation 
law of each state to include an element of fault. See Gertz 
v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 347-48, 94 S.Ct. 
2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). Recognizing the tension 
between providing protections for individuals’ reputations 
and encouraging an open and free press, the Supreme 
Court requires a plaintiff to demonstrate a higher level of 
fault when the allegedly defamatory statement concerns a 
public figure, rather than when it concerns a private 
individual outside the public sphere. /d. at 342-46, 94 
S.Ct. 2997.  Private-figure plaintiffs need only 
demonstrate a defendant (or defendant’s agent acting 
within the scope of the agency) acted negligently. See 
Mile Marker, Inc. v. Petersen Publ’g, LLC, 811 So.2d 
841, 845 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002); Sarver v. Hurt Locker 


WestlawNext 


LLC, No.  2:10—cv—09034-JHN-JCx, 2011 WL 
11574477, at *8 n. 11 (C.D.Cal. Oct. 13, 2011). By 
contrast, if a plaintiff is a public figure, then such plaintiff 
must show the defendant (or defendant’s agent acting 
within the scope of the agency) acted with actual malice 
in uttering the defamatory remark. See Nguyen—Lam v. 
Cao, 171 Cal.App.4th 858, 90 Cal.Rptr.3d 205, 212 
(2009); Miami Herald Publ’g Co. v. Ane, 423 So.2d 376, 
382 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1982). Malice exists, generally, if a 
defendant or a defendant’s agent makes the statement 
knowing it is false or with reckless disregard to its truth. 
See Nguyen—Lam, 90 Cal.Rptr.3d at 212; Ane, 423 So.2d 
at 378, 382. 


*15 The parties have not raised the issue of Plaintiffs’ 
public or private status for this litigation, and Defendant 
argues a failure to plead sufficient facts to establish either 
level of fault. Accordingly, the court considers Plaintiffs 
to be private individuals at this stage of the litigation. See 
Pan Am Sys., Inc. v. Hardenbergh, 871 F.Supp.2d 6, 16 
(D.Me.2012) (employing this approach in similar 
situation). Therefore, under both California and Florida 
law, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the requisite degree 
of fault if they allege facts demonstrating Defendant (or 
his agents acting within the scope of their agency) acted 
negligently. See Brown v. Kelly Broad. Co., 48 Cal.3d 
711, 257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406, 425 (1989); Boyles 
v. Mid-Florida TV Corp., 431 So.2d 627, 634 
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983), aff'd 467 So.2d 282, 283 
(Fla.1985). Negligence exists if the statement is made 
without first exercising reasonable care to determine if it 
is, in fact, false. Hecimovich v. Encinal Sch. Parent 
Teacher Org., 203 Cal.App.4th 450, 137 Cal.Rptr.3d 455, 
471 (2012); Boyles, 431 So.2d at 634. Individuals not 
only clearly fail to exercise reasonable care if they make a 
statement known to be false, but also if a reasonable 
person would have known the statement was false. See 
Brown, 257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d at 430; Boyles, 431 
So.2d at 634; Carney v. Santa Cruz Women Against Rape, 
221 Cal.App.3d 1009, 271 Cal.Rptr. 30, 34 n. 2 (1990). 


The two legal theories for establishing fault in this case 
are: respondeat superior liability and direct liability. 
Respondeat superior is a “doctrine holding an employer 
or principal liable for the employee’s or agent’s wrongful 
acts committed within the scope of the employment or 
agency.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1505 (10th ed. 2014). 
Under the direct liability theory, Defendant would be held 
liable on the basis of his own fault for his conduct and 
involvement regarding the statements. 


a. Respondeat Superior Liability 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 21 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


6lDefendant asserts the SAC does not sufficiently allege 
his agents possessed the requisite degree of fault 
necessary to hold Defendant liable for defamation on the 
basis of respondeat superior.’° When a third party is 
harmed by an agent’s conduct, the principal is subject to 
respondeat superior liability, a form of vicarious liability, 
if the agent was acting within the scope of work 
performed for the principal and the principal controlled or 
had a right to control the manner of the agent’s work. 
Restatement (Third) of Agency §§ 7.03, 7.07 (2006); see 
also Rivera v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 331 F.3d 1074, 
1080 (9th Cir.2003) (“[U]nder California law [an 
employer] may be held liable for defamatory statements 
made by its employees under the doctrine of respondeat 
superior ... if the defamation occurred within the scope of 
the employee’s employment.”); Mercury Motors Express, 
Inc. vy. Smith, 393 So.2d 545, 549 (Fla.1981) (“An 
employer is vicariously liable ... [for] the negligent acts of 
employees committed within the scope of _ their 
employment even if the employer is without fault.”). It 
follows that, under this theory, “a principal’s vicarious 
liability turns on whether the agent is liable.” Restatement 
(Third) of Agency § 7.03 cmt. b; see id. (“In most cases, 
direct liability requires fault on the part of the principal 
whereas vicarious liability does not require that the 
principal be at fault.”); accord Estate of Miller v. Thrifty 
Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., 637 F.Supp.2d 1029, 1037 
(M.D.Fla.2009); Palomares v. Bear Stearns Residential 
Mortg. Corp., No. 07cv01899 WQH (BLM), 2008 WL 
686683, at *4 (S.D.Cal. Mar. 13, 2008). In order to 
proceed on their theory of respondeat superior liability, 
Plaintiffs’ SAC must include sufficient allegations 
supporting a finding of fault on the part of those speaking 
for Defendant—Phillips, Brokaw, and Singer. As 
discussed above, both California and Florida use a 
negligence standard when evaluating whether a defendant 
has published a defamatory statement about a private 
individual. See Mile Marker, Inc., 811 So.2d at 845; 
Sarver, 2011 WL 11574477, at *8 n. 11. This standard 
applies equally to authorized agents acting in the scope of 
their agency. See Estate of Miller, 637 F.Supp.2d at 1037; 
Palomares, 2008 WL 686683, at *4. 


*16 Defendant contends Plaintiffs’ allegations are 
threadbare or conclusory and cannot be the basis of a 
“plausible determination” that Defendant’s agents acted 
with fault. (Def.’s Mem. 31-32.) This argument cannot 
succeed if, after accepting Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, 
the court can reasonably infer that those speaking for 
Defendant—Phillips, Brokaw, and  Singer—were 
themselves negligent. The SAC states directly and by 
inference that the individuals who issued the statements 
were professionals, employed by Defendant for purposes 
including speaking to the media on his behalf. (SAC {J 


WestlawNext 


25-26, 29-30, 33-35, 37, 51-53, 55, 65-68, 70, 77, 88, 99.) 
Given Defendant’s prominence in the entertainment field, 
the court infers he surrounded himself with people 
accomplished in media relations and legal matters. The 
court also infers those making Defendant’s public 
statements had an open line of communication with him 
as well as some historical perspective on his public 
relations matters. Based on the facts and inferences, the 
court finds it plausible at this point to conclude (1) those 
agents would have had, at a minimum, some sense of 
Defendant’s alleged conduct, such that their duty of care 
would have required them to take steps to determine the 
truth or falsity of the statements, and (2) the content of 
their responsive statements demonstrates such reasonable 
care was not taken. 


In reaching its conclusions, the court notes that prior to 
the formal discovery process, facts pertaining to state of 
mind in defamation actions need not be alleged with 
extreme detail, due to the difficulty of definitively 
ascertaining them at this stage of litigation. See Schatz v. 
Republican State Leadership Comm., 669 F.3d 50, 58 (1st 
Cir.2012) Gn the defamation context, state of mind may 
be alleged generally); see also generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 
9(b); Grajales v. P.R. Ports Auth., 682 F.3d 40, 49 (1st 
Cir.2012). 


The court, at this stage, accepting all of Plaintiffs’ 
well-pled averments as true, finds respondeat superior 
liability is sufficiently pled. Therefore, Defendant’s 
motion for dismissal on this point is denied. 


b. Direct Liability 


8lDefendant asserts that Plaintiffs do not identify direct 
liability as a legal theory upon which the defamation 
claims can be proven. However, the SAC does state 
Defendant acted “by and through” each of the people who 
actually gave each statement alleged to be defamatory. 
(SAC QJ 25, 30, 33-35, 38, 51-52, 56, 65-68, 71, 73-74, 
77, 80-82, 85, 88, 91-93, 96, 99, 102-04.) The SAC also 
states that Defendant’s agents gave the statements “‘at the 
direction of Defendant.” (/d. {| 37, 55, 70.) Additionally, 
the SAC states Defendant knew the claimed defamatory 
statements were false at the time they were published. (/d. 
GW 36, 54, 69, 79, 90, 101.) If a principal purposefully 
directs an agent to perform an action, and that agent 
performs the action, then the principal is directly 
responsible for the consequences of the action. See 
Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.03; see also HBSC Ins. 
Ltd. v.  Scanwell Container Line Ltd., No. CV 
00-05729SVW(SHX), 2001 WL 940673, at *2 (C.D.Cal. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 22 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


Jan. 17, 2001); Partington v. Metallic Eng’g Co., 792 
So.2d 498, 501 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2001). 


lThe court is not persuaded by Defendant’s argument 
that Plaintiffs did not adequately plead direct liability as a 
named legal theory. Under the applicable federal 
procedural requirements, a complaint need only put a 
defendant on notice as to legal theories and this can be 
done, as here, without formally naming them; a plaintiff 
need not perfectly plead all legal theories. See Johnson v. 
City of Shelby, — U.S. -——, 135 S.Ct. 346, 190 L.Ed.2d 
309 (2014) (reversing dismissal because “[f]ederal 
pleading rules ... do not countenance dismissal of a 
complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory 
supporting the claim asserted”); see also id. at 347 (“ ‘The 
federal rules effectively abolish the restrictive theory of 
the pleadings doctrine, making it clear that it is 
unnecessary to set out a legal theory for the plaintiff’s 
claim for relief.’ ” (quoting 5 Charles Alan Wright & 
Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1219, 
at 277-78 (3d ed. 2002))). 


Defendant rightfully concedes that if he had “approved 
defamatory statements before they were issued, he would 
be directly liable for defamation, irrespective of whether 
he or his agents personally issued the statements.” (Dkt. 
No. 41, Def.’s Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss 10 
(“Def.’s Reply Mem.”).) See Overstock.com, Inc. v. 
Gradient Analytics, Inc., 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 61 
Cal.Rptr.3d 29, 48 (2007); Island City Flying Serv. v. 
Gen. Elec. Credit Corp., 585 So.2d 274, 278 (Fla.1991). 
But he asserts in his reply brief there was a failure to 
plead sufficient facts to infer actual approval. (Def.’s 
Reply Mem. at 10.) The court does not agree. From 
examination of all the facts in the SAC, it does not take a 
speculative leap for the court to conclude Defendant 
would be personally involved in reviewing these types of 
accusations against him, crafting or approving the 
responsive statements, and directing the dissemination. 
The SAC alleges Defendant was an “internationally 
known” entertainment figure and the people making 
public statements for him were acting either as attorney or 
publicist and/or authorized representative or employee. 
(SAC J 3, 26, 29, 53.) At this stage of the litigation, it 
would be unreasonable to view these particular 
circumstances, responding to very serious accusations of 
the nature involved here, as not having the direct 
involvement of Defendant. 


*17 The court therefore finds direct liability is sufficiently 


pled. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for dismissal on 
this point is denied. 


WestlawNext 


3. Self-Defense Privilege 


The court turns to Defendant’s argument that Plaintiffs’ 
claims should be dismissed even if the statements at issue 
are potentially defamatory because these statements are 
protected by the common-law privilege of self-defense. 
(Def.’s Mem. 22-25.) Defendant relies in part on a 
Massachusetts case, contending “[t]he privilege of 
self-defense includes the right to ‘brand the accusations as 
false and calumnious’ and to ‘comment upon the motives 
of the accuser.’ ” (Ud. at 23 (quoting Conroy v. Fall River 
Herald News Co., 306 Mass. 488, 28 N.E.2d 729, 730 
(1940)).) Defendant also asserts, without citing any 
authority, “[t]here is no requirement that, to avail oneself 
of the self-defense privilege, the responsive statement be 
truthful.” (/d. at 25.) The court concludes the state 
substantive law governing Plaintiffs’ claims does not 
recognize this privilege and, even if it were recognized, 
the court at this stage could not find that it applies. 

(301 BUNeither California nor Florida recognize the 
self-defense privilege. As the parties acknowledge, 
California courts have rejected the notion of a privilege to 
defame in self-defense. (Pls.’ Mem. 11; Def.’s Mem. 23 
n.8.) See Finke v. Walt Disney Co., 110 Cal.App.4th 
1210, 2 Cal.Rptr.3d 436, 459 (2003) (“California does not 
recognize ‘self-help’ as an independent privilege.”), 
review granted, 6 Cal.Rptr.3d 424, 79 P.3d 541 (2003), 
review dismissed as settled, 19 Cal.Rptr.3d 828,99 P.3d 5 
(2004)."” Similarly, while Florida recognizes several types 
of conditional defensive privileges in the context of 
defamation, self-defense is not one of them. See Nodar v. 
Galbreath, 462 So.2d 803, 809-10 (Fla.1984) 
(recognizing the privileges of mutuality of interest 
between the speaker and the listener, protection of the 
recipient’s interest, and statements to a political authority 
regarding issues of public concern). Moreover, the court 
is not persuaded by Defendant’s assertion that, because 
Florida courts have never explicitly rejected the 
self-defense privilege, it must be assumed the privilege 
would be recognized in Florida. In the court’s view, the 
absence of any indication that Florida courts would adopt 
this privilege, especially when they have explicitly 
adopted other common-law defamation privileges, 
establishes no basis to assume the self-defense privilege 
would be recognized in Florida. Cf. Klayman v. City 
Pages, No. 5:13-—cv—143—Oc—22PRL, 2015 WL 1546173, 
at *17 n. 18 (M.D.Fla. Apr. 3, 2015) (declining to find 
that the “libel-proof plaintiff’ defamation defense exists 
in Florida when the defendants failed to provide any 
authority in support of that assertion). 


'2IThe court recognizes that some jurisdictions do apply a 
version of the conditional self-defense privilege, which 
allows individuals, in certain circumstances, to publish 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 23 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


defamatory responsive statements necessary to defend 
their reputation. However, as recognized by the cases 
Defendant himself cites, as well as the Restatement, such 
a privilege does not permit a defendant to knowingly 
publish false statements of fact. See Conroy, 28 N.E.2d at 
730 (‘{O]ne has a right in good faith to brand the 
accusations as false and calumnious.” (emphasis added)); 
Shepherd v. Baer, 96 Md. 152, 53 A. 790, 791 (1902) 
(explaining that an individual relying on the self-defense 
privilege “cannot avail himself of the occasion to make 
false charges of fact’); Restatement (Second) of Torts § 
593 (conditional privilege may not be “abused”); id. § 600 
(conditional privilege is abused if publisher “(a) knows 
the matter to be false, or (b) acts in reckless disregard as 
to its truth or falsity”). As explained in a treatise relied 
upon by both Plaintiffs and Defendant, the self-defense 
privilege permits the speaker to “call the accuser a liar, 
but she or he may not include in the reply defamatory 
matter that is irrelevant or that the speaker knows or 
believes to be false. To do so is to abuse, and therefore 
lose, the privilege.” Sack on Defamation § 9:2.1, at 9-11 
(4th ed. 2010) (emphasis added). 


*18 Accordingly, even in jurisdictions recognizing this 
conditional privilege, there is a clash with the applicable 
motion to dismiss standard. At the motion to dismiss 
stage, Plaintiffs’ allegations are presumed true, San 
Gerénimo Caribe Project, Inc. 687 F.3d at 471, so 
Defendant’s allegedly defamatory self-defense responses, 
made through his agents, would necessarily be viewed as 
knowingly false under these specific circumstances. This 
alone would negate the good faith requirement regarding 
the self-defense privilege at the motion to dismiss stage." 
See Lundquist v. Reusser, 7 Cal.4th 1193, 31 Cal.Rptr.2d 
776, 875 P.2d 1279, 1291 (1994) (conditional privileges 
which California does recognize are lost “if the person 
making the statement was ... [m]otivated by hatred or 
ill-will toward the plaintiff which induced the publication; 
or ... [w]as without a good-faith belief in the truth of the 
statement”); Thomas v. Tampa Bay Downs, Inc., 761 
So.2d 401, 404 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000) (explaining that an 
essential element for conditional privileges which Florida 
does recognize is “good faith’); see also Bank of Am. 
Corp.  v. Valladares, 141 So3d 714, 718 
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2014) (conditional privilege to report a 
crime is lost “if the reporter acts maliciously, meaning the 
reporter either knows the report is false or recklessly 
disregards whether the report is false”), review granted, 
168 So.3d 231 (Fla.2015). The court would thus be 
constrained to infer that Defendant abused, and therefore 
lost, the privilege. See Sack on Defamation § 9:1, at 9-2 
(“In some situations, a speaker will not be held liable for 
false defamatory statements because the freedom to speak 
in protection of certain interests is deemed to be more 


WestlawNext 


important than the ability to redress harm to reputation 
that such speech may cause. But for the speaker to be 
protected in such situations, the statement must be made 
in good faith and for proper motives and the occasion 
must not be otherwise ‘abused.’ ”); see also id. §§ 
9:3.1-9:3.2, at 9-41 to 9-50 (discussing the different types 
of “malice” which courts find to be an abuse of 
conditional privileges). Therefore, even if Florida and 
California did recognize this privilege, Defendant would 
not be able to invoke it at this stage to support his motion 
to dismiss. 


4. Incremental Harm as to November 20, 2014 
Statement about Plaintiff Traitz 


Defendant argues the defamation claim by Plaintiff Traitz 
that stems from the November 20, 2014 Statement should 
be dismissed because she has not suffered incremental 
harm as a result of the statement. According to Defendant, 
the allegedly defamatory portion of Singer’s statement is 
no more damaging to Traitz’s reputation than the true 
reporting of her criminal convictions. 

(341 B51 B6lPhe “incremental harm doctrine,” which some 
courts have described as related to the “libel-proof 
plaintiff doctrine,” see Thomas v. Tel. Publ’g Co., 929 
A.2d 993, 1002 (N.H.2007); Stern v. Cosby, 645 
F.Supp.2d 258, 270 (S.D.N.Y.2009), “measures the harm 
‘inflicted by the challenged statements beyond the harm 
imposed by the rest of the publication. If that harm is 
determined to be nominal or nonexistent, the statements 
are dismissed as not actionable.’ ” Masson v. New Yorker 
Magazine, Inc., 960 F.2d 896, 898 (9th Cir.1992) (quoting 
Herbert v. Lando, 781 F.2d 298, 311 (2d Cir.1986)); see 
also Tel. Publ’g Co., 929 A.2d at 1002-03.” 


*19 ©"lDefendant has not provided any authority, and the 
court has not found any, indicating that Florida (the 
jurisdiction controlling resolution of Plaintiff Traitz’s 
claims) recognizes this defense. Accordingly, just as the 
court in Klayman, 2015 WL 1546173, at *17 n. 18, 
refused to recognize the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine 
under Florida law, this court, in the absence of any 
indication to the contrary, cannot conclude the Florida 
Supreme Court would adopt the incremental harm 
doctrine. Cf. Masson, 960 F.2d at 899 (concluding that 
“the incremental harm doctrine is not an element of 
California libel law,” in part, “because the California 
courts have never adopted it”); Noonan v. Staples, Inc., 
707 F.Supp.2d 85, 90 (D.Mass.2010) (“Since no court in 
the Commonwealth has ever recognized the doctrine of 
incremental harm, this Court refrains from doing so 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 24 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


here.”). Even if Florida did recognize this doctrine, the 
court would not conclude, especially at this stage of the 
litigation, that the challenged portion of Singer’s 
statement—asserting that Plaintiff Traitz fabricated the 
sexual assault allegation—caused no more than nominal 
harm beyond the reporting of her criminal convictions. 
See, e.g., Church of Scientology Int’l v. Time Warner, 
Inc., 932 F.Supp. 589, 594 (S.D.N.Y.1996) ( “[T]he 
doctrine requires a court to measure the harm flowing 
from the challenged statement as compared to the harm 
flowing from the rest of the publication ... and the parties 
have not yet conducted discovery on the issue of 


VI. CONCLUSION

Footnotes 


1 


When the court granted leave for Plaintiffs to file the SAC, the court simultaneously afforded Defendant the opportunity 
to “file a motion to dismiss which responds to the newly amended complaint, or which supplements the [motions to 
dismiss] previously filed.” (Dkt. No. 46.) Defendant notified the court of his continued reliance on previously-filed 
submissions. (Dkt No. 62, Def. Letter/request (non-motion).) Accordingly, the court evaluates Defendant’s 
previously-filed motions to dismiss, and arguments in support thereof, in relation to Plaintiffs’ SAC. 


The court’s factual summary includes an abbreviated version of those facts alleged by Plaintiffs. The court also makes 
use of the full text versions of the allegedly defamatory statements. For three of those statements, the court utilizes full 
text versions provided by Defendant as exhibits to his memorandum in support of his motions. (Dkt. No. 25, Decl. re: 
Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss, Exs. A, D, F.) Plaintiffs have not contested the accuracy of the full versions of these 
statements provided by Defendant and the court considers them as “documents sufficiently referred to in the 
complaint” and as “central to plaintiffs’ claims.” See Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993); see also Fudge v. 
Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 840 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir.1988) (affirming District Court’s decision, under similar 
circumstances, to consider a copy of the article submitted by the defendant which had formed the basis of the 
defamation action, as it was central to the plaintiff's complaint). Additionally, the court uses the full text version of a 
fourth statement provided by Plaintiffs as an exhibit to their motion for leave to file their SAC. (Dkt. No. 20, Pls.’ Mem. 
Supp. re: Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl., Ex. C.) 


While Plaintiff Serignese is not specific as to how or where this allegation was disclosed (see SAC § 50), Defendant 
states that it was disclosed to the Huffington Post. (Dkt. No. 24, Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mots. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Mem.”) 5 
(citing SAC § 48).) Defendant has attached a document which he asserts to be the Huffington Post article in question. 
(Decl. re: Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. C.) Plaintiff Serignese has not offered a conflicting explanation. 


In the SAC, Plaintiffs describe two of the individuals who issued the statements as doing so while an “agent, authorized 
representative, lawyer, servant, and/or employee” of Defendant and one as doing so while an “agent, authorized 
representative, servant, and/or employee” of Defendant. (SAC {J 26, 29, 53.) As any distinctions among the meanings 
of these terms are not material at this stage, throughout this opinion the court refers to these individuals as Defendant’s 
“agents.” 


The court will refer to these responsive statements, collectively, as the “Washington Post Statement.” 


The parties have not provided the court with a copy of the original, uncorrected version of the November 22, 2014 
Washington Post Online Article. 


Defendant, in turn, has also provided the court with a copy of the correction notice issued with respect to the print 
edition and dated December 12, 2014. (Dkt. No. 28, Decl. re: Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl., 
Ex. 1.) It reads in its entirety: “1A Nov. 23 Page One article about the allegations of sexual assault against Bill Cosby 
misstated the timing of a statement of denial issued by an attorney for Cosby. The statement denying Tamara Green’s 
allegations was issued by lawyer Walter M. Phillips Jr. when Green’s allegations first surfaced in 2005, not in the week 
before the article was published.” (/d. at 2.)

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 26-1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 25 of 26 


Green v. Cosby, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2015) 


19 


As mentioned, the correction notice issued with respect to the November 23, 2014 Washington Post Print Article, 
provided by Defendant, is worded slightly differently than the correction notice for the November 22, 2014 Washington 
Post Online Article used by Plaintiff. (See Dkt. 28, Decl. re: Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl., Ex. 
1; Mem. re: Mot. to Am., Ex. C) The court generally limits its discussion to the correction with respect to the online 
article, as that correction is treated as an attachment to the complaint, but recognizes both corrections make the same 
operative point. 


Plaintiffs also argue the court may not take judicial notice of the correction because Defendant is attempting to use it to 
prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, i.e., that Phillips in fact provided his statement in 2005, not in 2014. See, 
e.g., Kosilek v. Spencer, 889 F.Supp.2d 190, 215 n. 6 (D.Mass.2012), affd, 740 F.3d 733 (1st Cir.2014), revd en banc 
on other grounds, 774 F.3d 63 (1st Cir.2014). The court is not taking judicial notice of the correction pursuant to Rule 
201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence because Plaintiffs used it to support their motion to amend and relied on it in their 
SAC, effectively attaching it to their complaint. Accordingly, this limitation (documents judicially noticed under Rule 201 
may not be considered for the truth of the matter asserted) is a non-issue. See, e.g., Papadopoulos v. Amaker, No. 
12-CV-3608 (DLI)(RLM), 2013 WL 3226757, at *1 n. 1 (E.D.N.Y. June 25, 2013). 


The court notes that, if it were to consider both the online and print versions of the correction notices, the slightly 
different wording between the two, which may well be innocuous, could arguably raise questions about the manner in 
which the Washington Post came to include the Phillips statement in the article, further demonstrating the benefit in 
allowing the parties to engage the discovery process to seek clarification of these factual issues; the need for fact 
clarification is not a basis for dismissal at this stage. 


California has adopted the Uniform Single Publication Act, codifying the single publication rule at Cal. Civ. Code § 
3425.3. That section provides: 
No person shall have more than one cause of action for damages for libel or slander or invasion of privacy or any 
other tort founded upon any single publication or exhibition or utterance, such as any one issue of a newspaper or 
book or magazine or any one presentation to an audience or any one broadcast over radio or television or any one 
exhibition of a motion picture. Recovery in any action shall include all damages for any such tort suffered by the 
plaintiff in all jurisdictions. 


Relevant differences which may exist between California and Florida law regarding defamation are addressed as 
applicable throughout this Discussion. 


Defendant makes this argument as to the Newsweek Statement, the November 20, 2014 Statement, and the 
November 21, 2014 Statement, but not as to the Washington Post Statement. 


Defendant suggests California’s treatment of “predictable opinion” is similar to a “self-defense privilege.” One obvious 
difference is that the phrase “predictable opinion” is used to describe a type of statement that is not defamatory 
because it does not assert a fact capable of being proved true or false, while a self-defense privilege, in the defamation 
context, generally prevents what may be a defamatory statement from being the basis for a defamation suit because of 
a specific exception under state law. 


Defendant’s contention that Plaintiff Traitz has offered no corroboration is, at least arguably, factually inaccurate 
because of the multiplicity of similar claims, a fact acknowledged in Defendant’s statements of November 20th and 
21st. The similar claims could be considered by a fact finder as a form of corroboration by a recognizably unique 
pattern of conduct. 


In the SAC, Plaintiffs specifically allege Defendant is liable for the statements given by his agents on the basis of 
respondeat superior. (SAC [§ 83, 94, 105.) 


Defendant nonetheless asserts statements made in self-defense fall within the “predictable opinion” doctrine 
recognized in California. This court, however, has already rejected Defendant’s predictable opinion arguments. See 
Section V.C.1.a.ii., supra. Accordingly, his predictable opinion arguments fare no better here when linked to a 
purported self-defense privilege. 


Arguably, a self-defense privilege could protect a defendant who made a responsive good faith statement that later 
turned out to be inaccurate. See Sack on Defamation § 9:1, at 9-3 & n.6. 


The court notes that in some states, a defendant’s negligence in ascertaining the truth of a conditionally privileged 
defamatory statement may constitute grounds for losing the privilege. See Sack on Defamation § 9:3.4, at 9-52 to 9-53.

Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Gertz, 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, however, each state’s 
defamation law must include an element of fault at least rising to negligence; therefore, “[e]stablishing the cause of 
action would, ipso facto, establish defeasance of qualified privilege.” Sack on Defamation § 9:3.4, at 9-53. In any event, 
the court need not delve further into the complications surrounding a self-defense privilege, the ways in which it may be 
lost, and the tensions with the motion to dismiss standard, because neither California nor Florida recognizes the 
self-defense privilege. 


The libel-proof plaintiff doctrine, in contrast, looks to a plaintiff's previously damaged reputation. See Tel. Publ’g Co., 
929 A.2d at 1002-04 (explaining the differences between the incremental harm and libel-proof plaintiff doctrines). 
Under that doctrine, “when a plaintiff's reputation is so diminished at the time of publication of the allegedly defamatory 
material that only nominal damages at most could be awarded because the person’s reputation was not capable of 
sustaining further harm, the plaintiff is deemed to be libel-proof as a matter of law and is not permitted to burden a 
defendant with a trial.” Lamb v. Rizzo, 391 F.3d 1133, 1137 (10th Cir.2004) (internal citation omitted); see Tel. Publg 
Co., 929 A.2d at 1005 (“To justify applying the doctrine, the evidence of record must show not only that the plaintiff 
engaged in criminal or anti-social behavior in the past, but also that his activities were widely reported to the public.” 
(internal citation omitted)). As Plaintiffs note, Defendant has only expressly requested dismissal pursuant to the 
incremental harm doctrine, and not the separate libel-proof plaintiff doctrine. However, even if Defendant were pressing 
both grounds for dismissal, his argument would fail because Florida has not adopted the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine, 
see Klayman, 2015 WL 1546173, at *17 n. 18, and Defendant has not established that Traitz falls into the narrow 
category of individuals with a sufficiently tarnished reputation such that a defamatory statement could not impair her 
reputation, see Guccione v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 800 F.2d 298, 303 (2d Cir.1986) (“The libel-proof plaintiff doctrine 
is to be applied with caution ... since few plaintiffs will have so bad a reputation that they are not entitled to obtain 
redress for defamatory statements.” (citation omitted)); Church of Scientology Int! v. Time Warner, Inc., 932 F.Supp.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 28 Filed 01/20/16 Page 2 of 8 


Sweet, D.J. 


Defendant has moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(c) for a stay of discovery pending decision on 
Defendant’s motion to dismiss. In the alternative, Defendant has 
moved for additional time to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery 
request. Based upon the foregoing conclusions and as set forth 
below, the motion to stay is denied, and the motion to extend is 


granted. 


Prior Proceedings 


Plaintiff filed a complaint in this Court on September 21, 
2015, alleging a single defamation claim. See Compl. Defendant 
sought an extension of her time to answer, move, or otherwise 
respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint to November 30, 2015. The 
request was granted on October 12, 2015. By Order filed October 
30, 2015, the parties were directed to complete fact discovery 


by July 1, 2016, and expert discovery by August 3, 2016. 


On December 1, 2015, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss 
and the instant motion to stay discovery pending a decision on 
the motion to dismiss. Oral argument was held on both motions 


and the matters deemed fully submitted on January 14, 2016. 


; Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 28 Filed 01/20/16 Page 3 of 8 


Applicable Standard 


Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c), the 
Court has broad discretion to issue a protective order on 
Matters relating to discovery. See Fed. R. Civ. Ps 26(c) (1)? see 
also In re Chase Manhattan Corp. Sec. Litig., No. 90 CIV. 6092 
(LMM), 1991 WL 79432, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 7, 1991). 
Specifically, the Rule dictates “[t]he court may, for good 
cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or 
expense.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) (1). “This rule confers broad 
discretion on the trial court to decide when a protective order 
is appropriate and what degree of protection is required.” U.S. 
Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Parnon Energy Inc., 593 F. 
App'x 32, 36 (2d Cir. 2014) (citing Seattle Times Co. v. 
Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 36, 104 S.Ct. 2199, 81 L.Ed.2d 17 


(1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 


However, “good cause” is a significant element of the Rule. 
“[D]iscovery should not be routinely stayed simply on the basis 
that a motion to dismiss has been filed.” Moran v. Flaherty, No. 
92 CIV. 3200 (PKL), 1992 WL 276913, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 
1992); see also Usov v. Lazar, No. 13 CIV. 818 RWS, 2013 WL 


3199652, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. June 25, 2013) (“Defendants are 


; Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 28 Filed 01/20/16 Page 4 of 8 


incorrect, though, that discovery must automatically be stayed 
pending a motion to dismiss.”); In re WRT Energy Sec. Litig., 
NOs 96 CIV. 3610 (UFR); 1996 WL 580930, at *1l (S.DeN.Y. Oct. OB, 
1996) (“While discovery may in a proper case be stayed pending 
the outcome of a motion to dismiss, the issuance of a stay is by 
no means automatic.”). The Court analyzes good cause by 
application of three factors: (1) whether a defendant has made a 
strong showing that the plaintiff’s claim is unmeritorious, (2) 
the breadth of discovery and the burden of responding to it, and 
(3) the risk of unfair prejudice to the party opposing the stay. 
Morien v. Munich Reins. Am., Inc., 270 F.R.D. 65, 67 (D. Conn. 


2010); Josie-Delerme v. Am. Gen. Fin. Corp., No. 08 Civ. 3166, 





ZU09 Wh 497609, at *) Ue.D,N.Ys Feb. 26, 2009), 


The Motion to Stay is Denied 


Defendant’s motion to dismiss alleges pleading deficiencies 
in Plaintiff’s complaint and the applicability of the self- 
defense and pre-litigation privileges. See Def.’s Mot. to 
Dismiss. Plaintiff, in turn, addresses each basis for 
Defendant’s dismissal arguments. Pl.’s Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss 
at 5-18. With respect to the pleading deficiencies, Plaintiff 
argues vigorously and in detailed fashion that a defamation 


claim has been adequately pled. Id. at 18-25. With respect to 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 28 Filed 01/20/16 Page 5 of 8 


the privileges, Plaintiff offers several strong arguments to 
challenge Defendant’s motion, including arguments that the 
privileges do not apply substantively, that Plaintiff can defeat 
the qualified privileges with a showing of actual malice, and 
that neither privilege can be properly resolved on a motion to 
dismiss. Id. at 5-18. Plaintiff has pled concrete facts and law 
to support all of her arguments. With strong arguments on both 
sides, Defendant’s argument does not rise to a level of the 
requisite “strong showing” that Plaintiff’s claim is 


unmeritorious. 


With respect to the second factor, Defendant argues that 
discovery in this matter is of wide-breadth, and therefore 
necessarily burdensome. Def.’s Mot to Stay at 3-4. Normal 
discovery in a limited matter does not alone rise to the level 
of good cause. Defendant compares the complexity of this case to 
a case pending in this Court in which a stay of discovery was 
granted. Id. at 3 (“This Court has granted a stay of discovery 
in a recent case involving similarly complex factual questions” 
(citing Spinelli v. Nat'l Football League, No. 13 CIV. 7398 
(RWS), 2015 WL 7302266, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2015)). 
Defendant relies heavily this point, alleging that “the 
potential discovery in Spinelli pales in comparison to the 


anticipated discovery here.” Def.’s Reply at 6. The 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 28 Filed 01/20/16 Page 6 of 8 


circumstances of Spinelli could not be more inapposite to this 
one. That case, in which four separate motions to dismiss were 
pending at the time of the motion to stay, involves seven 
individual plaintiffs against the no less than the entire 
National Football League, 36 affiliated teams, the Associated 
Press, Getty Images, and others. Discovery and relevant factual 
questions were accordingly herculean considerations. Conversely, 
this case involves a single claim against a single defendant, 
related to an ongoing series of events in which Defendant was 
alleged to be personally and intimately involved. See Compl. 
Discovery in this matter is the narrow pole of the scale to 
which Spinelli is the wide-breadth counterpoint. Discovery in 
this case is accordingly tailored to that single claim and the 
associated events. It does not reach such a wide-breadth that 
good cause for a stay exists. Any objections to individual 
discovery requests can be dealt with accordingly, and are not 
proper grounds for a Rule 26 protective order. See Fed. R. Civ. 


P. 34. 


Finally, with respect to unfair prejudice, Defendant 
submits that the requested stay is for the limited period of 
time necessary for the Court to rule on the motion to dismiss, 
and thus Plaintiff would not be unfairly prejudiced. Def.’s Mot. 


to Stay at 2-3. Good cause not otherwise having been shown, lack 


ny 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 28 Filed 01/20/16 Page 7 of 8 


of prejudice does not justify a stay. 


Accordingly, the motion to stay discovery is denied. 


The Motion to Extend the Deadline to Respond or Object to 


Plaintiff's First Request for Production of Documents is Granted 


Defendant was required to respond to Plaintiff’s First 
Request for Production by November 30, 2015. In the alternative 
to Defendant’s request for a stay, Defendant moves for an 
extension of the time to respond or object. Def.’s Mot. to Stay 
at 4. Defendant does not request any particular extension of 


time. 


“If a motion for a protective order is wholly or partly 
denied, the court may, on just terms, order than any part or 
person provide or permit discovery.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) (2). 
Defendant was served with the request on October 27, 2015 and 
has therefore had an additional month and a half to digest the 
requests than is usually permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b) (A). Accordingly, Defendant 
is directed to respond or object to Plaintiff’s First Request 


for Production within fourteen days of the date of this opinion.

Conclusion 


For the foregoing reasons and as set forth above, 
Defendant’s motion to stay is denied, the motion to extend is 


granted, and discovery shall proceed as set forth above.

VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 

PLAINTIFF, : DEFENDANT’S NOTICE OF 
V. SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, , 15-cv-07433-RWS 


DEFENDANT. 


In further support of her Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, Defendant Ghislaine 
Maxwell, through her attorney Laura A. Menninger of the law firm Haddon, Morgan and 
Foreman, P.C., hereby respectfully submits the recent decision in Hill v. Cosby, 15 cv 1658 
(W.D. Pa. January 21, 2016). 

In Hill v. Cosby, the court dismissed, with prejudice, what it found to be a “very detailed 


lo 


and complete Complaint” alleging, among other things, that Cosby defamed an alleged sexual 
assault victim by issuing statements to the press describing the allegations against him as 
“unsubstantiated, fantastical stories...[that] have escalated far past the point of absurdity.” (Ex. 
A at 8). Citing Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 339 (1974), the court held that “[t]his 
sort of purely opnionated speech...is protected and not actionable as defamatory speech.” Jd. In 
dismissing the case, the court further noted that Cosby’s public denial of the claims against him 


was a “legal position” that does not “lead to an inference that Plaintiff is a ‘liar and an 


extortionist.’” Jd. at 8, 12. 


' In fact, the full text of each allegedly defamatory statement was set forth in the 
Complaint. (Ex. A at 8). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 29 Filed 01/22/16 Page 2 of 2 


The facts and arguments set forth in Hill v. Cosby are analogous to those here, and thus 
this newly issued decision is relevant to the arguments advanced by Ms. Maxwell in support of 
her Motion to Dismiss. Ms. Maxwell therefore respectfully requests that the Court take notice of 


this supplemental authority.

ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
Vv. 

WILLIAM HENRY COSBY, JR., an 
individual also known as BILL COSBY, 

Defendant. 

MEMORANDUM OPINION 


The very detailed and complete Complaint in this case alleges that by making or causing 
to be made three very discreet statements: (1) Defendant defamed Plaintiff, (2) Defendant cast 
Plaintiff in a false light, and (3) Defendant intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon 
Plaintiff.' Presently before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss and Brief in Support filed by 
Defendant alleging that no justiciable claim or controversy exists. Doc. nos. 3, 4. Plaintiff filed 
a Response and Brief in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. Doc. nos. 7, 11. Defendant filed a 
Reply Brief. Doc. no. 18. The matter is now ripe for adjudication. For the reasons set forth 


herein, the Court will grant the Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. 


I. Standard of Review - Rule 12(b)(6) 
I. Standard of Review - Rule 12(b)(6) 
Under Rule 12(b)(6), a Complaint must be dismissed for “failure to state a claim upon 


which relief can be granted.” Detailed factual pleading is not required — Rule 8(a)(2) calls for a 





' This case was removed to this Court by Defendant. Plaintiff originally filed her lawsuit in the Court of 
Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (case no. GD-15-18156). Plaintiff did not challenge 
the removal. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). 


Exhibit A 


Césséd 23-mc0O MSS RWS Document 79-1 Fieed DL/226.6 PRage Dias 


“short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief’ — but a 
Complaint must set forth sufficient factual allegations that, taken as true, set forth a plausible 
claim for relief. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). The plausibility standard does not 
require a showing of probability that a claim has merit, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 
544, 556 (2007), but it does require that a pleading show “more than a sheer possibility that a 
defendant has acted unlawfully.” Igbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Determining the plausibility of an 
alleged claim is “‘a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial 
experience and common sense.” Id. at 679 

Building upon the landmark United States Supreme Court decisions in Twombly and 
Iqbal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit explained that a District Court 
must undertake the following three steps to determine the sufficiency of a Complaint: 

First, the court must take note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a 

claim. Second, the court should identify allegations that, because they are no 

more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. Finally, where 

there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity 

and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief. 
Connelly v. Steel Valley Sch. Dist., 706 F.3d 209, 212 (3d Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). 

The third step requires this Court to consider the specific nature of the claims presented 
and to determine whether the facts pled to substantiate the claims are sufficient to show a 
“plausible claim for relief.” Covington v. Int’l Ass’n of Approved Basketball Officials, 710 F.3d 
114, 118 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2010) 
(“[W ]Jhere there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume their veracity and 
then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.”). 


When adjudicating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the Court must view 


all of the allegations and facts in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and 


Céssé4 25-mc0O MES RWS Document 79-1 Filed DL/226.6 PRags Sif48 


must grant the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences that can be derived therefrom. 
Kanter v. Barella, 489 F.3d 170, 177 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 
350 (3d Cir. 2005)). However, the Court need not accept inferences or conclusory allegations 
that are unsupported by the facts set forth in the complaint. See Reuben v. U.S. Airways, Inc., 
500 F. App’x 103, 104 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting Igbal, 556 U.S. at 678); Fowler v. UPMC 
Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009) (stating that District Courts “must accept all of 
the Complaint’s well-pleaded facts as true, but may disregard any legal conclusions”). “While 
legal conclusions can provide the framework of a Complaint, they must be supported by factual 
allegations.” Igbal, 556 U.S. at 664. 

This Court may not dismiss a Complaint merely because it appears unlikely or 
improbable that Plaintiff can prove the facts alleged or will ultimately prevail on the merits. 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563 n.8. Instead, this Court must ask whether the facts alleged raise a 
reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary elements. Jd. at 556. 
Generally speaking, a Complaint that provides adequate facts to establish “how, when, and 
where” will survive a Motion to Dismiss. Fowler, 578 F.3d at 212. 

In short, a Motion to Dismiss should be granted if a party fails to allege facts, which 


could, if established at trial, entitle him/her to relief. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563 n.8. 


Il. Discussion 

As noted above, Plaintiff's Complaint alleges three causes of action against Defendant: 
(1) defamation, (2) false light, and (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress. Defendant 
argues that each of these three claims must be dismissed because the claims are legally 


unsustainable and/or are legally insufficient. Each claim will be addressed, seriatim. 


Césséd 23 mc0v MSS RWS Document 79-1 Feed DL2266 PReg/é 4148 


A. Defamation 
1. Pennsylvania Law 

Under Pennsylvania law — the law applicable to this case’— a plaintiff must eventually 
prove the following seven elements to state a claim for defamation: (1) the defamatory character 
of the communication; (2) its publication by the defendant; (3) its application to the plaintiff; (4) 
the understanding by the recipient of its defamatory meaning; (5) the understanding by the 
recipient of it as intended to be applied to the plaintiff; (6) special harm resulting to the plaintiff 
from its publication; and (7) abuse of a conditionally privileged occasion. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8343. 
There is ample case law emanating from Pennsylvania state courts, as well as the United States 
District Courts, applying Pennsylvania substantive law which defines these elements. A brief 
summary of a portion of that body of law follows. 

In an action for defamation, it is the Court’s duty to make the threshold determination 
whether the challenged statements are capable of a defamatory meaning. Thomas Merton Center 
v. Rockwell International Corp., 442 A.2d 213 (Pa. 1981), cert. den., 457 U.S. 1134 (1982); 
Byars v. School Dist. of Phila., 942 F.Supp.2d 552 (Pa. E.D. 2013) (“Whether a statement is 
capable of a defamatory meaning is a question of law for the court.”). If the communication 
could be understood as defamatory, then it is for the jury to determine whether it was so 
understood by the recipient. Agriss Roadway Exp., Inc., 483 A.2d 456 (Pa. Super. 1984). 

For purposes of the threshold determination whether a communication could be 
understood as defamatory, it is not necessary for the communication actually to have caused 


harm to a plaintiffs reputation; defamatory character depends on the general tendency of the 





* The parties agree, as does this Court, that Pennsylvania substantive law applies to the claims asserted in 
this case. Pennsylvania has a substantial interest in this litigation as Plaintiff was (and is) domiciled in 
Pennsylvania at the time the allegedly defamatory communications were published, and thus Plaintiff has 
a reputational interest to protect in that forum. 


Céssé4 25-mc0v MSS RWS Document 79-1 Fieed DL/226.6 PReg 6 Dif48 


words to have such an effect. Id., citing Corabi v. Curtis Publishing Co., 273 A.2d 899 (Pa. 
1971); Miller v. Hubbard, 207 A.2d 913 (Pa. Super. 1965); Restatement, supra, § 559 Comment 
d. However, it is not sufficient for the words to merely embarrass or annoy the plaintiff. 
Beckman v. Dunn, 419 A.2d 583 (Pa. Super. 1980). A communication is defamatory if it tends 
to blacken a person’s reputation or expose that person to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or 
injure the person in her business or profession. Livingston v. Murray, 612 A.2d 443, 447 (Pa. 
Super. 1992), alloc. den., 617 A.2d 1275 (Pa. 1992). Defamatory communications tend to lower 
a person in the estimation of the community, deter third persons from associating with him or 
her, or adversely affect the person’s fitness for the proper conduct of his or her lawful business or 
profession. Id. 

A plaintiff claiming defamation need not be specifically named in the communication, if 
the plaintiff is pointed to by description or circumstances tending to identify him or her. 
Cosgrove Studio & Camera Shop, Inc. v. Pane, 182 A.2d 751, 753 (Pa. 1962). The test is 
“whether the defamatory communication may reasonably be understood as referring to the 
plaintiff.” Zerpol Corp. v. DMP Corp., 561 F.Supp. 404, 410 (E.D. Pa. 1983) (citing Farrell v. 
Triangle Publ’ns, Inc., 159 A.2d 734 (Pa. 1960)). 

The Pennsylvania Superior Court further explained in Dougherty v. Boyerton Times, 547 
A.2d 778 (Pa. Super. 1988): 

The nature of the audience is a critical factor in determining whether a 
statement is capable of defamatory meaning. . . . Injury to reputation is 
judged by the reaction of other persons in the community and not by the 
party’s self-estimation. Rybas v. Wapner, 311 Pa.Super. 50, 457 A.2d 108 
(1983). Specifically, a communication is defamatory if it “ascribes to 
another conduct, character or a condition that would adversely affect his 
fitness for the proper conduct of his lawful business, trade or profession.” 


Baker v. Lafayette College, 350 Pa.Super. 68, 76, 504 A.2d 247, 251 
(1986) quoting Thomas Merton Center, supra, 422 A.2d at 216. 


Céssé4 23-mc0 MES RWS Document 79-1 Filed DL/226.6 PReg 6 Off48 


Id. at 783. 

Pennsylvania case law also has concluded that only statements of fact can afford a basis 
for a defamation action. Expressions of opinion cannot. Statements of fact and opinion 
intermingled can give rise to a claim based on the factual portions of the statement. See 
Dougherty, 547 A.2d at 782—83 (1988) and Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 556. 

Whether a particular statement constitutes a fact or an opinion is a question of law for the 
trial court to determine. Veno v. Meredith, 515 A.2d 571, 575 (Pa. Super. 1986) citing Braig v. 
Field Communications, 456 A.2d 1366, 1372 (Pa. Super. 1983), cert. den., 466 U.S. 970 (1984). 
In Braig, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania adopted Section 566 of the Restatement (Second) 
of Torts, entitled Expression of Opinion, which provides as follows: 

A defamatory communication may consist of a statement in the form of an 
opinion, but a statement of this nature is actionable only if it implies the 
allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the basis for the opinion. 
Comment (b) to § 566 of the Restatement explains the two types of expressions of opinion: 
(1) The pure type - which “occurs when the maker of the comment states 
the facts on which he bases his opinion of the plaintiff and then expresses 
a comment as to the plaintiff's conduct, qualifications or character.” 
(2) The mixed type - which “while an opinion in form or context, is 
apparently based on facts regarding the plaintiff or his conduct that have 
not been stated by the defendant or assumed to exist by the parties to the 
communication. Here the expression of opinion gives rise to the inference 
that there are undisclosed facts that justify the forming of the opinion 
expressed by the defendant.” 
Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 566, comment (b). Comment (c) of § 566 explains the 
constitutional significance of the distinction explained in comment (b): 
A simple expression of opinion based on disclosed or assumed 
nondefamatory facts is not itself sufficient for an action of defamation, no 
matter how unjustified and unreasonable the opinion may be or how 


derogatory it is. But an expression of opinion that is not based on 
disclosed or assumed facts and therefore implies that there are undisclosed 


Césséd 23-mc0OMtS RWS Document 79-1 Feed DL2266 PReg¢” Hif48 


facts on which the opinion is based, is treated differently. The difference 
lies in the effect upon the recipient of the communication. In the first 
case, the communication itself indicates to him that there is no defamatory 
factual statement. In the second, it does not, and if the recipient draws the 
reasonable conclusion that the derogatory opinion expressed in the 
comment must have been based on undisclosed defamatory facts, the 
defendant is subject to liability. The defendant cannot insist that the 
undisclosed facts were not defamatory but that he unreasonably formed 
the derogatory opinion from them. This is like the case of a 
communication subject to more than one meaning. As stated in § 563, the 
meaning of a communication is that which the recipient correctly, or 
mistakenly but reasonably, understands that it was intended to express. 
Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 566, comment (c). 

Thus, the trial court must determine whether the challenged statement is an opinion or a 
fact. If the challenged statement is an opinion, it is actionable only if it “may reasonably be 
understood to imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts justifying the opinion.” Veno, 
515 A.2d at 575, quoting Beckman, 419 A.2d at 587, citing Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 
566. 

With these principles in mind, the Court proceeds to examine the three challenged 
statements set forth in the instant case. 

2 Plaintiff’s Allegations Related to Defamation 

Turning to the detailed and specific facts alleged by Plaintiff, her Complaint first notes 
that Plaintiff gave an interview with a reporter from KDKA on November 20, 2014 wherein she 
accused Defendant of sexual abuse and rape (doc. no. 1-3, { 38). Plaintiff asserts that as a result 
of this interview, three separate communications (either made by Defendant, or on Defendant’s 
behalf) led to her defamation claim. 

The “Martin Singer Statement” is the first of the three communications which Plaintiff 


alleges is defamatory. In it, Plaintiff alleges that a day or two after she gave her interview, the 


Washington Post published a response whereby “[Defendant], aided by his attorney, Martin 


Césséd 25-mc0O MSS RWS Document 79-1 Filed DL22466 PRag 8 Sf48 


Singer, issued [a] statement . . .” which set forth, in relevant part, that “. . . new, never-before- 
heard claims from women[,] who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, 
fantastical stories . . . have escalated far past the point of absurdity. These brand new claims 
about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous . . . . [I]t makes no sense 
that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time ever asserted a legal 
claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.” The remainder of the 
Martin Singer Statement chastises “the media” for failing to corroborate the new 
“unsubstantiated stories” before publishing their accounts.” 

Second, with respect to the “Florida Today Statement,” Plaintiff alleges that the same day 
the Martin Singer Statement was released, Defendant himself was interviewed by Florida Today, 
and during that interview he declined to respond to the “innuendos” that had been made about 
him and stated that “[p]eople should fact-check”.* 

Third, with respect to the “Camille Cosby Statement,” Plaintiff alleges that on December 
15, 2014, a letter written by Defendant’s wife, Camille Cosby, was published by the Washington 
Post on Defendant’s behalf alleging that the news media failed to “vet” her husband’s accusers 
(of which Plaintiff was one) before publishing or airing the accusers’ stories.” 

a Analysis 

Defendant’s Brief in Support of its Motion to Dismiss contends that none of the three 
statements are actionable as defamation. Doc. no. 4, p. 8. Plaintiff's Brief in Opposition to 
Motion to Dismiss contends that the sum of the three statements “share a common thread of 
relying on undisclosed, defamatory facts to support the assertions each statement makes.” Doc. 


no. 11, p. 7. Plaintiff contends that “[i]f it is reasonable to infer from the statements that

Defendant was actively and knowingly calling Plaintiff a liar and an extortionist, than [sic] the 
statements are capable of defamatory meaning.” Id. 

After careful consideration of each of the three statements set forth in the Complaint, and 
after considering the arguments advanced by each party to this lawsuit as to how those 
statements could or could not be defamatory under Pennsylvania law, this Court finds that none 
of the three statements are defamatory. 

a. The Martin Singer Statement 

The Martin Singer Statement is a pure opinion. Per Plaintiff's Complaint, the Martin 
Singer Statement was made “in response” to Plaintiff's interview wherein she accused Defendant 
of sexually abusing and raping her. Doc. no. 1-3, 38. This statement suggests that “new” 
claims asserted by “new” women — which presumably included Plaintiff's allegations of sexual 
abuse and rape — escalated beyond “the point of absurdity.” Id. Simply put, taking all well pled 
facts as true, and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Martin Singer Statement 
describes the Plaintiff's and other women’s allegations against Defendant as “beyond absurd” 
and labels their accounts of past events as “unsubstantiated, fantastical stories.” 

The entire Martin Singer Statement (as quoted in Plaintiff's Complaint) is an opinionated 
statement; but, it is not one which implies or alleges that undisclosed, defamatory facts serve as 
the basis for the opinion. It was a statement, made by Defendant’s attorney, in response to 
serious allegations concerning Defendant’s alleged criminal behavior. As noted above, in 
Pennsylvania, an opinion cannot be defamatory unless it “may reasonably be understood to 
imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts justifying the opinion.” Remick v. Manfredy, 


238 F.3d 248, 261 (3d Cir. 2001). 


Céssé4 235-mcO MES RWS Document 79-1 Fieed DL/2246.6 PReg 4d Atlas 


Any attorney for any defendant must advance a position contrary to that of the plaintiff. 
Here, Plaintiff publicly claimed she was sexually abused and raped by Defendant — which is her 
position; and Defendant, through his attorney, publicly denied those claims by saying the 
“claims” are unsubstantiated and absurd — which is his legal position. This sort of purely 
opinionated speech articulated by Defendant’s attorney is protected and not actionable as 
defamatory speech. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 339 (1974) (“Under the First 
Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we 
depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of 
other ideas. But there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.”’). This Court does 
not find the Martin Singer Statement includes language which implies the existence of 
undisclosed defamatory facts about Plaintiff. As such, this Court considers the Martin Singer 
Statement to be purely an opinion proffered by an attorney who, while actively engaged in the 
zealous representation of his client, did not cross the line and defame the Plaintiff. Accordingly, 
the Court finds that the Martin Singer Statement fails to support Plaintiffs claim for defamation. 

b. The Florida Today Statement 

Next, turning to the Florida Today Statement, this Court also finds that this statement 
likewise is not defamatory. In this statement, Defendant refuses to respond to “innuendos” and 
invites “people” to “fact-check.” Doc. no. 1-3, [ 41. Although Pennsylvania case law is clear 
that a plaintiff claiming defamation need not be specifically named in the defamatory statement, 
the Florida Today Statement fails to even generally refer to the group of women who publicly 
asserted their allegations of sexual misconduct against Defendant. 

However, viewing this statement in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, given the timing of 


this statement, the Court will assume, arguendo, that Defendant was referring to Plaintiff's and 


10 


Céssé4 235 mc0O MES RWS Document 79-1 Fiteled@ DL/2246.6 Pee 4.1 DiL48 


other women’s accusations as “innuendos,” and was encouraging the public to “fact-check” the 
claims of these women. This is a far cry from labelling Plaintiff (and the other women who have 
made similar public assertions) as liars or extortionists. 

Pennsylvania law requires that Defendant’s words have the general tendency to cause 
harm to Plaintiff's reputation. It is not sufficient if the words are merely embarrassing or 
annoying to Plaintiff. The words uttered by Defendant, and made public in his Florida Today 
Statement, which invite the public to conduct its own investigation and draw its own conclusions 
about the “innuendos,” i.e., the alleged sexual misconduct of Defendant, do not have the general 
tendency to cause harm to anyone’s reputation and, thus, do not rise to the level of defamatory 
comments. 

c The Camille Cosby Statement 

Finally, the Camille Cosby Statement fails to meet Pennsylvania’s legal requirements 
necessary to assert a claim for defamation. The majority of this statement expresses the 
speaker’s opinion that the media outlets violated their own code of journalistic integrity by 
publishing Plaintiffs (and the other women’s) accounts of the alleged sexual abuse without 
“vetting” these accusers. This statement targets the media as much, and arguably more so, than 
the accusers, by claiming that the media failed to properly source or “vet” Plaintiff's and the 
other women’s stories before publishing them. The accusation made by Camille Cosby appears 
to target the media for failing to get a second source before printing Plaintiff’s, and/or other 


; ; : 6 
women’s very serious accusations regarding Defendant. 





° Even assuming that the “vetting” referred to Plaintiff herself, and not Plaintiff’s “story,” the Camille 
Cosby Statement suggests that the media did not do its job of investigating Plaintiff prior to publishing 
Plaintiff's account of the alleged sexual abuse. Even construed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, the 
Camille Cosby Statement does not infer that there is some undisclosed fact or facts about this specific 
Plaintiff which Camille Cosby herself knew. Moreover, although Plaintiff has pled that Camille Cosby 
was Defendant’s business manager, and claims that Camille Cosby’s statements could be attributable to 


11 


Césséd 23 mc0O MSS RWS Document 79-1 Fieed DL/226.6 PRgg4d.4DL48 


In addition, the timing of this statement is further removed from the timing of Plaintiffs 
own accusations. This Court does not find that this Statement could be read to infer that Plaintiff 
is a liar or an extortionist and it does not possess the general tendency to cause harm to Plaintiff's 
reputation. Thus, this Statement fails to support a claim for defamation. 

d. All Three Statements Together 

Finally, Plaintiff's Brief in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss contends that the sum of 
the three statements “share a common thread of relying on undisclosed, defamatory facts to 
support the assertions each statement makes.” Plaintiff contends that “[i]f it is reasonable to 
infer from the statements that Defendant was actively and knowingly calling Plaintiff a liar and 
an extortionist, than [sic] the statements are capable of defamatory meaning.” Doc. no. 11, p. 7. 
Even considering these three statements together as a combined, single statement, this newly 
“conjoined” statement does not lead to an inference that Plaintiff is a “liar and an extortionist.” 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's claim for defamation will be granted. 

B. False Light 

Under Pennsylvania law, a claim for false light is one of four torts which can support a 
claim for invasion of privacy. Santillo v. Reed, 634 A.2d 264 (Pa. Super. 1993). To establish a 
false light invasion of privacy claim, Pennsylvania law requires a plaintiff to show that a highly 
offensive false statement was publicized by a defendant with knowledge or in reckless disregard 
of the falsity. Id., citing, Neish v. Beaver Newspapers, Inc., 581 A.2d 619, 624 (Pa. Super. 


1990), alloc. den., 593 A.2d 421 (Pa. 1991). 





Defendant, this is a legal conclusion which Plaintiff draws with no factual support. Thus, even if the 
Camille Cosby Statement could be read to infer that Camille Cosby had undisclosed defamatory facts 
related to this specific Plaintiff, the Court has no basis upon which it can legally conclude that this 
Statement can be attributed to Defendant or was authorized by him. 


12 


Céssé4 25 mc0 MES RWS Document 79-1 Filed DL/226.6 PReag a4 SL48 


Pennsylvania Courts have relied upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652E for 
distinguishing a false light claim from a defamation claim. Comment “b.” to this Section of the 
Restatement reads as follows: 


b. Relation to defamation. The interest protected by this Section is 
the interest of the individual in not being made to appear before the public 
in an objectionable false light or false position, or in other words, 
otherwise than as he is. In many cases to which the rule stated here 
applies, the publicity given to the plaintiff is defamatory, so that he would 
have an action for libel or slander under the rules stated in Chapter 24. In 
such a case the action for invasion of privacy will afford an alternative or 
additional remedy, and the plaintiff can proceed upon either theory, or 
both, although he can have but one recovery for a single instance of 
publicity. 


It is not, however, necessary to the action for invasion of privacy 
that the plaintiff be defamed. It is enough that he is given unreasonable 
and highly objectionable publicity that attributes to him characteristics, 
conduct or beliefs that are false, and so is placed before the public in a 
false position. When this is the case and the matter attributed to the 
plaintiff is not defamatory, the rule here stated affords a different remedy, 
not available in an action for defamation. 


Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652E, comment b. Comment “c.” defines the term 
“highly offensive” in this manner: 


c. Highly offensive to a reasonable person. The rule stated in this 
Section applies only when the publicity given to the plaintiff has placed 
him in a false light before the public, of a kind that would be highly 
offensive to a reasonable person. In other words, it applies only when the 
defendant knows that the plaintiff, as a reasonable man, would be justified 
in the eyes of the community in feeling seriously offended and aggrieved 
by the publicity. Complete and perfect accuracy in published reports 
concerning any individual is seldom attainable by any reasonable effort, 
and most minor errors, such as a wrong address for his home, or a mistake 
in the date when he entered his employment or similar unimportant details 
of his career, would not in the absence of special circumstances give any 
serious offense to a reasonable person. The plaintiff's privacy is not 
invaded when the unimportant false statements are made, even when they 
are made deliberately. It is only when there is such a major 
misrepresentation of his character, history, activities or beliefs that serious 
offense may reasonably be expected to be taken by a reasonable man in 
his position, that there is a cause of action for invasion of privacy. 


13 


Césséd 235 mc0O MES RWS Document 79-1 Fieed DL/226.6 PRegd.4 Sl48 


Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652E, comment c. 

In the instant case, none of the three statements described above can be said to be “highly 
offensive” as that term is defined. Plaintiff's Complaint asserts that the three statements were 
“highly offensive” (see doc. no. 1-3, { 58), but this is a legal conclusion. The Complaint is 
otherwise devoid of any facts which support Plaintiff’s legal conclusion that the three statements 
are “highly offensive.” 

Moreover, none of the three statements specifically malign Plaintiff individually. Even if 
Plaintiff need not be specifically named in the statement which forms the basis for a false light 
claim (as is true for a defamation claim) in order to prove that the statement cast her in a false 
light, Plaintiff must still show that the conduct was “highly offensive” to her, as a reasonable 
person. None of the three statements provide a factual basis upon which this Court could find 
that “serious offense” could reasonably have been expected to be taken by a reasonable person in 
Plaintiff's position. As such, Plaintiffs allegations set forth in her Complaint fall short of 
providing a basis for her claim for false light, and thus, the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's false 
light claim will be granted. 

C. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress 

The Superior Court of Pennsylvania in Britt v. Chestnut Hill Coll. held as follows: 


Intentional infliction of emotional distress is defined in the Restatement 
(Second) of Torts as follows: 


One who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or 
recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to 
liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other 
results from it, for such bodily harm. 


Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 46(1). 


14 


Céssé4 23-mcO MES RWS Document 79-1 Filed DL/2246.6 PReg4d.4 SiL48 


In addition to requiring that a plaintiff establish that the conduct 
complained of was outrageous, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has 
required that the plaintiff present competent medical evidence to support 
the claim. In Kazatsky v. King David Memorial Park, 515 Pa. 183, 527 
A.2d 988 (1987), our supreme court affirmed this court’s order sustaining 
a compulsory nonsuit for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional 
distress. Initially, the court noted that while it had previously 
acknowledged Section 46, it had never “had occasion to specifically adopt 
section 46 as the law in Pennsylvania”. Jd. With that in mind, the court 
ultimately held that “if section 46 of the Restatement is to be accepted in 
this Commonwealth, at the very least, existence of the alleged emotional 
distress must be supported by competent medical evidence.” Kazatsky, 
515 Pa. at 197, 527 A.2d at 988 (1987). Applying that standard to the 
facts before it, the supreme court sustained the compulsory nonsuit 
because the record revealed that neither appellant had sought medical 
treatment and that they failed to support their claim with competent 
medical evidence. 


Britt, 632 A.2d 557, 561 (Pa. Super. 1993). The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has held that in 
order to sustain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must allege that 
the defendant “‘has acted with intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he had intended to 
inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by ‘malice,’ or a 
degree of aggravation that would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort.” Hoy 
v. Angelone, 720 A.2d 745 (Pa. 1998). 

Turning to the facts of this case, Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional 
distress (“IED”) turns on the alleged facts that Defendant drugged her, sexually abused and 
raped her, and then called her a “liar and extortionist” after she publicly disclosed what he had 
allegedly done to her. Doc. no. 1-3, {{{[ 65-66. The three statements referenced in the 
Complaint, only one of which was uttered by Defendant himself, form the basis of her IIED 
claim. Two of these statements — the Martin Singer Statement and the Camille Cosby Statement 
— were not made by Defendant, the alleged attacker. Even assuming those two statements could 


be attributable to Defendant, through his agents — his attorney and wife — these three statements 


15 


Céssé4 23 mc0O MES RWS Document 79-1 Fieed DL/2246.6 PReg 4d 4 Olas 


would have to expressly and/or impliedly deny that Defendant sexually abused and raped 
Plaintiff. 

While none of the three statements go so far as to expressly deny that Defendant sexually 
abused and raped Plaintiff, read in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, this Court will consider 
whether they impliedly deny that Defendant did so. Assuming, arguendo, that the statements 
deny Defendant sexually abused and raped Plaintiff, the question next becomes whether that 
language so outrageous, atrocious, and contemptable that those statements could give rise to an 
IIED claim. The Court finds that the language does not rise to the level of outrage necessary to 
sustain an ITED claim under Pennsylvania law. 

In addition, the Court notes — as do both Plaintiff and Defendant in their respective briefs 
— that no Pennsylvania case law exists upholding an ILED claim which has been predicated upon 
defamatory language. See doc. no. 4, p. 14 and doc. no. 11, p. 14. Plaintiff argues that simply 
because Pennsylvania has not yet allowed such a cause of action, it has not prohibited one either. 
Doc. no. 11, p. 14. This Court takes no position on what Pennsylvania Courts may or may 
choose not do with respect to any future ITED claim predicated on an alleged defamatory 
statement(s). However, this Court does not find that the type of denials published in the three 
statements rise to the level of atrocious conduct necessary to preserve an ITED claim under 
Pennsylvania law. Without any legal support suggesting that an ITED claim can be predicated 
upon alleged defamatory language, and after concluding as a matter of law that the language 


itself is not defamatory, this Court must dismiss Plaintiff's ITED claim. 


III. Conclusion 


16 


Césséd 23 mc0O MES RWS Document 79-1 Fiteled@ DL226.6 PRgg 4.71 O10L48 


As explained in detail above, each of the three claims asserted by Plaintiff will be 
dismissed. Each of the claims as asserted by Plaintiff in her Complaint fails as a matter of law. 
Even assuming the veracity of all that Plaintiff has pled here, the three statements do not support 
a claim for defamation as defined by Pennsylvania law. Likewise, the Plaintiff's Complaint fails 
to establish viable claims for false light or intentional infliction of emotional distress as those 
torts are defined by Pennsylvania law. 

Typically, the Court allows a plaintiff to amend a Complaint that is legally deficient 
unless doing so would be futile. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 
1434 (3d Cir.1997) (“.. . a district court may exercise its discretion and deny leave to amend on 
the basis of . . . futility.”). Given the state of the law on this matter, as will be discussed in 
greater detail below, any amendment would be futile, and thus Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss 
will be granted with prejudice. 

The Complaint in this case is very detailed and complete, drafted by experienced counsel. 
The three complained-of Statements are set forth in great detail. An Amended Complaint could 
not add anything to these three Statements. The Court is confident that if counsel for Plaintiff 
had additional complained-of statements, those additional statements would have been made part 
of the Complaint. 

Accordingly, the Court finds that allowing Plaintiff time to amend her Complaint would 
be futile, and thus, the Court will grant Defendant’s Motion and dismiss this case with prejudice. 


An appropriate Order shall follow.

TO DEFENDANT’S NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY 


In response to Defendant’s Notice of Supplemental Authority [D.E. # 29], Plaintiff 
Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully states as follows: 

As recounted by Defendant’s Notice of Supplemental Authority, the Hi// Court found that 
Cosby’s statements were not defamatory because they did not “lead to an inference that Plaintiff 
is a ‘liar and an extortionist.’” In vivid contrast, Maxwell called Ms. Giuffre’s assertions of 
sexual abuse “obvious lies.” It is axiomatic that a person telling “obvious lies” is a liar, and, 


therefore, the reasoning employed by the Hi// court is inapplicable to the statements made by 


Maxwell.

Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully submits 
this Motion to Compel Production of Documents Subject to Improper Claim of Attorney-Client 
Privilege and Common Interest Privilege. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should grant 
Plaintiffs Motion in its entirety. 

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

Defendant Maxwell asserts improper claims of attorney-client privilege and common 
interest in her privilege log in a wrongful attempt to withhold responsive documents from 
discovery. See Declaration of Sigrid McCawley (“McCawley Decl.”) at Exhibit 1, Maxwell’s 
Privilege Log'. The documents at issue include communications solely between Maxwell and 
other non-attorneys, and communications between Maxwell and an attorney in which third 
parties are present, waiving the privilege. New York privilege law does not recognize such 
communications as being privileged in any way. To the contrary, New York state and federal 
courts require that such communications be produced. 

In addition, Maxwell has failed to furnish an adequate privilege log, making it impossible 
for Plaintiff to assess the propriety of the privilege claims, and that is grounds for rejecting a 
claim of privilege, as discussed below. S.E.C. v. Yorkville Advisors, LLC, 300 F.R.D. 152, 164 
(S.D.N.Y. 2014). 

Finally, Ms. Maxwell’s privilege log states that she is withholding documents “pursuant 
to British law” and Colorado law. However, British law and Colorado law do not apply to this 
case, as Maxwell has already conceded. New York law applies to this case. See Defendant 
Ghislaine Maxwell’s Memorandum of Law In Support of Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 15] 
(“Maxwell MTD”) at 7. (“Here, because Ms. Maxwell is a resident of New York, and one of the 
purported statements was made in New York, this state has arguably a more substantial 


' The number of each log entry has been added for ease of reference in this Motion. 


relationship to the alleged tort . . . For these reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to apply New 
York law .. .”). Accordingly, the privileges she claims must be under New York law, and all 
other claims of purported privilege are invalid. 
II. LEGAL ARGUMENT 

1. Legal Standard 


a. New York Privilege Law Controls 


New York law governs the analysis of attorney-client privilege claims in this diversity 
action arising out of New York law.” See Allied Irish Banks v. Bank of Am., N.A., 240 F.R.D. 96, 
102 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (“Because this Court's subject matter jurisdiction is based upon diversity . . 
. State law provides the rule of decision concerning the claim of attorney-client privilege’), 
citing Fed.R.Evid. 501; Dixon v. 80 Pine St. Corp., 516 F.2d 1278, 1280 (2d Cir.1975). The 
privilege laws of any other jurisdiction, including Colorado and the United Kingdom, do not 
apply to Ms. Maxwell’s documents. 

New York's statutory codification of the attorney-client privilege provides as follows: “an 
attorney or his or her employee, or any person who obtains without the knowledge of the client 
evidence of a confidential communication made between the attorney or his or her employee and 
the client in the course of professional employment, shall not disclose, or be allowed to disclose 
such communication, nor shall the client be compelled to disclose such communication ....” N.Y. 
C.P.L.R. § 4503(a)(1). 

“The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer 
and client relating to legal advice sought by the client.” Jn re Nassau Cnty. Grand Jury Subpoena 
Duces Tecum Dated June 24, 2003, 4 N.Y.3d 665, 678, 797 N.Y.S.2d 790, 830 N.E.2d 1118 


* In the Motion to Dismiss, Maxwell does not dispute that NY law applies. See D.E. 15, Maxwell MTD 
at 7. 


(2005) (citing Priest v. Hennessy, 51 N.Y.2d 62, 68-69, 431 N.Y.S.2d 511, 409 N.E.2d 983 
(1980)) (additional citation omitted). For the privilege to apply, the communication itself must 
be “primarily or predominantly of a legal character.” Delta Fin. Corp. v. Morrison, 13 Misc. 3d 
441, 444, 820 N.Y.S.2d 745, 748 (Sup. Ct. 2006) “The critical inquiry is whether, viewing the 
lawyer's communication in its full content and context, it was made in order to render legal 
advice or services to the client.” Allied Irish Banks, 240 F.R.D. at 103 (2007) (finding that party 
had not met its burden showing the applicability of the attorney-client privilege nor met its 
burden showing that any privilege has not been waived). 

The party asserting privilege carries the burden to prove every element of the privilege. 
People v. Mitchell, 58 N.Y.2d 368, 373, 461 N.Y.S.2d 267, 448 N.E.2d 121 (1983). The party 
asserting privilege also has the burden to establish that there has been no waiver. Egiazaryan v. 
Zalmayey, 290 F.R.D. 421, 428 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). Such showings must be based on competent 
evidence, usually through affidavits, deposition testimony, or other admissible evidence. See Von 
Bulow by Auersperg v. Von Bulow, 811 F.2d 136, 147 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1015, 107 
S.Ct. 1891, 95 L.Ed.2d 498 (1987); Bowne of N.Y.C., Inc. v. AmBase Corp., 150 F.R.D. 465, 472 
(S.D.N.Y.1993). Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290 F.R.D. 421, 428 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) 

b. The Common Interest Privilege Dose Not Apply 

Maxwell asserts a “common interest” privilege in entries 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 19, and 20, but 
on their face, as Maxwell herself describes them, these entries do not qualify for this privilege 
because no attorney is involved in the communications. The common interest privilege also fails 
for entry 16 because Ms. Maxwell fails to satisfy her burden in making such a claim. 

“New York courts applying the common interest rule to civil proceedings have often 


looked to federal case law for guidance.” Egiazaryan, 290 F.R.D. at 433. “The common interest 


rule is an extension of the attorney-client privilege and not an independent basis for privilege.” 
Pem-Am., Inc. v. Sunham Home Fashions, LLC, No. 03 CIV. 1377JFKRLE, 2007 WL 3226156, 
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 31, 2007). “In order for a communication to be privileged within the 
common interest rule, it... must still meet the requirements of a privileged attorney-client 
communication.” Id. (Emphasis added). 

“[T]he so-called joint defense privilege or common interest rule . . . serves to protect the 
confidentiality of communications passing from one party to the attorney for another party 
where a joint defense effort or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and 
their respective counsel.” Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. 168, 203 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). “A party asserting it first must establish 
that the documents purportedly subject to the rule are in fact attorney-client communications 
subject to the attorney-client privilege.” /d. Further: 

[a]s in all claims of privilege arising out of the attorney-client relationship, a claim 

resting on the common interest rule requires a showing that the communication in 

question was given in confidence and that the client reasonably understood it to be so 
given. And once the party claiming common interest privilege has established that the 
documents in question are subject to the attorney-client privilege, it must further show 
that (1) it shares a common legal interest with the party with whom the documents or 
information were shared, and (2) the statements for which protection is sought were 
designed to further that interest. 

Id. (internal quotes omitted, emphasis added). The “joint defense” or “common interest” 

privilege does not protect any of the documents for which Ms. Maxwell invokes the privilege. 

The “common interest” or “joint defense” privilege can only be invoked when at least 
one attorney for one of the parties is present for the communication. Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 


290 F.R.D. 421, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“communications are protected where there is a 


disclosure by A to the attorney representing B and vice-versa’). Therefore, Maxwell’s 


communications with other parties, outside the presence of counsel for either party, does not 
come under the common interest or joint defense privilege under New York law, and Maxwell 
must produce these communications. 

Despite there being no attorney involved in the communications, Maxwell asserts the 
common interest privilege in all her communications with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. 
See entries 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 19, and 20, Maxwell Privilege Log. In addition to the reasons above, 
this assertion also fails because “[t]he common interest rule does not apply merely because two 
parties share the same attorney or because one party has an interest in a litigation involving 
another party. Rather, ‘[t]here must be a substantial showing by parties attempting to invoke the 
protections of the privilege of the need for a common defense as opposed to the mere existence 
of acommon problem.’ Finkelman v. Klaus, 2007 WL 4303538, at *4 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. Nov. 28, 
2007).” Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290 F.R.D. at 434. To be sure, Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey 
Epstein share a common problem: they both trafficked an underage girl for prostitution. 
However, Ms. Maxwell has offered no proof of a common interest under the applicable law 
between herself and Epstein that would satisfy this doctrine, a doctrine which cannot be invoked 
anyway, due to the absence of the attorney-client privilege for these non-attorney 
communications. 

The remaining document that purports to be covered by the “common interest” privilege, 
entry 16, is an email communication between Philip Barden, Esq. and Martin Weinberg, Esq. 
This assertion of privilege also fails. Ms. Maxwell has made no showing whatsoever that any 
“common interest” exists between Barden and Weinberg; she doesn’t even identify who they are 


or what clients they represent. Therefore, this communication does not fall within that privilege. 


Furthermore, the burden of establishing that a “common interest” privilege applies 
always rests upon the person asserting it. Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. 168, 203 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). This showing must be made on a document-by-document basis, and based on 
competent evidence, usually through the admission of affidavits, deposition testimony or other 
admissible evidence. Jd. Ms. Maxwell has put forth no evidence or argument that there exists a 
joint defense agreement between the parties represented by Mr. Barden and Mr. Weinberg; 
therefore, Maxwell has not met her burden in establishing that a “joint defense” agreement even 
exists. 

For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell should produce entries 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 16, 19, 
and 20 because she cannot, as a matter of law, show that the common interest privilege exist as 
to entries 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 19, and 20, and she has failed to satisfy her burden to make any 


showing that there exists a common interest agreement that would protect entry number 16. 


2. No Privilege Attaches to Communications Between Maxwell and Non- 
Attorneys 


a. Communications with Non-Attorney Jeffrey Epstein and Non-Attorney 
Ross Gow’ 





Maxwell wrongly asserts a “common interest” privilege for communications with 
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in entries 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 19, 20, and with Ross Gow in 
entries 3, 4, and 5. As discussed above, no privilege can attach because no legal advice was 
sought or rendered among these three non-attorneys. Moreover, neither billionaire Epstein nor 
Ms. Maxwell is a legal professional, paralegal, or part of a related trade, nor are they directly 
supervised by an attorney. Therefore, the communications made among each other are not 


covered by any privilege that attaches to the communications to those acting “under the authority 


> Ms. Maxwell’s communications with Gow are key documents in this case, as the sole claim concerns 
Ms. Maxwell defaming Ms. Giuffre in the press, yet Maxwell has arbitrarily refused to produce this 
highly relevant discovery. 


or control of an attorney.” See, e.g., In re Rivastigmine IT, 237 F.R.D. 69, 82 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). 
Even if legal advice was being discussed back and forth among those non-attorneys, such 
communications still would not fall under the ambit of attorney-client privilege (or, derivatively, 
common interest privilege) under New York law. See Finkelman v. Klaus, 17 Misc. 3d 1138(A), 
856 N.Y.S.2d 23 (Sup. Ct. 2007) (“[The attorney-client privilege] does not, however, cover 
communications between a non-lawyer and a client that involve the conveyance of legal advice 
offered by the non-attorney, except perhaps when the non-lawyer is acting under the supervision 
or the direction of an attorney.”). Accordingly, there is no mechanism that would attach any 
privilege to the communications between Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein and between Ms. 


Maxwell and Ross Gow. 


b. Communications among Maxwell, Non-Attorney Ross Gow, and 
Attorneys 


Ms. Maxwell wrongly asserts attorney-client privilege for communications among her 
press agent and attorneys in entries 8, 10, 12, 13, and 18. This also fails. Under New York law, 
coordination of a media campaign among counsel and a public relations firm is not “legal 
advice” subject to attorney-client privilege. See Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290 F.R.D. 421, 431 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (finding waiver of attorney-client privilege when the public relations firm 
participated in attorney-client communications: “[the party] has not shown that [the public 
relation’s firm’s] involvement was necessary to facilitate communications between himself and 
his counsel, as in the case of a translator or an accountant clarifying communications between an 


attorney and client”).* 


* “Tt is settled that communications made between a client and lawyer in the presence of a third party are 
not privileged.” Klein, Varble & Associates, P.C. v. DeCrescenzo, 39 Misc. 3d 1240(A), 975 N.Y.S.2d 
366 (Sup. Ct. 2013) affd as modified, 119 A.D.3d 655, 988 N.Y.S.2d 897 (2014). 


The Egiazaryan court explained: “[the public relations firm] was not competent to act as 
[the party’s] attorney and the mere fact that it was inserted into the legal decisionmaking process 
does nothing to explain why [the public relation’s firm’s] involvement was necessary to [the 
party’s] obtaining legal advice from his actual attorneys. Instead, it simply demonstrates the 
circumstances under which the waiver occurred.” Jd. See also NXIVM Corp. v. O'Hara, 241 
F.R.D. 109, 141 (N.D.N.Y. 2007) (agency exception to the attorney-client privilege is 
inapplicable under New York law to communications with a public relations firm “providing 
ordinary public relations advice and assist[ing] counsel in assessing the probable public reaction 
to various strategic alternatives”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Nance v. 
Thompson Med. Co., 173 F.R.D. 178, 182—83 (E.D.Tex. 1997) (waiver of attorney-client 
privilege occurred under New York law when otherwise privileged documents were shared with 
a public relations firm). 

Ross Gow is a public relations professional. He is a managing partner at ACUITY 
Reputation in London, a public relations firm.” ACUITY Reputation does not provide legal 
advice, but instead helps clients “manage reputation and forge opinion through Public Relations, 


”° Ms. Maxwell has made no representation 


strategic communications and high-level networking. 
or showing that Gow was “called upon to perform a specific litigation task that the attorneys 
needed to accomplish in order to advance their litigation goals - let alone a task that could be 


666 


characterized as relating to the “‘administration of justice.’” Egiazaryan, 290 F.R.D. at 432. 
Rather, Ross Gow “was involved in . . . public relations activities aimed at burnishing” Ms. 


Maxwell’s image. Jd. 


> Upon information and belief, Ross Gow’s LinkedIn profile, detailing his profession, See McCawley 
Decl. at Exhibit 2. 


° ACUITY Reputation website at: http://acuityreputation.com/ 


Therefore, any attorney-client privilege that may, have attached to her communications 
with attorneys Jaffe and Barden’, was waived through their disclosure to the third-party public 
relations professional because there has been no showing that Gow’s involvement was necessary 
to facilitate communications between Ms. Maxwell and attorneys Jaffe and Barden. See 
Egiazaryan, 290 F.R.D. at 433. In fact, such a showing would be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to 
make under existing case law. There are no foreign language barriers or complex technical 
jargon barriers between Maxwell and her counsel that would require a public relations 
professional to act as an intermediary to translate the communications between attorney and 
client.* Gow is merely a public relations professional, working at a public relations firm, who 
issued a statement to the press on behalf of Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, Maxwell’s claims of 


attorney-client privilege for entries 8, 10, 12, 13, and 18 fail. 


Cc. The Communication among Maxwell, Not-Attorney Mark Cohen, and 
Attorney 


As stated above, “[i]t is settled that communications made between a client and lawyer in 
the presence of a third party are not privileged.” Klein, Varble & Associates, P.C. v. 
DeCrescenzo, 39 Misc. 3d 1240(A), 975 N.Y.S.2d 366 (Sup. Ct. 2013) aff'd as modified, 119 
A.D.3d 655, 988 N.Y.S.2d 897 (2014). The communication between Ms. Maxwell and Philip 
Barden, Esq. was in the presence of third party, non-attorney Mark Cohen. Therefore, Ms. 


Maxwell’s claim of attorney-client privilege fails, and she must produce entry 17. 


7 Ms. Maxwell has not met her burden to demonstrate that any attorney-client privilege attaches to her 
communications with Jaffe and Barden. Indeed, she has not even alleged that they represent her. 


* <A] communication between an attorney and a third party does not become shielded by the attorney- 


client privilege solely because the communication proves important to the attorney's ability to represent 
the client.” United States v. Ackert, 169 F.3d 136, 140 (2d Cir.1999). 


d. Communications Involving Maxwell and Brett Jaffe or Philip Barden 


Maxwell has not carried out her burden of establishing that the attorney-client privilege 
attaches to the communications with Brett Jaffe, Esq. or Philip Barden, Esq. First, she has not 
even claimed that she has an attorney-client relationship with either Jaffe or Barden. Second, she 
has not claimed that the communications were seeking legal advice or receiving legal advice, as 
her “descriptions” are wholly inadequate, as discussed below. Every one of them simply states: 
“Communication re: legal advice.” This is the same, rote description she gives even to her 
emails with non-lawyers. 

As this Court is aware, not all communications with an attorney are privileged. The 
attorney-client privilege only encompasses confidential communications necessary to obtain 
informed legal advice and advocacy. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Served Upon 
Shargel, 742 F.2d 61, 62 (2d Cir.1984). Indeed, “[a] communication which has no direct 
relevance to the legal advice to be given, unlike a communication which relates to the subject 
matter of the attorney's professional employment, is a collateral matter, which is not privileged.” 
Sarfati v. Bertino, 24 Misc. 3d 133(A), 890 N.Y.S.2d 371 (App. Term 2009). 

The attorney-client privilege is also narrowly interpreted: “[s]ince the privilege prevents 
disclosure of relevant evidence and thus impedes the quest for truth, ... it must “be strictly 
confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle.” ’ See In 
re Shargel, 742 F.2d at 62 . (quoting 8 J. WIGMORE, EVIDENCE § 2291 (McNaughton rev. 
ed.1961)). 

That Gow, a public relations professional, was involved in so many of the 
communications with Jaffe and Barden, creates a presumption that these communications 


focused on public relations matters, and were not centered on giving legal advice. The attorney- 


10 


client privilege “does not extend to business advice, even if provided by an attorney.” Stenovich 
v. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 195 Misc. 2d 99, 106-07, 756 N.Y.S.2d 367, 376 (Sup. Ct. 
2003), citing Fine v. Facet Aerospace Prod. Co., 133 F.R.D. 439, 444 (S.D.N.Y.1990). By the 
same principle, public relations advice, even if given by an attorney, is not privileged. For the 
foregoing reasons, Maxwell has not met her burden to show that these communications are 
privileged. 

Finally, this Court should note that in Defendant’s Initial Disclosures, she stated that 
“Email correspondence between Philip Barden and Ghislaine Maxwell concerning the issuance 
of statements to the press (March 2011 — January 2015)” are among the documents that “may be 
used to support Defendant’s claim or defenses.” Despite this statement in her Rule 26 
disclosures, Maxwell still wrongfully asserts attorney-client privilege for these documents. 

This is more evidence that this defendant is attempting to impermissibly use the attorney- 
client privilege as a sword and a shield, as her disclosures reveal she intends to selectively use 
these purportedly privileged documents to make her defense. New York law does not permit 
self-serving, selective disclosure of privileged materials. “[P]rivilege is a shield and must not be 
used as a sword. Where a party places the subject matter of a normally privileged communication 
or document at issue, or, where invasion of the privilege is required to determine the validity of 
the claim or defense and the application of the privilege would deprive the adversary of vital 
information, fairness requires the finding of waiver.” Century Indem. Co. v. Brooklyn Union Gas 
Co., 22 Misc. 3d 1109(A), 880 N.Y.S.2d 222 (Sup. Ct. 2008) (internal quotations and citations 
omitted). See also United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (2d Cir. 1991) (“[T]he 
attorney-client privilege cannot at once be used as a shield and a sword. ... The privilege takes 


flight if the relation is abused.... A defendant may not use the privilege to prejudice his 


11 


opponent's case or to disclose some selected communications for self-serving purposes. ... Thus, 
the privilege may implicitly be waived when defendant asserts a claim that in fairness requires 
examination of protected communications.”’) (internal quotations and citations omitted). 

For all of the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell should disclose these documents relevant 


to entry numbers 1, 2, and 9. 


3. Maxwell’s Privilege Log Descriptions Are Inadequate 


“Failure to furnish an adequate privilege log is grounds for rejecting a claim of attorney 
client privilege.” Aurora Loan Servs., Inc. v. Posner, Posner & Assocs., P.C., supra, 499 
F.Supp.2d 475, 479 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). The information set forth in Maxwell’s log is too sparse to 
comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5) and Local Rule 26.2(a)(2)(B)'s 
requirement that a party asserting privilege disclose information sufficient “to enable other 
parties to assess the claim.” The limited “descriptions” on the privilege log make it impossible 
for Plaintiffs to assess the propriety of the privilege claims. 

Over, and over again, each and every entry on the Maxwell Privilege Log insufficiently 
describes the subject matter of the communications as “Communication re: legal advice.” See 
McCawley Decl. at Composite Exhibit 1. Maxwell, has failed to comply with Local Rule 
26.2(a)(2)(B), which requires that “the general subject matter of the communication” be stated in 
the privilege log. The “subject matter” is not stated; it does not even indicate the matter or 
general topic upon which the purported attorney-client communication was made. Therefore, 
there is no “basis to conclude that the document contains legal advice that reelects a client 
confidence.” Yorkville Advisors, LLC, 300 F.R.D. at 164. With these unvarying and scanty 
descriptions, there is no way to assess if the withheld documents do, in fact, contain privileged 


material. 


12 


For example, in Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, the Court held that descriptions such as, 
“Email concerning litigation status and strategy,” and “Email concerning litigation status and 
strategy re Lago Agrio litigation” were inadequate. No. 11 CIV. 0691 LAK JCF, 2013 WL 
4045326, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2013). Yet even those brief descriptions, rejected by the 
Chevron Court, are a surfeit of information and detail compared to Ms. Maxwell’s paltry, one- 
size-fits-all “Communication re: legal advice.” Therefore, controlling precedent requires a 
finding that the Maxwell Privilege Log is inadequate.’ 

Furthermore, the descriptions do not provide the titles or the roles of the authors and 
recipients, which also makes this privilege log inadequate. See S.E.C. v. Yorkville Advisors, LLC, 
300 F.R.D. 152, 164 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). For example, for claims of attorney-client privilege, Ms. 
Maxwell does not even assert that individuals such as Brett Jaffe, Philip Barden, or Martin 
Weinberg represent her, or that any attorney-client relationship exists between them. 
Furthermore, there is no explanation as to how she could possibly claim an attorney-client 
privilege with non-attorney Ross Gow and non-attorney Jeffrey Epstein, as discussed above. 

For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s Privilege Log fails to provide the information 
required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5) and Local Civil Rule 26.2(a)(2)(A), and it 
does not provide sufficient information to support the privilege claims asserted therein. 
Accordingly, this Court should find that Maxwell has waived her privilege claim for every entry 
which describes the subject matter as “Communication re: legal advice,” or at the very least, 
theweig ieiseane Comtnast conduct an in camera inspection of these documents to test the 
propriety of a claim of privilege where no attorney is part of the communication and the privilege log 
description does not provide adequate detail. See Grinnell Corp. v. ITT Corp., 222 F.R.D. 74, 78 
(S.D.N. Y.2003) (examining privilege log as well as documents themselves in order to determine 
applicability of the privilege); Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. M.E.S., Inc., No. 09—CV-—3312, 2013 WL 
1680684, at *4 (noting that “[i]n camera review is ‘a practice both long-standing and routine in cases 


involving claims of privilege.’ ”) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Mar. 19, 2002 & Aug. 2, 
2002, 318 F.3d 379, 386 (2d Cir.2003)). 


13 


require Maxwell to submit the documents in question for in camera review to determine whether 


they are actually subject to any privilege claim. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should order Ms. Maxwell to produce the 
documents listed in her privilege log, or at the very least, conduct an in camera inspection to 


determine whether or not these documents are privileged under applicable law.’°

'° Ms. Maxwell’s Privilege Log is also incomplete because she has unilaterally, arbitrarily, and 
wrongfully withheld production of responsive documents from a great portion of the Relevant Period, as 
addressed in detail in Ms. Giuffre’s Motion to Compel the Production of Documents Subject to Improper 
Objections. Accordingly, to the extent that Ms. Maxwell claims responsive documents from the remainder 


of the Relevant Period are privileged, she must furnish a revised privilege log bearing description of those 
documents as well.

Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully submit 
this Motion to Compel Production of Documents in Response to Request Nos. 1-39 and to 
Compel Documents Subject to Improper Objections Including Refusals to Produce Documents 
from Highly Relevant Time Periods. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should grant 
Plaintiff's Motion in its entirety. 

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

Plaintiff first served her request for production of documents on defendant on October 27, 
2015. Now, almost four (4) months later, and even after this Court denied defendant’s attempts 
to stay discovery and directed a response, defendant is still refusing to produce highly relevant 
documents. Defendant is attempting to grant herself a de facto stay of discovery, without Court 
approval, by refusing to produce documents or generally comply with a party’s clear and 
unequivocal discovery obligations’. Indeed, in response to thirty-eight (38) requests for 
production, the defendant has chosen to produce two emails.’ This represents a willful disregard 
of her discovery obligations, something this Court should not condone. 

“Although not unlimited, relevance, for purposes of discovery, is an extremely broad 
concept.” Ottoson v. SMBC Leasing and Finance, Inc., (Sweet, J.) 2015 WL 4597542 at * 2 
(S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2015) (granting motion to compel) (internal quotations omitted); Stinson v. 
City of New York, (Sweet, J.), 2015 WL 4610422 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2015) (granting in part 
motion to compel production). 

In the Second Circuit, courts have dismissed actions where a party has demonstrated 


willful disregard for its discovery obligations. Edwards v. Am. Airlines, Inc., No. 95 CIV. 5356 


' Maxwell also waited four (4) months to produce her initial Rule 26 Disclosures which she just served on February 
24, 2016. 


* Notably, Maxwell even refuses to produce the defamatory press releases from her communications with her press 
agent Ross Gow, which are at the heart of this case. 


(SAS), 1996 WL 432472, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 1996). See also International Mining Co., 
Inc. v. Allen and Co., (Sweet, J.), 567 F.Supp 777 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (failure to produce 
documents and supply adequate answers to interrogatories without justifiable excuse warranted 
the dismissal of the complaint). The blatant nature of the defendant’s failure to participate in 
discovery is akin to the conduct for which the Second Circuit has awarded sanctions. 

This case turns on whether or not Maxwell defamed Ms. Giuffre when she called Ms. 
Giuffre’s account of her sexual abuse “obvious lies.” Ms. Giuffre intends to establish that 
Maxwell’s defamatory statement was untrue, and that Ms. Giuffre was telling the truth. To 
prove the truth of her sexual abuse, Ms. Giuffre seeks discovery of documents evidencing her 
sexual abuse and sexual trafficking by Maxwell and her associates, including convicted sex 
offender Jeffrey Epstein. Therefore, documents evidencing Ms. Giuffre’s encounters with 
Maxwell, and documents evidencing Maxwell’s communications with her co-conspirators, are 
plainly relevant and discoverable. For example, Request 6 seeks documents relating to 
Maxwell’s communications with Sarah Kellen. Ata prior deposition, Sarah Kellen invoked her 
Fifth Amendment privilege when asked: 


Q. Would you agree with me that Ghislaine Maxwell provides underage girls to Mr. 
Epstein for sex? 

28 2K 

A. Upon the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. 

Q. Take a look at what we marked as Exhibit 10. Do you recognize the two people in 
that photograph? 

A. On the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. 

Q. Would you agree with me that’s Ghislaine Maxwell on the right and Jeffrey Epstein 
on the left? 

A. On the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. 

28 2K 

Q. Do you recognize the young lady shown in Exhibit 11? 

A. On the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. 

Q. Do you agree with me that the young girl shown in Exhibit 11 was recruited by 
Ghislaine Mawell for sexual activity with Jeffrey Esptein? 

A. On the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. 


See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, March 24, 2010 Deposition Transcript of Sarah Kellen at 100- 
103. 

Clearly, communications Maxwell had with Sarah Kellen are highly relevant to 
establishing Maxwell’s involvement in trafficking underage girls. Yet, Maxwell is refusing to 
produce any communications with Sarah Kellen. 

Moreover, defendant Maxwell has admitted that non-privileged,* relevant documents 
exist. She is simply refusing to produce them. See Declaration of Sigrid McCawley 
(“McCawley Decl.”) at Exhibit 2, Defendant Maxwell’s Response to Plaintiff's First Request for 
Production Requests Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 32, 33, 34, and 37. 
Indeed, it is undisputed that Maxwell spent many years traveling with Ms. Giuffre. And, for 
years thereafter, Maxwell continued her association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
Ms. Giuffre is entitled to those documents in discovery because they go directly to the claim at 
issue in this litigation. Therefore, this Court should compel her to produce them. 

IL. LEGAL ARGUMENT 

A. Legal Standard 

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34(a), a party may request that another party 
produce documents in its possession as long as the documents are within the scope of Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 26(b), which allows for broad discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is 
relevant to any party’s claim or defense. Information within this scope of discovery need not be 
admissible in evidence to be discoverable. Relevance is still to be “construed broadly to 
encompass any matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter that could bear 
on” any party's claim or defense. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Fayda, No. 


> Ms. Maxwell’s privilege claims all fail as addressed in Ms. Giuffre’s Motion to Compel Production 
Based on Improper Claim of Privilege. 


14CIV9792WHPICF, 2015 WL 7871037, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2015) (granting motion to 
compel). If the opposing party objects to producing the documents, the party seeking production 
can file a motion to compel with the court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37. Against this backdrop 
of broad discovery rights, Maxwell has refused to produce responsive documents. 

B. Maxwell’s General Objections Fail 

The centerpiece of Maxwell’s general objections is her disingenuous limitation of her 
discovery responses to a short window of time that she has unilaterally selected. Maxwell 
wrongfully attempts to limit discovery to the month of December 30, 2014 — January 31, 2015 
when her defamatory statement was issued and 1999 — 2002*. Maxwell’s time period limitation 
clearly violates both the letter and spirit of Rule 26. For example, a communication by 
Maxwell’s press agent regarding the plaintiff is just as relevant if it was made on February 1, 
2015 as the one that was made on January 3, 2015 and it is clearly discoverable. These 
communications with her press agent are key documents in this case, as the sole claim concerns 
Ms. Maxwell defaming Ms. Giuffre in the press, yet Maxwell has arbitrarily refused to produce 
highly relevant discovery. 

The abuse at issue in this case is alleged to have started in or around 1999 and there are 
relevant documents and communications from that point to the present in that Maxwell 
continued to associate with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein up until at least 2015 as 
evidenced by her privilege log. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Maxwell’s Privilege Log. 
Accordingly, plaintiff defined the relevant period for purposes of her requests for production as 
1999 — present. While that may seem like a substantial period of time, all of the publically 
* Maxwell refers to her shortened time period as “the Relevant Time Period as defined in Paragraph 15” 
of her objections. To be clear, Ms. Giuffre’s references herein to production for the “Relevant Time 


Period” refer to the Relevant Time Period of 1999 to the present as defined in her original requests for 
production. 


available documents demonstrate that the whole period is highly relevant to the sexual abuse 
allegations. For example, the flight logs demonstrate that Maxwell was flying on Jeffrey 
Epstein’s planes over 360 times from 1999 — 2005. In addition, Maxwell flew with plaintiff 
when she was a minor child in 2000 on Jeffrey Epstein’s planes. The flight logs reveal that 
Maxwell continued to actively travel with Jeffrey Epstein and other unidentified “female” 
passengers through at least as late as September 5, 2005.° See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4. 

Moreover, there is critical activity relevant to the abuse allegations happening in the mid- 
2000s as evidenced by the Palm Beach Police report that identified over 30 underage girls who 
were being victimized during that time period. In addition, house staff identifies Maxwell as the 
person in charge during this time period. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 5, Alfredo Rodriguez 
Deposition Transcript at 24-25. 

The years of the mid to late 2000s are also highly relevant because that is during the time 
when convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein entered his plea deal with the government. Law 
enforcement conducted a trash pull from Jeffrey Epstein’s residence in Florida and uncovered his 
house message pads. The message pads reveal that in 2004, Maxwell was coordinating 
“training” with underage girls as indicated by the redactions in the message pads. See 
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, SAO 2830. Maxwell was also organizing “massages” for Epstein 
in 2004 with underage girls and indicating which girls she had lined-up on given days. See 
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, SAO 02841. 

Plaintiff here received a Victim Notification Letter on September 9, 2008. See 


McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 7. In 2009, an attorney sought Maxwell’s deposition in connection 


° Only a fraction of the flight logs were made publically available. Therefore there are likely other records 
in Maxwell’s possession, custody and control that would demonstrate Maxwell traveling with underage 
females but to date she has refused to produce this information and indeed is limiting her responses to a 
very narrow window of time. 


with various sexual abuse allegations and Maxwell dodged the deposition claiming that her 
mother was ill and she would be traveling outside the country with no plans of returning. 
Despite this claim to avoid her deposition, she then was photographed thereafter at Chelsea 
Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, New York. See McCawley Decl. at Composite Exhibit 8 
Maxwell Deposition Notice; Subpoena and Cancellation Payment Notice, and January 13, 2015 
Daily Mail Article with photograph. In 2011, Maxwell started issuing press statements through 
her agent Ross Gow. The offending defamatory statement was issued on January 3, 2015. As 
demonstrated by the timeline, discussed above, any documents that Maxwell has from the period 
from 1999 to the present are highly relevant. Ms. Giuffre respectfully requests that this Court 
direct Maxwell to produce all responsive documents for the time period from 1999 to the 
present.° 

Defendant Maxwell has also asserted fundamentally improper general objections which 
should be overruled. Am. Rock Salt Co., LLC v. Norfolk S. Corp., 228 F.R.D. 426, 432 
(W.D.N.Y. 2004) (“generalized objections that discovery requests are vague, overly broad, or 
unduly burdensome are not acceptable, and will be overruled.”). 

Maxwell’s general objection to producing material that implicates “privacy interests” is 
equally misplaced. Maxwell does not have a “privacy interest” in the illegal sexual abuse and 
trafficking of Ms. Giuffre and other minors, nor does she have a “privacy interest” in the 


communications with her co-conspirators, including convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein and 


° Maxwell has asserted that she cannot find documents for Requests Nos.1, 2, 6, 12, 13, 14, 35 and 38. 
The Requests are set forth in Appendix A. To the extent that these requests incorporate her General 
Objection to the Relevant Period articulated in paragraph 15 of her Objections, Plaintiff requests that this 
Court require Ms. Maxwell to search for and produce any responsive documents from the 1999 to the 
present that may have been excluded from Maxwell’s original search for the reasons stated above. 


others.’ See Zorn v. Howe, 276 A.D.2d 51, 57, 716 N.Y.S.2d 128, 133 (2000) (finding no 
legitimate privacy interest in illegal activity). Unsurprisingly, Maxwell cites no authority that 
would shield the production of those documents.* These documents are responsive and relevant. 
The only proper objection Maxwell can make is an assertion of her Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Failing that assertion, she must produce them. 

Furthermore, Maxwell claims that “prior to this litigation” she has “long had a practice of 
deleting emails after they have been read.” First, Ms. Giuffre is entitled to a forensic examination 
of Maxwell’s personal computers and devices to recover deleted emails and to discovery when 
and if Maxwell has performed a “swipe” of her computers/devices to permanently destroy 
deleted emails. 

Second, in her Motion to Dismiss, Maxwell claims that in both 2011 and 2015 she 
anticipated litigation against tabloids. Specifically, she stated that in 2011, “litigation . . . was 
forthcoming,” and in 2015, she made her press release “’ pertinent to’ anticipated good-faith 
litigation.” When litigation is anticipated, it is incumbent on the party to preserve documents. 

See Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212, 218 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (“Once a party 
reasonably anticipates litigation, it must ... ensure the preservation of relevant documents.”’) 
Additionally, if Maxwell purposefully destroyed documents in 2015, this Court can instruct the 


jury to made an adverse inference against Maxwell or enter a default judgment in favor of Ms. 


7 Non-attorney Maxwell claims that her communications with co-conspirator, convicted pedophile, and 
non-attorney Jeffrey Epstein are privileged, a specious claim that is challenged in Plaintiff's Motion to 
Compel for Improper Assertion of Privilege. 


* Maxwell cites a non-controlling and inapposite Colorado case. In Gateway, the moving party sought to 
inspect personal computers, smartphones, and other devices belonging to the defendant and his wife, who 
was a non-party to the case. The court remanded the decision on the motion to compel that discovery to 
the trial court, requiring that the trial court make findings of fact balancing the defendants’ privacy 
interest with the plaintiffs’ need for the information sought as required by another case. It did not hold 
that such materials were not discoverable. Notably, Maxwell does not cite to any New York case in 
opposing this request, nor does she cite to a case from any other jurisdiction that is at all on point. 


Giuffre. See Rule 37(e)(2)(b),(c), Fed. R. Civ. P. (“If electronically stored information that 
should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party 
failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through 
additional discovery, the court . . . upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive 
another party of the information’s use in the litigation may . . . instruct the jury that it may or 
must presume the information was unfavorable to the party; or dismiss the action or enter a 
default judgment.”) Similarly, Maxwell was served with a subpoena decus tecum on September 
21, 2009 seeking her testimony in relations to Epstein’s underage sex ring. See McCawley Decl. 
at Composite Exhibit 8, 2009 Subpoena issued to Maxwell. Maxwell avoided that deposition by 
falsely claiming to be out of the country (she was, instead, photographed at Chelsey Clinton’s 
New York wedding). See Composite Exhibit 8. Pursuant to that subpoena, Maxwell was placed 
on notice that her documents were relevant to pending litigation. All of these events triggering 
her duty to preserve documents center on Maxwell’s role in Epstein’s sex crimes; therefore, all 
of the documents she had a duty to preserve are relevant to this litigation. Defendant Maxwell 
must produce these documents or explain to the Court when and why they were destroyed. 


C. Maxwell’s Specific Objections Fail 


1. Request No. 1: All documents relating to communications with Jeffery 
Epstein from 1999 — Present. 


a. Maxwell’s Response: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad and unduly 
burdensome and calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not 
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Maxwell further objects 
to this Request to the extent it seeks documents or information protected by the attorney/client 
privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common interest privilege or any other applicable 
privilege. 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell is withholding documents 
outside of the Relevant Periods described in paragraph15, supra’, and is withholding production 
of documents that are privileged pursuant to a common interest agreement. 


b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 
Maxwell must produce documents for the entire Relevant Period as discussed above. 
Communications with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for whom Defendant Maxwell is 
alleged to have assisted him with his sexual trafficking activities are of the highest relevance in 
this case, and must be produced. Additionally, Maxwell has asserted an improper privilege with 
regard to these documents, which is addressed fully in Plaintiff's Motion to Compel for Improper 
Claims of Privilege. 


2. Request No. 3: All documents relating to communications with Andrew 
Albert Christian Edward, Duke of York (a.k.a. Prince Andrew) from 1999 — present. 


a. | Maxwell’s Response: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad and calls for the 
production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to 
the discovery of admissible evidence. Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent it 
seeks documents or information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product 
doctrine, or any other applicable privilege. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it 
implicates her right to privacy. Gateway Logistics, Inc. v. Smay, 302 P .3d 235 (Colo.2013); 
Fed.R.Evid .501. 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell will produce non- 
privileged documents responsive to this Request limited to the Relevant Periods described in 


* Maxwell’s reference to her “redefined” Relevant Period comes from paragraph 15 of her Responses and 
Objections which provides: “Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 1, in particular the definition of the 
“Relevant Period” to include July 1999 to the present, on the grounds that it is overly broad and unduly 
burdensome and calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Complaint at paragraph 9 purports to 
describe events pertaining to Plaintiff and Defendant occurring in the years 1999 — 2002. The Complaint 
also references statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell occurring in January 2015. Defining the “Relevant 
Period” as July 1999 to the present” is vastly overbroad, irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead 
to the discovery of admissible evidence, and as to certain of the Requests, is intended for the improper 
purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell and it implicates her privacy rights. Thus, Ms. Maxwell 
interprets the Relevant Period to be limited to 1999 — 2002 and December 30, 2014 — January 31, 2015 
and objects to production of any documents outside that period, except as specifically noted.” 


paragraph15, supra, and with private phone numbers and related information redacted. Maxwell 
is withholding production of documents outside of such Relevant Periods. 


b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 


Defendant Maxwell’s communications with Prince Andrew, for the entire Relevant 
Period, are relevant to this litigation. Maxwell is alleged to have trafficked Ms. Giuffre to Prince 
Andrew when Ms. Giuffre was a minor. Indeed, there is photographic evidence of Prince 
Andrew with his arm around Virginia’s waist, standing next to Maxwell, in Maxwell’s London 
residence, when Virginia was a minor child. In the one email defendant did produce in Response 
to the Requests for Production, Maxwell instructs Prince Andrew to “call me” after Prince 
Andrew says he needs to speak about Virginia. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 9. Ms. Giuffre is 
entitled to all of the communications between Maxwell and Prince Andrew not only to show the 
communications between them regarding her trafficking, but also possible communications 
between them, that would establish Maxwell furnishing him with other females or discussing 
other individuals who may have been involved with this activity. 

3. Request No. 6: All documents relating to communications with any of the 
following individuals from 1999 — present: Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Eva Dubin, Glen Dubin, 
Jean Luc Brunel, and Nadia Marcinkova. 

a. Maxwell’s Response: 

Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request on the grounds that it calls for the production of 
documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery 
of admissible evidence. 

Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell is withholding production 
of documents relating to communications with Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen and Eva Dubin 
that are outside of the Relevant Periods described in paragraph15, supra. Maxwell has been 
unable to locate any such documents relating to Ms. Marcinkova, Ms. Kellen or Ms. Dubin 
within the Relevant Periods. Maxwell also has been unable to locate any such documents 


responsive to this Request relating to Glen Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel or Emmy Taylor for any time 
period.

b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 
Ms. Kellen was previously deposed regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s underage sex ring. When 
asked about Maxwell’s involvement in the sex trafficking, Ms. Kellen asserted her Fifth 
Amendment privileges and refused to answer. Ms. Kellen’s assertion implicates Maxwell in the 
sex trafficking activity. 


Q. Would you agree with me that Ghislaine Maxwell provides underage girls to Mr. 


Epstein for sex? 
28 2K 


A. Upon the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, March 24, 2010 Deposition Transcript of Sarah Kellen at 100- 
103. 

Maxwell’s communications with Ms. Kellen, at any time during the original Relevant 
Period, are relevant to the sexual abuse suffered by Ms. Giuffre and others at the hands of 
Maxwell, and should not be withheld. Moreover, flight logs demonstrate that Sarah Kellen and 
Maxwell flew together multiple times, including with Ms. Giuffre. See McCawley Decl. at 
Exhibit 4. 

Similarly, Nadia Marcinkova was a co-conspirator of Maxwell and Epstein, and 
communicated with them frequently as evidenced by the message pads law enforcement 
retrieved from Epstein’s residence. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6. Nadia Marcinkova also 
travelled on Jeffrey Epstein’s planes with Maxwell. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4, flight 
logs. Similarly, Emmy Taylor was Maxwell’s assistant during this time frame and also travelled 
on Jeffrey Epstein’s planes with Ms. Giuffre. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4. These 
communications are relevant for the entire original Relevant Period and Maxwell must produce 


them. 


11 


Regarding Glen and Eva Dubin, flight logs demonstrate that they also travelled on Jeffrey 
Epstein’s planes with Maxwell. Maxwell has acknowledged having communications with Eva 
Dubin, but she is refusing to turn them over. Eva and Glen regularly placed calls to Jeffrey 
Epstein and to Maxwell as evidenced by the police report trash pull of message pads. See 
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, SAO2843, SAO2984, SAO2994, SAO3004, SAO3006, and 
SAO3009. Maxwell’s communications with Glen and Eva Dubin are relevant for the entire 
original Relevant Period and should be produced. 


4. Request No. 7: All video tapes, audio tapes, photographs or any other print or 
electronic media relating to females under the age of 18 from the period of 1999 — present. 


a. Maxwell’s Response: 

Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request on the grounds that it calls for the production of 
documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery 
of admissible evidence. 

Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell has been unable to locate 
any documents responsive to this Request which relate or pertain to Plaintiff or any of the 
witnesses identified by Plaintiff in her Rule 26 disclosures. Maxwell is withholding production 
of other documents responsive to this Request, including things like mainstream newspapers, 
magazines, videos, DVDs or other media or family photographs which contain depictions of 
female children, including Maxwell herself as a child. 

b. |Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 

To clarify, Ms. Giuffre is not seeking the depictions of children under the age of 18 that 
that include Maxwell as a child or Maxwell’s relatives as children. Nor is Ms. Giuffre seeking 
mainstream images that are legally available, such as in mainstream newspapers, magazines, 
videos, or DVDs. Instead, Ms. Giuffre is seeking the depictions of underage girls possessed by 
Maxwell. For example, Alfredo Rodriguez, a former household manager for Epstein, testified 


that Maxwell kept images of naked girls on her personal computer whose identities are unknown 


to Ms. Giuffre: 


12 


Q. “Did they appear to be doing any sexual? 

A. Yes, ma’am 

Q. And in these instances were there girls doing sexual things with other girls? 
A. Yes, ma’am. 

Q. And I’m still talking about the pictures on Maxwell’s computer. 

A. Yes, ma’am.” 


See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 5, Alfredo Rodriguez August 7, 2009, Dep. Tr. at 311-312. 
Accordingly, Maxwell’s depictions of females under the age of 18, goes to Ms. Giuffre’s claims 
of sexual abuse and should be produced for the entire original Relevant Period. These pictures 
would reveal which underage girls Maxwell was interacting with and photographing or 
videotaping which is highly relevant to this case. Importantly, this request is not limited to 
depictions of Ms. Giuffre or the individuals in Ms. Giuffre’s Rule 26 disclosures, as Maxwell 
tries to assert in her Objection. 


5. | Request Nos. 8 and 33: All documents relating to your travel from the period 
of 1999 — present, including but not limited to, any travel on Jeffrey Epstein’s planes, 
commercial flights, helicopters, passport records, records indicating passengers traveling with 
you, hotel records, and credit card receipts. 


a. Maxwell’s Response: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request on the grounds that it calls for the production of 
documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery 
of admissible evidence. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it implicates her right 
to privacy. Gateway Logistics, Inc. v. Smay, 302 P .3d 235 (Colo.2013); Fed.R.Evid. 501. 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell is withholding production 
of documents outside of the Relevant Periods described in paragraph15, supra, and is 
withholding documents within the Relevant Period that are private and are not reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The documents reflecting flight plans 
in Maxwell’s possession do not identify passengers or manifests. 


b. Request No. 33 
All travel records between 1999 and the present reflecting your presence in: (a) Palm Beach 


Florida or immediately surrounding areas; (b) 9 E. 71“ Street, New York, NY 10021; (c) New 
Mexico; (d) U.S. Virgin Islands; (e) any jet or aircraft owned or controlled by Jeffrey Epstein. 


13 


c. | Maxwell’s Response to Request No. 33 

Ms. Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome an/or proponed for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. This 
request is also duplicative and cumulative of Requests Nos. 8 and 14 above. Maxwell further 
objects to this Request to the extent that it calls for the production of documents that are 
irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible 
evidence. 

Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell has been unable to locate 
any documents responsive to this Request for the Relevant Periods as defined in paragraph 15, 
supra. Maxwell is withholding production of documents outside of such Relevant Period. 


d. Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 


Popularly known in mainstream media as the “Lolita Express,” "” 


Epstein is alleged to 
have used his private plane to traffic females across state lines for sexual purposes. The 
flightlogs available at this time to Ms. Giuffre only show a fraction of the flights made by the 
Lolita Express, but even those logs show Maxwell and Ms. Giuffre on these flights multiple 
times. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4. This request concerning Maxwell’s travel will show 
Maxwell’s involvement in the trafficking, including Ms. Giuffre, across state lines with and for 
Epstein. 

Jeffrey Epstein’s private island is only reachable by helicopter or boat. Maxwell was 
known to fly the helicopter to the private island transporting guests. Therefore, her helicopter 
flight records will show which girls and other individuals that Maxwell flew to Epstein’s private 
island. The records will also demonstrate when and how many times Maxwell was operating the 
helicopter. 


Maxwell’s commercial flight, passport, hotel, and credit card records are highly relevant 


because they will show, for example, that she flew to Paris, France with Ms. Giuffre while Ms. 


'° See, e.g., “All aboard the ‘Lolita Express’: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2922773/Newly-released-

s-Lolita-Express-private-jet-anonymous-women.html. 








14 


Giuffre was a minor child. Additionally, these records will place Maxwell at other locations 
around the United States and internationally at the same times Ms. Giuffre was in those 
locations, which goes to the defamation claim in this case. The records will also link her to other 
females who may have been trafficked for sex. Finally, Maxwell’s travel to Epstein’s residences 
in Florida, New York, New Mexico, and USVI will support the allegations that Maxwell assisted 
Jeffrey Epstein with his sexual trafficking operation. Accordingly, this is an improper objection. 
Defendant Maxwell has admitted that she is withholding responsive documents from production, 


and this Court should require her to produce them. 


6. Request Nos. 10 and 11: 


a. Request No. 10: All documents relating to payments made from 
Jeffrey Epstein or any related entity to you from 1999 — present, including payments for work 
performed, gifts, real estate purchases, living expenses, and payments to your charitable 
endeavors including the TerraMar project. 


b. |Maxwell’s Response to Request No. 10: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request on the grounds that it calls for the production of 
documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery 
of admissible evidence. 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell has been unable to 
locate any documents responsive to this Request during the Relevant Periods as defined in 
paragraph15, supra. Maxwell is withholding production of documents outside of such 
Relevant Periods. 


c. Request No. 11: All documents relating to or describing any work 
you performed with Jeffrey Epstein, or any affiliated entity from 1999 —present. 


d. Maxwell’s Response to Request No. 11: 


Maxwell objects to this Request in that the terms “work,” “with” and “affiliated entity” 
are vague, undefined and susceptible of multiple meanings and definitions. M. Maxwell objects 
to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly burdensome and/or propounded for 
the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. Maxwell further objects to this Request 
on the grounds that it calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and 
not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 


15 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell has been unable to 
locate any documents responsive to this Request during the Relevant Periods as defined in 
paragraph15, supra. Maxwell is withholding production of documents outside of such 
Relevant Periods. 


e. Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 


Maxwell recruited Ms. Giuffre and groomed her to perform sexual acts for Jeffrey 
Epstein. She also performed other services for Jeffrey Epstein, including recruiting and 
scheduling girls to perform “massages” for Epstein. The household staff testified that they took 
instructions from Maxwell. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 5, Rodriguez at 24-25. Therefore, 
her work for Epstein and related entities is relevant. Discovery concerning Maxwell’s 
compensation, formal or informal, for the work she performed for convicted sex offender Jeffrey 
Epstein is highly relevant for the entire Relevant Period, from 1999 to the present, because 
Maxwell performed these services, and received compensation and gifts during this entire time 
period. For example, a 2003 Vanity Fair article, written before the Jeffrey Epstein scandal 
broke, describes Maxwell as someone who “seems to organize much of [Epstein’s] life -- 
recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a California-based yoga instructor for 


him soll 


The police records also reveal that Maxwell recruited a female to work for Jeffrey 
Epstein. The message pads also reveal Maxwell regularly working for Jeffrey Epstein, including 
organizing his schedule for training underage girls. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, SAO2830. 
The work she performed for Epstein, and the compensation she received, is relevant to the claim 
in this case for the entire Relevant Period. Therefore, Maxwell must produce the documents she 
is withholding. 

Ts Request No. 15: All video tapes, audio tapes, photographs or any other print 


or electronic media taken at a time when you were in Jeffrey Esptein’s company or inside any of 
his residences or aircraft.

a. | Maxwell’s Response: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request on the grounds that it calls for the production of 
documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery 
of admissible evidence. Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent it implicates her 
right to privacy. Gateway Logistics, Inc. v. Smay, 302 P .3d 235 (Colo.2013); Fed.R.Evid . 501. 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell has been unable to locate 
any documents responsive to this Request that are within the Relevant Periods described in 
paragraph15, supra. Maxwell is withholding production of documents outside of such Relevant 
Periods. 


b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 
Maxwell must produce these documents for the entire Relevant Period, and not withhold 
any. Photographs and other electronic recordings with Jeffrey Epstein likely contain the image of 
other underage girls or trafficked women, and therefore, those photographs go to the claim in this 
case. Additionally, such depictions would reveal other potential witnesses in this case. 
Accordingly, Maxwell must not withhold these documents based on her revised time period 
limitation for discovery. 


8. Request No. 17: All documents relating to communications with you and 
Ross Gow from 2005 — present. 


a. | Maxwell’s Response: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent that it calls for the production of documents 
that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence. Maxwell also objects to this request to the extent it seeks documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the common interest privilege, the work- 
product doctrine, or any other applicable privilege. 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell is withholding documents 
responsive to this Request that are outside of the Relevant Periods defined in paragraph15, supra 
as well as the period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011,and also withholding documents 
within the Relevant Periods that are privileged. Maxwell has been unable to locate any non- 
privileged documents that are within such Relevant Periods. 


17 


b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 


Through her non-attorney’’, public relations professional, Maxwell made a defamatory 
statement to the press, and that statement is the genesis of this defamation lawsuit. The press 
quoted portions of this defamatory statement in its publications. The full statement, distributed to 
the press by Maxwell, through her agent Ross Gow, is clearly discoverable. Ms. Maxwell is in 
possession of that full statement. Ms. Maxwell admitted to having a January 2, 2015 “Email from 
Ross Gow to various news organizations,” “Subject: ‘Ghislaine Maxwell.” Its date is the day 
before the known defamatory statements appeared in the press. It is clear that the full defamatory 
statement is contained within that January 2, 2015 email; it is increasingly clear that the full 
statement contains other defamatory remarks, which is why Ms. Maxwell is trying to hide it. 

There are no privileges that attach to emails to the press or to press releases - their very 
purpose is wide dissemination. The fact that Maxwell has not disclosed this press release places 
her in clear violation of her discovery obligations: Ms. Giuffre is plainly entitled to the 
defamatory statement Maxwell released to the press upon which this lawsuit is based, including 
all communications with her press agent, and made by her press agent. Ms. Giuffre presumes that 
the full statement contains additional defamatory statements, which would explain Maxwell’s 
spurious attempt to circumvent her discovery obligations by trying to convince the Court that a 
press release is somehow confidential and privileged. 

In addition to the full statement released to the press, Ms. Giuffre is entitled to all 


previous drafts of the statement, and all communications Maxwell had with Mr. Gow regarding 


'? Ross Gow is not an attorney, and Maxwell has not alleged that he is an attorney. Upon information and 
belief, Ross Gow is merely a public relations professional who works for a PR firm that Maxwell 
employed. As a non-attorney, no attorney-client privilege attaches to Maxwell and Gow’s 
communications. Maxwell’s communications with Gow listed on the Maxwell privilege log are 
challenged in Plaintiff's Motion to Compel for Improper Claim of Privilege.

the statement. Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre is entitled to communications relating to Mr. Gow - 
particularly the January 2, 2015 email - for the entire Relevant Period. 


9. Request No. 21-24: All telephone records associated with you including 
cellphone records from 1999 —present. 


a. | Maxwell’s Response: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome, propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell, and seeks 
documents outside of Maxwell’s possession, custody or control. Maxwell further objects to this 
Request to the extent that it calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action 
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Maxwell further 
objects to this Request to the extent it implicates her right to privacy. Gateway Logistics, Inc. v.

Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell has been unable to locate 
any documents responsive to this Request within the Relevant Periods defined in paragraph15, 


supra. Maxwell is withholding production of documents outside of such Relevant Periods. 


h. Maxwell’s Objections To Requests 21-24 Fail, as the Requests Seek 
Relevant Discovery 


Requests Nos. 21-24 seek Maxwell’s telephone records, Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein’s 
calendars, and Epstein’s contact lists for the Relevant Period. Maxwell admits that she has 
documents responsive to these request that she refuses to produce. Contact with, meetings with, 
and contact information for the Maxwell and Epstein’s underage victims and adult co- 
conspirators will prove that Ms. Giuffre is truthful regarding her sexual abuse. The small 
grouping of message pads pulled by law enforcement reflect that Maxwell was making 
arrangements for Jeffrey Epstein and was in regular and frequent contact with him. See 
SAO2847. Records of telephone calls and meetings are critical to this case. For example, in one 


of the two documents produced by Maxwell, she instructs co-conspirator Prince Andrew to “call 


20 


me.” See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 9. Another example is Jeffrey Epstein’s “black book” with 
the contact information for underage girls and co-conspirators. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 
10. Accordingly, Maxwell’s refusal to produce similar documents is not supported by law, and 
this Court should order them to be produced. Similarly, Maxwell’s and Mr. Epstein’s calendars, 
schedules and appointments reveal who they met with and when, including underage girls and 
co-conspirators. 

Maxwell and Epstein’s illegal and abusive behavior is not only relevant for the period of 
time in which they trafficked Ms. Giuffre: their continued trafficking until Epstein’s 2008 
indictment, and their continued collaboration up through the present regarding the related civil 
suits also go to the claim in this case, and support Ms. Giuffre’s account of her own sex abuse. 
Accordingly, Maxwell must produce the documents responsive to these four requests that she is 
withholding. 


10. Request No. 32: All documents related to communications with or 
interaction with Alan Dershowitz from 1999 to present. 


a. | Maxwell’s Response: 


Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent that it calls for the production of documents 
that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence. Maxwell further objects to this Request as being interposed for an improper 
purpose, specifically Plaintiff and her counsel’s civil litigation currently pending in Broward 
County, Florida in the matter of Cassell v. Dershowitz. 


Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell will produce non- 
privileged documents responsive to this Request during the Relevant Periods defined in 
paragraph15, supra. Maxwell is withholding production of documents outside of such Relevant 
Periods. 

b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 


Defendant Maxwell has been communicating with Alan Dershowitz about the sexual 


trafficking allegations as evidenced by the one email she produced. Maxwell’s communications 


21 


with Dershowitz are directly relevant to the claim. Maxwell has admitted that she has documents 
responsive to this request,'* but refuses to produce them under her arbitrary and self-serving 
restrictive limitation to the Relevant Period. Accordingly, this Court should require that 
Defendant Maxwell produce her communications with Dershowitz. 


11. Request No. 34: All documents reflecting your ownership or control of 
property in London between the years 1999 and 2002. 


a. Maxwell’s Response 
Maxwell objects to this Request to the extent that it calls for the production of documents 
that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence. Maxwell further objects to this Request on the grounds that it calls for 


documents that are a matter of public record and are thus equally available to the Plaintiff. 


Subjection to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell is withholding 
documents Responsive to this Request that are a matter of public record. 


b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 

Defendant Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein trafficked Ms. Giuffre when she was a minor 
child to Prince Andrew in Maxwell’s own home in London, as evidenced by the photograph of 
Ms. Giuffre, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew taken in her London home when Ms. Giuffre was 
only seventeen years old. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 11. Evidence of Maxwell’s property in 
London evidences this incident of sexual trafficking, and it is therefore relevant. The ownership 
and property records are also relevant to establish whether any other individuals have ownership 
rights in the property, like Jeffrey Epstein. The recent amendments to Rule 26(b) allow courts to 
take into account “the parties' relative access to relevant information.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). 
Maxwell admitted that she already has responsive documents in her possession that she is 


choosing to withhold, purporting that they are “‘a matter of public record,” without giving any 


'S Alan Dershowitz is not Maxwell’s attorney, and Maxwell has not alleged that he is her attorney. 
Therefore, no attorney-client privilege attaches to Maxwell and Dershowitz’s communications. Maxwell 
has listed communications with Dershowitz on her privilege log. That entry is challenged in Plaintiff's 
Motion to Compel for Improper Claim of Privilege. 


22 


evidence or reasons supporting that statement, nor explaining how and whether such records can 
be accessed by a foreigner. Indeed, Ms. Giuffre’s access to property records in a foreign 
jurisdiction is slight compared to Maxwell’s access to documents already in her possession. The 
party resisting disclosure bears the burden of establishing alternative sources for the information, 
and Maxwell has not met that burden. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Fayda, No. 
14CIV9792WHPIJCF, 2015 WL 7871037, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2015) (internal citations and 
quotations omitted). Accordingly, Maxwell must produce her property records. 

12. Request No. 37: All documents reflecting communications you have had 
with Bill or Hillary Clinton (or persons acting on their behalf), including all communications 
regarding your attendance at Chelsea’s Clinton’s wedding ceremony in 2010. 

a. | Maxwell’s Response: 

Maxwell objects to this Request on the grounds that it is overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Maxwell. 
Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent that it calls for the production of documents 
that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence. 

Subject to and without waiving the above objections, Maxwell has been unable to locate 
any documents responsive to this Request for the Relevant Periods as defined in paragraph 15, 
supra. Maxwell is withholding production of documents outside of such Relevant Periods. 

b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 

As recounted above, in 2009, an attorney sought Maxwell’s deposition in connection with 
various sexual abuse allegations and Maxwell said her mother was ill and she would be traveling 
outside the country with no plans of returning. Despite this claim to avoid her deposition, she 
then was photographed at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, New York. See McCawley 
Decl. at Exhibit 8, Maxwell Deposition Notice; Subpoena and Cancellation Payment Notice, and 
January 13, 2015 Daily Mail Article with photograph. Maxwell admits that she has documents 


responsive to this request, and this Court should require her to produce them. Other 


communications she has had with the Clintons about Ms. Giuffre or the allegations in this case 


23 


are also highly relevant, particularly given that Mr. Clinton travelled with Maxwell, Jeffrey 
Epstein and others on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane a number of times, including a trip to Thailand. 

13. Request No. 39: All documents reflecting training to fly a helicopter or 
experience flying a helicopter, including any records concerning your operation of a helicopter in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

a. | Maxwell’s Response: 
Maxwell objects to this Request to the extent that it calls for the production of documents 
that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of 
admissible evidence. Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent it implicates her right 


to privacy. Gateway Logistics, Inc. v. Smay, 302 P.3d 235 (Colo. 2013); Fed. R. Evid. 501. 


Maxwell is withholding documents responsive to this Request as irrelevant and not 
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 


b. | Maxwell’s Objections Fail, as the Request Seeks Relevant Discovery 

Epstein’s private island in the United States Virgin Islands is only accessible via boat or 
helicopter. Maxwell flew people back and forth from Epstein’s island as part of her sexual 
trafficking of underage girls. Records of Maxwell’s operating a helicopter and training therefor 
is relevant to the claims of sexual abuse in this case. Maxwell has admitted that she has 
responsive documents; therefore, this Court should require her to produce them. 

CONCLUSION 

For the reasons set forth above, plaintiff Virginia Giuffre respectfully requests that the 
Court grant her Motion to Compel and direct Defendant Maxwell to produce documents 
responsive to Request Nos. | — 39 for the period of 1999 to the present.

By: Laura A. Menninger, Esq. 


Sweet, D.J. 


Defendant has moved to dismiss the Plaintiff’s complaint 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) (6). Based on 


the conclusions set forth below, Defendant’s motion is denied. 


I. Prior Proceedings 


Plaintiff filed a complaint in this Court on September 21 
2015, alleging a single defamation claim. See Compl.! Defendant 
sought an extension of her time to answer, move, or otherwise 
respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint to November 30, 2015. The 
request was granted on October 12, 2015. By Order filed October 
30, 2015, the parties were directed to complete fact discovery 


by July 1, 2016, and expert discovery by August 3, 2016. 


On December 1, 2015, Defendant filed the instant motion to 
dismiss and a motion to stay discovery pending a decision on the 
motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for an extension of 
time. Oral argument was held on both motions and the matters 


deemed fully submitted on January 14, 2016. The motion to stay 





‘ 3 : int 

Some paragraph numbering in Plaintiff’s Complaint repeats. Where 
necessary for clarification, citations will reference page numbers 
either in lieu of or addition to paragraph numbering. 


discovery was denied and the motion to extend granted for 


fourteen days by Opinion dated January 19, 2016. 


II. Applicable Standard 


On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b) (6), all 
factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, and 
all inferences are drawn in favor of the pleader. Mills v. 
Polar Molecular Corp., 12 F.3d 1170, 1174 (2d Cir. 1993). A 
complaint must contain “sufficient factual matter, accepted as 
true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its 
face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009) (quoting 
Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 
1964, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible 
when “the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court 
to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct: alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. ab 663: (quoting 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). In other words, the factual 
allegations must “possess enough heft to show that the pleader 
is entitled to relief.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 (internal 


quotation marks omitted). 


Additionally, while “a plaintiff may plead facts alleged 


upon information and belief ‘where the belief is based on 


factual information that makes the inference of culpability 
plausible,’ such allegations must be ‘accompanied by a statement 
of the facts upon which the belief is founded.’” Munoz-Nagel v. 
Guess, Inc., No. 12-1312, 2013 WL 1809772, *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 
2013) (quoting Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 
(2d Cir. 2010)); Prince v. Madison Square Garden, 427 F. Supp. 
2d 372, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); Williams v. Calderoni, No. 11-3020, 
2012 WL 691832, *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2012)). The pleadings, 
however, “must contain something more than . .. a statement of 
facts that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally cognizable 
right of action.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation and 


internal quotation omitted). 


III. The Motion to Dismiss is Denied 


Defendant’s cites four grounds for dismissal: (1) the 
allegedly defamatory statements are protected by the self- 
defense privilege; (2) the allegedly defamatory statements are 
protected by the pre-litigation privilege; (3) the allegedly 
defamatory statements are non-actionable; (4) pleading defects 
in the Complaint, specifically, failure to allege adequate 
identifying details related to the Statements, and failure to 


Plead special damages. Def.’s Mem. in Supp. Mot. Dismiss Compl 


9-25 (“Def.’s MTD”), 


A. The Complaint is Adequately Pled 


At the center of this case is the veracity of a contextual 
world of facts more broad than the allegedly defamatory 
statements. Specifically, as a minor, Plaintiff was a victim of 
sustained underage sexual abuse between 1999 and 2002. Compl. “3= 
6, WI 8-27. Plaintiff has since identified Defendant as closely 
involved in Plaintiff’s trafficking for the purpose of this 
abuse. Id. @%@ 8-10, 13, 17-19, 27. Defendant has responded to 


those allegations, and this case concerns those responses. 


Plaintiff has identified two statements as allegedly 
defamatory. The first is a statement Defendant made through her 
agent on January 3, 2015 (the “January 3 Statement”). Compl. at 
6, @ 29-30. Plaintiff alleges that the content of this statement 
contained actionable falsehoods in stating that Plaintiff’s own 
allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue,” that 
Plaintiff’s allegations have been “shown to be untrue,” and that 
Plaintiff’ s “Claims ape obvious lies. 1d... 30.~The second 
concerns a January 4, 2015 on-camera statement made to the New 
York Daily News (the “January 4 Statement”). LAs Se. Ty ESTs 
Plaintiff alleges that this statement constitutes an actionable 


falsehood by referring back to the January 3 statement in 


response to a question regarding the allegations Plaintiff had 


made against Maxwell. Id. 


Under New York law,2 written defamation constituting 
actionable libel requires Plaintiff to plead: (1) a written 
defamatory statement of fact concerning the plaintiff; (2) 
publication to a third party; (3) fault, either negligence or 
actual malice, depending on the plaintiff’s status; (4) falsity; 
(5) special damages or per se libel. Krepps v. Reiner, 588 F. 
Supp, 2-471; 483. (SvD.NeY~ 2008) att*d, 377 -F. App’ = 65 (2d 


Cir. 2010) (citing Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enters. Inc., 209 





F380 63,  L76> (20-Gir.2000))):. 


Defendant argues that the statements in question are not 


susceptible to a defamatory meaning.? Def.’s MTD at 10-11; Def.’s 


2 Plaintiff is a citizen of Colorado. Compl. 4 7. The statements in 
question were made in New York, Defendant resides in New York, 
Plaintiff has brought suit in New York. Id. 4 7, 29-32, 37. There is 
no conflict between New York and Colorado defamation law. Compare 
Kforce, Inc. v. Alden Personnel, Inc., 288 F. Supp. 2d 513, 516 
(S.D.N.Y. 2003) with Zerr v. Johnson, 894 F. Supp. 374, 376 (D. Colo. 
1995). Because New York has the most significant interest, New York 
law applies. Catalanello v. Kramer, 18 F. Supp. 3d 504, 511 (S.D.N.Y. 
2014). 

> Defendant submits this argument primarily as part of the self-defense 
privilege argument (arguing that Defendant was taking advantage of her 
right to generally deny the claims against her). Def.’s MTD at 10-11. 
Both parties argue this point in the form of supplementary authority. 
See Pl.’s Supp. Auth., filed Jan. 8, 2016; Def.’s Supp. Auth., filed 
Jan. 21, 2016. Because this issue goes to the heart of whether the 
statements Plaintiff identifies as allegedly defamatory can meet the 
pleading requirement of a defamatory statement of fact, it will be 
addressed in this pleading sufficiency Part. 








Reply 1-6; see also Def.’s Supp. Auth. Plaintiff submits that 
Defendant has effectively called her a “liar,” while Defendant 
points out the word “liar” was never used in the statements 
alleged. Pl.’s Opp. at 4-5,10-11; Def.’s Reply at 4. “The 
dispositive inquiry is whether, on the basis of the over-all 
context in which the assertion were made, a reasonable reader 
could have concluded that the statements were conveying facts 
about the plaintiff.” Davis v. Boeheim, 24 N.Y.3d 262, 22 N.E.3d 
999 (2014) (internal citations, ellipses, and brackets omitted). 
The distinction is one between fact and opinion, the latter of 


which is non-actionable. Id. 


In distinguishing between fact and opinion, the Court asks 
“(1) whether the specific language in issue has a precise 
meaning which is readily understood; (2) whether the statements 
are capable of being proved true or false; and (3) whether 
either the full context of the communication in which the 
statement appears or the broader social context and surrounding 
circumstances are such as to signal readers or listeners that 
what is being read or heard is likely to be opinion, not fact.” 
Id. (citations omitted). The Davis court held that to 
“communicate that [sexual assault victims] lied, [and] their 


motive was financial gain” constituted defamatory meaning. Id. 


Courts recently grappling with the distinction between 
actionable defamation and non-actionable protected speech in the 
context of denials of sexual assault claims have come to 
different conclusions. In Green v. Cosby, the Defendant had 
called allegations of sexual assault “nothing” that had “proved 
to be nothing,” and an “absurd fabrication.” No. ue: As Oi mene | 0 al 
(MGM), 2015 WL 5923553, at *3 (D. Mass. Oct. 9, 2015)... In short, 
the Defendant had denied the allegations and, as here, given the 
impression that they were wholly untrue. The court concluded 
that “{gliven the different nature of the [sexual assault] 
allegations in this case and the wording of the [denial] 
response, the court cannot conclude here that, as a matter of 
law, Defendant’s response is incapable of negatively impacting 
Plaintiff Green’s reputation within the community.” Id. at *11. 
Hill v. Cosby involved statements that a sexual assault 
allegations were “unsubstantiated, fantastical stories,” that 
the allegations constituted “innuendos” that ought to have been 
“fact-checkl[ed]” and “vet[ted].”% No. 15 Civ. 1658 (AJS), 2016 WL 
AGIT28,. at *5° {WsD. Pa. 2016)... The Hill court found none of the 


alleged statements defamatory. Id. at *5. 


Hill is distinguishable. Unlike Hill, this case (like 
Green) involves statements that explicitly claim the sexual 


assault allegations are false. Hill concerned statements that 


the sexual assault allegations were unsubstantiated. The 
difference is slight but significant; both true and false 
allegations can be accurately described as unsubstantiated and 
insufficiently vetted. Vetting may make claims more or less 
likely to be true, but lack thereof does not alone establish 
falsity. Conversely, true allegations can never be accurately 
described as “proved to be nothing” or “absurd fabrication” as 


in Green, or “obvious lies” “shown to be untrue.” 


This case therefore requires the same finding as that in 
Davis and Green. First, statements that Giuffre’s claims 
“against [Defendant] are untrue,” have been “shown to be 
untrue,” and are “obvious lies” have a specific and readily 
understood factual meaning: that Giuffre is not telling the 
truth about her history of sexual abuse and Defendant’s role, 
and that some verifiable investigation has occurred and come to 
a definitive conclusion proving that fact. Second, these 
statements (as they themselves allege), are capable of being 
proven true or false, and therefore constitute actionable fact 
and not opinion. Third, in their full context, while Defendant’s 
statements have the effect of generally denying Plaintiff's 


story, they also clearly constitute fact to the reader. 


Though Defendant never éGalled Plaimtif£t a “liar,” to call 
her claims “obvious lies” that “have been shown to be untrue” 
demands the same meaning. Plaintiff cannot be making claims 
shown to be untrue that are obvious lies without being a liar. 
Furthermore, to suggest an individual is not telling the truth 
about her history of having been sexually assaulted as a minor 
constitutes more than a general denial, it alleges something 
deeply disturbing about the character of an individual willing 
to be publicly dishonest about such a reprehensible crime. 
Defendant’s statements clearly imply that the denials are based 
on facts separate and contradictory to those that Plaintiff has 
alleged. Sexual assault of a minor is a clear-cut issue; either 
transgression occurred or it did not. Either Maxwell was 
involved or she was not. The issue is not a matter of opinion, 
and there cannot be differing understandings of the same facts 
that justify diametrically opposed opinion as to whether 
Defendant was involved in Plaintiff’s abuse as Plaintiff has 
claimed. Either Plaintiff is telling the truth about her story 
and Defendant’s involvement, or Defendant is telling the truth 
and she was not involved in the trafficking and ultimate abuse 
of Plaintiff. The answer depends on facts. Defendant’s 
statements are therefore actionable as defamation. Whether they 
ultimately prove to meet the standards of defamation (including 


but not limited to falsity) is a matter for the fact-finder. 


10 


Defendant also argues that the allegedly defamatory 
statements are non-actionable because Plaintiff has “failfled] to 
provide the context within which the Statements were delivered.” 
Def.’s MTD at 18. An allegedly defamatory must be examined in 
“the full context of the communication in which the statement 
appears” and within its broader social context and setting. 
Celle, 209 F.3d at 179. Failure to “provide” context is not 
fatal to Plaintiff’s complaint. Plaintiff has pled the relevant 
elements of the January 3 press release calling Giuffre’s claims 
false constitute defamation, identifying the particular 
defamatory words. Compl. @ 30. Likewise, Plaintiff alleges the 
January 4 statement constitutes defamation by referring back to 
the January 3 statement. Defendant cites dismissals of vague and 
conclusory defamation actions, but these cases are inapposite. 
See Def.’s MTD at 18. Plaintiff’s claims are specific and 
reasoned defamatory on the basis of the history of sexual abuse 
Plaintiff sets forth in her Complaint. See Compl. { 8-28. 


Plaintiff’s claim is therefore sufficient.? 


* Plaintiff further argues that, when considered in context, “it is 
clear that the January 3 Statement was issued in self defense and in 
anticipation of good-faith litigation.” Def.’s MTD at 18. This is not 
a pleading defect argument, but one that goes to the Defendant’s self- 
defense and pre-litigation privilege arguments. The Court will 


therefore address this point in considering Defendant’s privilege 
arguments. 


1i 


With respect to the January 3 Statement, Defendant argues 
that the claim fails for failure to plead “to whom, where, or in 
what manner” the statement was made. Def.’s MTD at 20=1% 
“Failure to state the particular person or persons to whom the 
allegedly slanderous or libelous comments were made as well as 
the time and manner in which the publications were made warrants 
dismissal.” Hawkins v. City of New York, No. 99 Civ. 11704 
(RWS), 2005 WL 1861855, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2005) 
(collecting citations). Each case Defendant cites involved a 
complaint so defective it lacked a claim of particular allegedly 
defamatory words. See id. (“failure to identify to whom the 
statement was allegedly made and the content of that 
statement”); J.P.R. Cafeteria, Inc. v. Kingsborough Cmty. Coll. 
of City Univ..of N.v.- 16 Mise, 3d. 1127 (A)-;; 847 Ns¥.S.2d 902 
(Sup. Ct. 2007) (“[The Complaint] fails to set forth the 
particular words alleged to be defamatory”); Cruz v. Marchetto, 
Now SUE Gack 8370) 2012: Wii4513484,. at *3° (SDN ee -OCEs 2, 20L2) 
(“Here, [Plaintiff] has not pled that [Defendant] published any 
statements to the various media outlets with specificity nor 


demonstrated any fault”). 


Unlike the cases Defendant cites, Plaintiff has alleged 
that the January 3 Statement was made in a press release for 


distribution to the media and the public for the purposes of 


12 


refuting Giuffre’s story regarding her history of sexual abuse. 
See Compl. @ 30. Plaintiff’s Complaint identifies the specific 
allegedly defamatory content by direct quotation. See id. By 
Defendant’s own admission, the January 3 Statement was made to 
media in response to Plaintiff’s publicized sexual abuse 
history. See e.g. Def.’s MTD at 10 (“Each attributed statement 
responds directly to allegations and claims made by 
Plaintiff.”), 17-18 (“The January 3 Statement appears, inter 
alia, in a telegraph [sic] article... [containing] the 
following response by Ms. Maxwell’s spokesman. . . made in 
response to repeated reputation-harming allegations”). 
Plaintiff has sufficiently pled to specificity of the content 


and context of the allegedly defamatory statements. 


Defendant further argues that the January 4 Statement is 
not actionable, as it was a non-substantive response to 
reporters that amounts to a declination to comment. Def.’s MTD 
at 20. Defendant points out the sum total of the interaction and 
statements recorded were as follows: 

Defendant: “I wish you a happy new year and thank you so 


much.” 


Off-Camera Individual 1: “So you’re basically not 
commenting, is that...” 


Defendant: “I’m referring to the statement that was made.” 
Off-Camera Individual 2: “Is any of that true?” 
Defendant: “C’mon, guys...” 


Def.’s MTD at 20.

Plaintiff has pled that the comment “I’m referring to the 
statement that was made” concerns the January 3 Statement, and 
in doing so, reiterates its content. Compl. @ 37. “{I]f, upon 
any reasonable view of the stated facts, plaintiff would be 
entitled to recovery for defamation, the complaint must be 
deemed to sufficiently state a cause of action” that survives a 
motion to dismiss. Davis, 24 N.Y.3d at 268 (collecting 
citations). It is a reasonable reading that in “referring to the 
statement that was made,” Defendant was implying the content of 
the previous day’s press release (particularly in the absence of 
any other “statement that was made”). Whether another listener 
could interpret Defendant’s self-described reference merely as a 
declination to comment does not defeat the fact that Plaintiff’s 


alleged reading is plausible. 


Finally, Defendant argues the Complaint is facially 
defective for failure to plead special damages. Def.’s MTD at 
23. “However, it is well established that compensable injury is 
presumed if the defamatory statement falls within a category of 
libel per sé.” Computech Int’ 1, Ine. v7. Compaw Computer Corp., 
No. 02 Civ. 2628 (RWS), 2004 WL 1126320, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. May 


21, 2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

Libel is “actionable per se if it tends to expose another to 
public hatred, shame, obloquy, contempt, ridicule, aversion, 
ostracism, degradation, or disgrace, or to induce an evil 
opinion of one in the minds of right-thinking persons and to 
deprive one of one’s confidence and friendly intercourse in 
society or tends to disparage a person in the way of his office, 


“a 


profession or trade.” Idema v. Wager, 120 F. Supp. 2d 361, 367 


(S.D.N.Y. 2000) (internal marks and citations omitted). 


Plaintiff has specifically pled libel per se on two 
grounds: First, “Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel per 
se inasmuch as they exposed Giuffre to public contempt, 
ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of 
her in the minds of right-thinking persons.” Compl. at 9, @ 10. 
Second, “Maxwell’s false statements also constitute libel per se 
inasmuch as they tended to injure Giuffre in her professional 
capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed 
to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they 
destroyed her credibility and reputation among members of the 


community that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve.” Id. 


Tid, 


It is plausible that a comment indicating that an 


individual is lying about a history of underage sexual abuse 


15 


tends to expose that individual to public contempt as someone 
willing to lie and accuse others of a truly unfathomable and 
morally disgraceful course of action. Society takes accusations 
of pedophilia and sexual abuse sufficiently seriously that it is 
plausible to allege that to claim an individual has made false 
accusations of underage sex abuse would expose that individual 
to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace in the 


minds of right-thinking persons. 


Furthermore, for an individual acting in the capacity of 
president of a non-profit corporation designed to help victims 
of sex trafficking, publication of a false narrative of sex 
trafficking would tend to disparage that individual in the way 
of her profession. Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff may not 
take advantage of this second ground on the basis that “victim” 
is not a profession ignores the valid profession of non-profit 
advocacy, and the very real importance of perceived competence 


and integrity in the conduct of that profession.® Plaintiff has 


° For example, Somaly Mam, an internationally celebrated anti-sex 
trafficking advocate and head of the Somaly Mam Foundation was accused 
of fabricating her personal story of having been trafficked. Despite 
the irrefutable work of the Foundation on behalf of other victims of 
trafficking, Mam was forced to resign and the Foundation closed as a 
result of the scandal. See Gerhard Joren, Somaly Mam: The Holy Saint 
(and Sinner) of Sex Trafficking, Newsweek, May 14, 2014, available at 
http: //www.newsweek.com/2014/05/30/somal y-mam-holy-saint-and-sinner- 
sex-trafficking-251642.html; see also Taylor Wofford, Somaly Mam

http: //www.newsweek.com/somaly-mam-foundation-closes~278657. 


16 


therefore met her burden of adequately pleading libelous 
statements constituting libel per se on two independent grounds, 
and need not plead special damages. Accordingly, Plaintiff has 


sufficiently pled a claim of defamation. 


B. Defendant’s Intent to Assert Affirmative Privilege 


Defenses Does Not Justify Dismissal 


Defendant argues that the alleged defamatory statements are 
protected by the self-defense and pre-litigation privileges, and 
thus provide grounds to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint. Def.’s 
MID at 7-16. “New York courts have articulated the standard for 
libel and defamation using various terms, not all of which 
explicitly include malice or the requirement that the statement 
in question lack privilege.” Ornstein v. Figel, 677 F. Supp. 2d 
706, Jil (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citations omitted). At least some 
courts require a defamation claim plead lack of privilege. Id. 
(citing Dillon v. City of N.yY., 704 N.Y.S.2d 1, 5 (lst Dep’t 


1999); Roberti v. Schroder Inv. Mgmt. N. Am., Inc., No. 04 Civ. 





2404 (LTS) (THK), 2006 WL 647718, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 14, 2006) 
(citing Peters v. Baldwin Union Free Sch. Dist., 320 F.3d 164, 


L166 (200Cir. 2003) y-. 


17 


Defendant acknowledges that these privileges are, even if 
applicable, qualified. Def.’s MTD at 8 (“New York. 
recognizes a qualified privilege to respond in self-defense”) 


(citing Kane v. Orange Cty. Publications, 232 A.D.2d 526, 527, 





649 N.Y.S.2d 23 (1996) (citations omitted) (stating “response to 
unfavorable publicity against [the defendant is] covered by a 
qualified privilege”); Id. at 13 (“Statements made by attorneys 
and parties pertinent to good faith anticipated litigation are 


conditionally privileged.”). 


“Qualified privilege is an affirmative defense that must be 


pleaded and proved by the defendant.” Kroemer v. Tantillo, 270 





A.D.2Zd 810, 810, 706 N.Y.S.2d 538, 539 (2000). Plaintifi also 
has a right to rebut the privilege or show it was lost. The 
affirmative privilege defenses are therefore not appropriate for 
resolution on a motion to dismiss. Roberti, 2006 WL 647718, at 
*8 (“Defendant's alternative argument that it is entitled to 
dismissal of the defamation claim on qualified privilege grounds 
must also be rejected at this stage of the litigation” because 


“a claim of qualified privilege may be rebutted”). 


Moreover, to the extent the privileges do apply or lack of 
privilege is a requisite element of Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff 


has met her burden by pleading facts supporting a plausible 


18 


conclusion that the privileges may be rebutted. “Under New York 
law, a qualified or conditional privilege may exist where 
statements are made, without malice, in furtherance of a common 
interest.” Block v. First Blood Assoc., 691 F. Supp. 685, 699 
(S.D.N.Y. 1988) (citing Loughry v. Lincoin First Bank, N.A., 67 
N.Y¥.2d 369, 502 N.Y.S.2d 965, 494 N.E.2d 70 (1986)). “There is 
no qualified privilege under New York law when such statements 
are spoken with malice, knowledge of their falsity, or reckless 


disregard for their truth.” Id. 


Plaintiff has repeatedly pled that the January 3 and 4 
Statement were made with malice and knowledge of their falsity. 
Compl. at 9, 4 10; 10, @ 17. The Complaint pleads adequate facts 
to support these conclusions. See Compl. at 3-7. Specifically, 
Plaintiff has pled that Maxwell assisted and participated in 
Giuffre’s trafficking and ultimate abuse. See id. Taking these 
facts to be true as the Court must, it is a logically necessary 
conclusion that Maxwell’s denial of this story would be made 
with knowledge of falsity; Maxwell could not have participated 


for the purpose of Plaintiff’s trafficking and falsely deny that 


19 


fact without knowledge of falsity.® Plaintiff has therefore pled 
sufficient facts to show a plausible defeat of any qualified 


privilege defense. 


IV. Conclusion 


For the foregoing reasons and as set forth above, Defend- 


ant'’s motion to dismiss is denied. 


It is so ordered. )

DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR A PROTECTIVE ORDER 


Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through undersigned counsel, moves this Court for the 
entry of a Protective Order pursuant to Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In 
support of this motion, Ms. Maxwell states as follows: 

Pursuant to F.R.C.P. 26(c) this Court “may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a 
party...from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense...” The nature 
of this case concerns highly personal and sensitive information from both parties. In this action, 
both parties have sought and will seek confidential information in the course of discovery from 
the other party and from non-party witnesses. Release of such confidential information outside 
of the litigation could expose the parties to “annoyance, embarrassment, [and] oppression” and 
result in significant injury to one or more of the parties’ business or privacy interests. 

Plaintiff seeks to take the deposition of defendant Ghislaine Maxwell. Based on written 
discovery requests served to date, it is anticipated that Plaintiff will seek to question Ms. 


Maxwell concerning her personal and professional relationships as well matters concerning her 


private affairs. Furthermore, Plaintiff has served Ms. Maxwell with document requests that seek 


information of a sensitive and confidential nature. Dissemination of such information to third 


parties could be significantly harmful to Ms. Maxwell’s business and personal privacy interests. 


Good cause exists for entry of this Protective Order. 


WHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion for 


Protective Order in this matter in the form attached as Exhibit A to Declaration of Laura 


Menninger in Support of Defendant’s Motion for a Protective Order.

PROTECTIVE ORDER 


Upon a showing of good cause in support of the entry of a protective order to 
protect the discovery and dissemination of confidential information or information which 
will improperly annoy, embarrass, or oppress any party, witness, or person providing 
discovery in this case, IT IS ORDERED: 

1. This Protective Order shall apply to all documents, materials, and information, 
including without limitation, documents produced, answers to interrogatories, 
responses to requests for admission, deposition testimony, and _ other 
information disclosed pursuant to the disclosure or discovery duties created by 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 

2, As used in this Protective Order, “document” is defined as provided in 
FED.R.CIV.P. 34(a). A draft or non-identical copy is a separate document 


within the meaning of this term. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 39-1 Filed 03/02/16 Page 3 of 7 


Information designated “CONFIDENTIAL” shall be information that is 
confidential and implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of (a) 
plaintiff Virginia Roberts Giuffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine Maxwell. 
CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose 
except the preparation and trial of this case. 

CONFIDENTIAL documents, materials, and/or information (collectively 

“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION’) shall not, without the consent of the 

party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed except that such 

information may be disclosed to: 

a. attorneys actively working on this case; 

b. persons regularly employed or associated with the attorneys actively 
working on this case whose assistance is required by said attorneys in the 
preparation for trial, at trial, or at other proceedings in this case; 

c. the parties; 

d. expert witnesses and consultants retained in connection with this 
proceeding, to the extent such disclosure is necessary for preparation, trial 
or other proceedings in this case; 

e. the Court and its employees (“Court Personnel’) in this case; 

f. stenographic reporters who are engaged in proceedings necessarily incident 
to the conduct of this action; 


g. deponents, witnesses, or potential witnesses; and 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 39-1 Filed 03/02/16 Page 4 of 7 


h. other persons by written agreement of the parties. 

Prior to disclosing any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any person 
listed above (other than counsel, persons employed by counsel, Court 
Personnel and stenographic reporters), counsel shall provide such person with 
a copy of this Protective Order and obtain from such person a written 
acknowledgment stating that he or she has read this Protective Order and 
agrees to be bound by its provisions. All such acknowledgments shall be 
retained by counsel and shall be subject to in camera review by the Court if 
good cause for review is demonstrated by opposing counsel. 

Documents are designated as CONFIDENTIAL by placing or affixing on them 
(in a manner that will not interfere with their legibility) the following or other 
appropriate notice: “CONFIDENTIAL.” Discovery material designated 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be identified by Bates number. To the extent practical, 
the respective legend shall be placed near the Bates number. 

Designation of a document as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall 
constitute a representation that such document has been reviewed by an 
attorney for the designating party, that there is a valid and good faith basis for 
such designation, made at the time of disclosure or production to the receiving 
party, and that disclosure of such information to persons other than those 
permitted access to such material would cause a privacy harm to the 


designating party.

11. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 39-1 Filed 03/02/16 Page 5 of 7 


Whenever a deposition involves the disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION, the deposition or portions thereof shall be designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall be subject to the provisions of this Protective 
Order. Such designation shall be made on the record during the deposition 
whenever possible, but a party may designate portions of depositions as 
CONFIDENTIAL after transcription, provided written notice of the 
designation is promptly given to all counsel of record within thirty (30) days 
after notice by the court reporter of the completion of the transcript, and until 
the expiration of such thirty (30) days after notice by the court reporter of the 
completion of the transcript, no party or counsel for any such party may share 
the contents of the deposition outside the limitations of this Protective Order. 
Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be 
accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic 
Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of New York. 

A party may object to the designation of particular CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION by giving written notice to the party designating the disputed 
information. The written notice shall identify the information to which the 
objection is made. If the parties cannot resolve the objection within ten (10) 
business days after the time the notice is received, it shall be the obligation of 


the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL to file an

appropriate motion requesting that the Court determine whether the disputed 
information should be subject to the terms of this Protective Order. If such a 
motion is timely filed, the disputed information shall be treated as 
CONFIDENTIAL under the terms of this Protective Order until the Court rules 
on the motion. If the designating party fails to file such a motion within the 
prescribed time, the disputed information shall lose its designation as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall not thereafter be treated as CONFIDENTIAL in 
accordance with this Protective Order. In connection with a motion filed under 
this provision, the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL shall 
bear the burden of establishing that good cause exists for the disputed 
information to be treated as CONFIDENTIAL. 

At the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each 
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be returned to the party that designated it 
CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL 
documents. Where the parties agree to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, 
the destroying party shall provide all parties with an affidavit confirming the 
destruction. 

This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on the use of any 


CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this matter.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE 


United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 


Virginia L. Giuffre, 

Plaintiff, Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS 
V. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 


Defendant. 





PLAINTIFF VIRGINIA GIUFFRE’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S 
MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER 


Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully submits 
this Response to Defendant’s Motion for A Protective Order. 

I. BACKGROUND 

On February 5, 2016, Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, noticed Defendant Maxwell’s deposition 
for March 2, 2016. See Sigrid McCawley Declaration (hereinafter “McCawley Decl.) at Exhibit 
1. Due to Defendant’s counsel’s scheduling conflict, Ms. Giuffre re-noticed the deposition to 
March 25, 2016. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2. Defendant demanded that Ms. Giuffre agree 
to a Protective Order before Defendant would agree to sit for her deposition. See McCawley 
Decl. at Exhibit 3, (E-mail from Laura Menninger stating: “We have not and will not accept the 
date of March 25, or any other date, for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition until a protective order is in 
place.”). In an effort to move forward with the Defendant’s deposition without further delay, 
Ms. Giuffre stated that she would be willing to “agree to a reasonable Protective Order being in 


place in this case” and attached a redlined version of Defendant’s proposed Protective Order. 


See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4, McCawley e-mail correspondence dated February 26, 2016. 
Ms. Giuffre also communicated that she would agree to treat Maxwell’s deposition as 
confidential until such time as the Court would enter a Protective Order, to remove any need to 
delay Defendant’s March 25, 2016 deposition. Defendant never responded to Ms. Giuffre’s 
proposed revisions to the Protective Order: instead, she filed this Motion. 
IL. ARGUMENT 
Ms. Giuffre does not oppose the entrance of a Protective Order in this case, but does 
oppose a Protective Order in the form proposed by Defendant because it is overly broad and can 
lead to abuse and over designation of material as “confidential.” Ms. Giuffre’s proposal', which 
is attached in both a redlined version and a clean version (See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 5), 
addresses the following important issues: 
° Opening Paragraph: Given the fact that this case involves sexual abuse 
allegations of a minor child, Ms. Giuffre defined confidential information as: 
“including sensitive personal information relating to a victim of sexual abuse, 
copyright or trade secrets, commercially sensitive information or proprietary 
information.” Ms. Giuffre disagrees with Defendant’s broad definition which 
provided “or information which will improperly annoy, embarrass or oppress any 
party, witness or person providing discovery in the case.” There are a number of 
problems with Defendant’s proposed language, for example, evidence that 
demonstrates that Maxwell engaged in abuse of a minor is clearly “embarrassing” 
but that should not be deemed “confidential” solely because Maxwell does not 
want her crimes to be made public. Allowing Maxwell to make overly broad 


' Exhibit 5 varies slightly from Exhibit 4, the version sent to opposing counsel, because Ms. Giuffre 
corrected some typographical and spelling issues. 


confidentiality designations of that type of discovery would wrongfully allow the 
abuser to hide behind a claim of confidentiality. 

Purposes _and_ Limitations: Ms. Giuffre’s proposed revisions include an 
introductory “purpose” section which sets forth a requirement that confidential 
designations must be made in “good faith.” Ms. Giuffre contends this section is 
important to place an obligation on counsel to act in good faith and avoid broad 
sweeping confidentiality designations. 

Paragraph 3: In paragraph 3, Ms. Giuffre struck the word “implicates” and 
replaced it with “is covered by” because many things can “implicate” but only 
those things that are actually “covered by a common law and statutory privacy 
protection” should be deemed “confidential”. Ms. Giuffre also added “or any 
non-party that was subject to sexual abuse” because she anticipates there will be 
non-party witnesses in this case testifying to abuse they endured, and the non- 
parties should, likewise, be able to protect that sensitive personal information with 
a confidentiality designation. Accordingly, if Ms. Giuffre’s proposal is accepted, 
Paragraph 3 will read: “Information designated “Confidential” shall be 
information that is confidential and is covered by common law and statutory 
privacy protections of (a) plaintiff Virginia Giuffre (b) defendant Ghislaine 
Maxwell or (c) any non-party that was subject to sexual abuse.” 

Paragraph 4: Paragraph 4 provides: “Confidential information shall not be 
disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case.” 
Ms. Giuffre proposed adding to this sentence: “and any related matter, including 


but not limited to, investigations by law enforcement.” Ms. Giuffre’s addition is 


important because Defendant should not be able to shield her conduct from 
review by law enforcement by cloaking it in a “confidential” designation. 
Paragraph 5: Paragraph 5 addresses who may view confidential information and 
Ms. Giuffre proposed adding to that list: “(h) any person (1) who authored or 
received the particular Protected Material; (2) who has or had at any point in time 
access to the Protected Material outside of the context of this action; or (3) for 
which there is a good faith basis to conclude that the individual has earlier 
received or seen such Protected Material. and (j) any other person by written 
agreement of the parties or by Order of a Court of competent jurisdiction.” Ms. 
Giuffre made the proposed addition above because she contends it will alleviate 
debate over a document that has been marked “confidential” by one party but is a 
document that has been previously disclosed to certain individuals. 

Paragraph 11: Ms. Giuffre revised the protocol for challenging the designation 
of a document as “confidential” in order to stream line that process as follows: 
(a) A Party shall not be obligated to challenge the propriety of any designation of 
discovery material under this Order at the time the designation is made, and a 
failure to do so shall not preclude a subsequent challenge thereto. Moreover, 
failure to challenge the designation of any discovery material as 
CONFIDENTIAL shall not in any way constitute an admission that such material 
contains any competitively sensitive information, trade secret information, or 
other protectable material. (b) In the event that counsel for the Party receiving 
Protected Material objects to the CONFIDENTIAL designation of any or all such 


items, said counsel shall provide the Producing Party and, if different, the 


Designating Party written notice of, and the basis for, such objections. The 
Parties will use their best efforts to resolve such objections among themselves. 
Should the Receiving Party, the Producing Party and, if different, the Designating 
Party be unable to resolve the objections, the Receiving Party may seek a hearing 
before this Court with respect to the propriety of the designation. The 
Designating Party will cooperate in obtaining a prompt hearing with respect 
thereto. Pending a resolution, the discovery material in question shall continue to 
be treated as Protected Material as provided hereunder. The burden of proving 
that Discovery Material is properly designated shall at all times remain with the 
Designating Party.” 

Paragraph 13: Ms. Giuffre added paragraph 13 to provide protection for non- 
party witnesses who are subpoenaed in this case and are asked to disclose 
sensitive information regarding sexual abuse they may have endured. This 
paragraph provides a non-party with the opportunity to designate that sensitive 
information as “confidential”. The added paragraph 13 provides: “With respect to 
any Discovery Material produced by such non-party, the non-party may invoke 
the terms of this Order in writing to all Parties by designating discovery material 
“CONFIDENTIAL” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL—ATTORNEYS’ EYES 
ONLY”. Any such Protected Material produced by the non-party designated 
“CONFIDENTIAL” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL—ATTORNEYS’ EYES 
ONLY” shall be subject to the restrictions contained in this Order and shall only 


be disclosed or used in a manner consistent with this Order.” 


Paragraph 14: Ms. Giuffre added paragraph 14 to protect a circumstance of an 
inadvertent failure to designate and to include a protocol for how to handle a 
retroactive designation in that circumstance. The added paragraph 14 provides: 
“Tn the event that any Producing Party inadvertently produces Discovery Material 
eligible for designation as CONFIDENTIAL or HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL— 
ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY without such designation, the Parties agree that the 
Producing Party may retroactively apply the correct designation. If a Producing 
Party makes a subsequent designation, the Receiving Party will treat the Protected 
Material according to the retroactive designation, including undertaking best 
efforts to retrieve all previously distributed copies from any recipients now 
ineligible to access the Protected Material.” 

Paragraph 15: Ms. Giuffre also added a paragraph on “Limitations” to clarify 
that information that has been previously disclosed or is publicly available cannot 
be restricted from disclosure. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre added the following: 
“Limitations. Nothing in this Order shall restrict in any way the use or disclosure 
of Protected Material by a Receiving Party (a) that is or has become publicly 
known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) that is lawfully acquired by or 
known to the Receiving Party independent of the Producing Party; (c) that was 
previously produced, disclosed, and/or provided by the Producing Party to the 
Receiving Party or a non-party without an obligation of confidentiality and not by 
inadvertence or mistake; (d) with the consent of the Producing Party and, if 
different, the Designating Party; (e) pursuant to Order of the Court; or (f) for 


purposes of law enforcement.” 


As addressed above, Ms. Giuffre proposed revisions to ensure that the Protective Order is 
fair and limited in scope so as not to be subject to abuse. For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Giuffre 


respectfully requests that the Court grant Ms. Giuffre’s proposed revisions set forth in Exhibit 5.

Subject: FW: Giuffre v. Maxwell - [conferral concerning deposition dates] 
Sigrid ~ 


| would suggest that rather than repeated emails on the topic of scheduling the various depositions in this case, or the 
unilateral issuance of deposition notices and subpoenas, you and | have a phone conference wherein we discuss which 
depositions are going to be taken, where, and a plan for doing them in an orderly fashion that minimizes travel and 
inconvenience for counsel and the witnesses. As you are well aware from your own practice of law, attorneys have 
other clients, other court dates and other commitments to work around. The FRCP and Local Rules contemplate 
courtesy and cooperation among counsel in the scheduling and timing of discovery processes. This rule makes even 
more sense in a case such as this spanning various parts of the country where counsel must engage in lengthy travel and 
the attendant scheduling of flights, hotels and rental cars. 


| am available for such a cail today or tomorrow morning before 11 a.m. MST. 


To respond to your last email: 


Defendant’s Deposition 


We have not and will not accept the date of March 25, or any other date, for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition until a protective 
order isin place. My email of February 12" requested your position on a protective order and, receiving no response 
from you, | sent you a proposed one on February 20". As of today’s date, I still have not received your position or your 
comments to that protective order. 


Secondly, although the rules permit a party to seek leave of the court for a second deposition should new factors or 
evidence become known, you are aware in advance of Ms. Maxwell's deposition that she has yet to file an Answer or 
Counterclaim and therefore cannot be “surprised” about the fact that she will do so when and if necessary. Should you 
choose to take her deposition before such a pleading has been filed, you are acknowledging your waiver of the right to 
take a second deposition based on the filing of the answer and counterclaims because this is a fact known to you in 
advance of the first deposition. 


To reiterate, | have not accepted the date of March 25, 2016 for my client’s deposition and will not agree to schedule 
such a deposition in the absence of a protective order and your acknowledgement of waiver as outlined above. 


Other Witness Depositions 


| have asked to schedule the depositions of the two Florida witnesses on consecutive days to minimize travel expenses 
for counsel and you have refused. 


Additionally, it is completely unclear to me what, if any, relevance either of the two Florida witnesses have to the 
defamation action. My client has made no statements about either woman, nor has your client’s voluminous press and 
pleadings included any indication that either woman could corroborate her claims. Finally, as noted in my email to you 








Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-3 Filed 03/04/16 Page 3 of 8 


yesterday, Ms. Chambers is not even among the hundred witnesses listed in your Rule 26 disclosures, nor her contact 
info nor her counsel’s contact info. 


Please provide an offer of proof as to the relevance in this action (as compared to say, any of your client’s media, 
publicity and other litigations) of either Ms. Chambers or Ms. Sjoberg’s testimony. Also provide any contact information 
you have for them pursuant to Rule 26. 


| hope that we will be able to continue a professional dialogue regarding the timing and sequence of discovery in this 
case without the need for judicial intervention.

Subject: RE: Giuffre v. Maxwell - [conferral concerning deposition dates] 


Hello Laura, 
DEFENDANT’s DEPOSITION: 


As you are aware, we originally noticed your client’s deposition for March 2, 2016. We then provided you with multiple 
alternative dates because you stated that you had a conflict with the date provided. You have confirmed below that Ms. 
Maxwell is available for her deposition on March 25" in New York. The revised deposition notice is attached above. We 
understand that your client is requesting the entrance of a protective order in this case. We are in receipt of your 
proposed protective order and are reviewing and will provide you with a response to same shortly. 


With respect to your demand below that we concede that we will only seek to take one 7 hour deposition of the named 
defendant Ms. Maxwell in this case, we disagree that we have to make any such determination at this stage of the 
litigation. We are entitled under the rules to depose the defendant, without delay, for one 7 hour deposition. If after 


2 





Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-3 Filed 03/04/16 Page 4of8 


that deposition there are reasons that require us to seek additional time from the Court, we will do so and you can lodge 
any objections you have. You are not entitled to use your demand as a transparent delay tactic in an effort to preclude 
what is a critical deposition in this matter. 


NON- PARTY SUBPOENED WITNESSES: 

As a result of the conflict you had with our original date for Johanna Sjorberg’s deposition, we provided you with 
multiple alternatives. | understand you have a conflict with March 23 so please confirm you can be present for her 
deposition in Fort Lauderdale on March 16" in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 


Ms. Chambers and Ms. Sjorberg’s depositions cannot be taken on consecutive days because -- while they are both in the 
state of Florida — the travel distance is about 7 hours by car so it won’t work to schedule them consecutively. Moreover, 
these are non-party witnesses with varying work schedules that we are attempting to work around with their counsel 
and we have provided you will dates for which they are available. 


Please confirm you can be present at Alyson Chambers deposition in St. Augustine Florida on March 22”. For your 
travel arrangements, it is my understanding that the closest airport to St. Augustine is the Jacksonville, Florida airport. 


As for your interpretation of Local Rule 30.1 we have reviewed the case law and it is not our understanding that this type 
of payment applies automatically to a named party. That said, you are of course able to make your application to the 
court in accordance with that rule and we will respond with our opposition, but nothing in that rule allows you to 
attempt to delay a subpoenaed deposition based on that rule.

Sigrid - 


| had not responded regarding the dates yet, in part, because you did not address the two issues | raised by email of February 
12 (below). In particular, a protective order needs to be entered prior to Ms. Maxwell’s deposition to address the same 
concerns you raised prior to your client’s deposition in the Edwards/Casselt matter. | have taken the liberty of drafting a 
proposed protective order which | attach here. Please provide any comments you propose and we can get it filed and ruled 
upon by the Court. 


Further, you did not provide your acknowledgement pursuant to Rule 30(d)(1) that this deposition, which likely will occur 
before Ms. Maxwell has filed an answer or counterclaims, will be her only deposition in this matter. If this is not your 
agreement, then we will need to seek a ruling from the Court. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-3 Filed 03/04/16 Page 5of8 


Assuming that the attached protective order is entered in a timely fashion and your agreement that you will not be seeking a 
second deposition after Ms. Maxwell files an answer and counterclaim, then! can confirm the dates which will work for me 
and for her. Right now, of the dates you propose it appears that the March 25th date is best. 


Regarding the depositions of Ms. Sjoberg and Chambers, | propose that we do those on consecutive days. Unfortunately, |am 
not available on March 23d as | have a sentencing in USDC Colorado that morning. | could propose March 24-25 or March 17- 
18. Also, given that these depositions are “more than 100 miles from the courthouse,” | request your agreement to pay for 
my expenses for attendance at those depositions in Florida pursuant to Local R. 30.1.

Hello Laura, 


lam in receipt of your email below. As you are aware, the Court already denied your client’s effort to stay discovery 
pending her motion to dismiss. As you are also aware, discovery in this case closes in a few short months. We are 
proceeding with discovery and cannot agree to wait any further for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition. 


You indicated you had a conflict with the original date we selected for Ms. Maxwelil’s deposition so we have provided 
you with alternate dates for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition and would appreciate a timely response. You also stated that you 
had a conflict with the original subpoena date for Johanna Sjorberg. In an effort to accommodate the conflicts in your 
schedule, we provided you a selection of alternate dates that work for Ms. Sjorberg and her counsel and we have not 
heard back from you. Once again the dates are provided below. Please respond in a timely manner so we can schedule 
the depositions.

Sigrid — 


I’m happy to schedule a deposition for my client on a mutually agreeable date. | will check with her on these dates you 
have proposed and get back to you shortly. 


lt would make some sense to me to not schedule this deposition until after the judge rules on the motion to dismiss. If 
the motion is granted, we will have wasted time and money. If the Judge denies the motion, | intend to file an answer 
with affirmatives defenses as well as counterclaims against your client. 


Given that Rule 30(d} only permits one day of deposition lasting 7 hours, in the event you choose to depose Ms. Maxwell 
prior to the filing of our affirmative defenses and counterclaims, you will have exhausted that one chance to depose her, 
and | will not agree, and will vigorously contest, your ability to schedule a second deposition. 


We should also discuss an agreed upon protective order for discovery in this case. If you have one you like, please 
forward it to me, or | can take the lead in drafting.

| have received your Notice of Deposition for Ms. Maxwell on March 2 as well as your subpoena for the deposition of 
Johanna Sjoberg on February 22. | am not available on either one of those dates due to pre-existing scheduling conflicts. 


Local Rule 26.4(a) provides that “Counsel are expected to cooperate with each other, consistent with the interests of 
their clients, in all phases of the discovery process and to be courteous in their dealings with each other, including in 
matters relating to scheduling and timing of various discovery procedures.” 


| respectfully request that you send me other proposed dates that would work for you to take those two depositions so 
that | can clear them with my calendar and (as pertains to her deposition), my client’s calendar. Presumably,

Order.docx 

Hello Laura, 


It is clear to me based on the below that you are intentionally trying to stall the taking of these depositions, despite the 
fact that the Court denied your motion to stay discovery and are trying to grant yourself a de facto stay by placing 
conditions on these depositions that are not required by the Federa! Rules, in order to push off depositions as far as you 
can while you await a ruling on the motion to dismiss. Again — the court denied your stay request and you cannot use 
unreasonable demands to try to create that delay. We are entitled to take the defendant’s deposition in this case and 
we are not required to waive any rights in that process. 


As to your demand regarding a protective order, we have reviewed what you sent and can agree to a reasonable 
protective order being in place in this case and have attached redlined edits and a clean version for your review above. 


As for the contact information for the two subpoenaed witnesses — that was provided to you previously. The attorney 
representing Johanna Sjorberg and Alyson Chambers is Dore Louis. His number is (305) 374-0544 and 
mdl@sinciairlouis.com. Because you had conflicts with the initial dates we scheduled for Johanna, | have been 
coordinating with him on alternative depo dates which | provided you below. 


| will call you to discuss these depositions as they need to move forward without any additional delay. 


Thank you, 
Sigrid

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 3 of 26 


| would suggest that rather than repeated emails on the topic of scheduling the various depositions in this case, or the 
unilateral issuance of deposition notices and subpoenas, you and | have a phone conference wherein we discuss which 
depositions are going to be taken, where, and a plan for doing them in an orderly fashion that minimizes travel and 
inconvenience for counsel and the witnesses. As you are well aware from your own practice of law, attorneys have 
other clients, other court dates and other commitments to work around. The FRCP and Local Rules contemplate 
courtesy and cooperation among counsel in the scheduling and timing of discovery processes. This rule makes even 
more sense in a case such as this spanning various parts of the country where counsel must engage in lengthy travel and 
the attendant scheduling of flights, hotels and rental cars. 


| am available for such a cail today or tomorrow morning before 11 a.m. MST. 


To respond to your last email: 


Defendant’s Deposition 


We have not and will not accept the date of March 25, or any other date, for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition until a protective 
order is in place. My email of February 12" requested your position on a protective order and, receiving no response 
from you, | sent you a proposed one on February 20". As of today’s date, | still have not received your position or your 
comments to that protective order. 


Secondly, although the rules permit a party to seek leave of the court for a second deposition should new factors or 
evidence become known, you are aware in advance of Ms, Maxwell’s deposition that she has yet to file an Answer or 
Counterclaim and therefore cannot be “surprised” about the fact that she will do so when and if necessary. Should you 
choose to take her deposition before such a pleading has been filed, you are acknowledging your waiver of the right to 
take a second deposition based on the filing of the answer and counterclaims because this is a fact known to you in 
advance of the first deposition. 


To reiterate, | have not accepted the date of March 25, 2016 for my client’s deposition and will not agree to schedule 
such a deposition in the absence of a protective order and your acknowledgement of waiver as outlined above. 


Other Witness Depositions 


| have asked to schedule the depositions of the two Florida witnesses on consecutive days to minimize travel expenses 
for counsel and you have refused. 


Additionally, it is completely unclear to me what, if any, relevance either of the two Florida witnesses have to the 
defamation action. My client has made no statements about either woman, nor has your client’s voluminous press and 
pleadings included any indication that either woman could corroborate her claims. Finally, as noted in my email to you 
yesterday, Ms. Chambers is not even among the hundred witnesses listed in your Rule 26 disclosures, nor her contact 
info nor her counsel’s contact info. 


Please provide an offer of proof as to the relevance in this action (as compared to say, any of your client’s media, 
publicity and other litigations) of either Ms. Chambers or Ms. Sjoberg’s testimony. Also provide any contact information 
you have for them pursuant to Rule 26, 


| hope that we will be abie to continue a professional dialogue regarding the timing and sequence of discovery in this 
case without the need for judicial intervention.

Hello Laura, 
DEFENDANT’s DEPOSITION: 


As you are aware, we originally noticed your client’s deposition for March 2, 2016. We then provided you with multiple 
alternative dates because you stated that you had a conflict with the date provided. You have confirmed below that Ms. 
Maxwell is available for her deposition on March 25" in New York. The revised deposition notice is attached above. We 
understand that your client is requesting the entrance of a protective order in this case. We are in receipt of your 
proposed protective order and are reviewing and will provide you with a response to same shortly. 


With respect to your demand below that we concede that we will only seek to take one 7 hour deposition of the named 
defendant Ms. Maxwell in this case, we disagree that we have to make any such determination at this stage of the 
litigation. We are entitled under the rules to depose the defendant, without delay, for one 7 hour deposition. If after 
that deposition there are reasons that require us to seek additional time from the Court, we will do so and you can lodge 
any objections you have. You are not entitled to use your demand as a transparent delay tactic in an effort to preclude 
what is a critical deposition in this matter. 


NON- PARTY SUBPOENED WITNESSES: 

As a result of the conflict you had with our origina! date for Johanna Sjorberg’s deposition, we provided you with 
multiple alternatives. | understand you have a conflict with March 23” so please confirm you can be present for her 
deposition in Fort Lauderdale on March 16"" in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 





Ms. Chambers and Ms. Sjorberg’s depositions cannot be taken on consecutive days because -- while they are both in the 
state of Florida — the travel distance is about 7 hours by car so it won’t work to schedule them consecutively. Moreover, 
these are non-party witnesses with varying work schedules that we are attempting to work around with their counsel 
and we have provided you will dates for which they are available.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 5 of 26 


Please confirm you can be present at Alyson Chambers deposition in St. Augustine Florida on March 22™. For your 
travel arrangements, it is my understanding that the closest airport to St. Augustine is the Jacksonville, Florida airport. 


As for your interpretation of Local Rule 30.1 we have reviewed the case law and it is not our understanding that this type 
of payment applies automatically to a named party. That said, you are of course able to make your application to the 
court in accordance with that rule and we will respond with our opposition, but nothing in that rule allows you to 
attempt to delay a subpoenaed deposition based on that rule.

Sigrid - 


| had not responded regarding the dates yet, in part, because you did not address the two issues | raised by email of February 
12 (below). In particular, a protective order needs to be entered prior to Ms. Maxwell’s deposition to address the same 
concerns you raised prior to your client’s deposition in the Edwards/Cassell matter. | have taken the liberty of drafting a 
proposed protective order which | attach here. Please provide any comments you propose and we can get it filed and ruled 
upon by the Court. 


Further, you did not provide your acknowledgement pursuant to Rule 30(d)(1) that this deposition, which likely will occur 
before Ms. Maxwell has filed an answer or counterclaims, will be her only deposition in this matter. If this is not your 
agreement, then we will need to seek a ruling from the Court. 


Assuming that the attached protective order is entered in a timely fashion and your agreement that you will not be seeking a 
second deposition after Ms. Maxwell files an answer and counterclaim, then 1 can confirm the dates which will work for me 
and for her. Right now, of the dates you propose it appears that the March 25th date is best. 


Regarding the depositions of Ms. Sjoberg and Chambers, | propose that we do those on consecutive days. Unfortunately, lam 
not available on March 23d as | have a sentencing in USDC Colorado that morning, | could propose March 24-25 or March 17- 
18. Also, given that these depositions are “more than 100 miles from the courthouse,” | request your agreement to pay for 
my expenses for attendance at those depositions in Florida pursuant to Local R. 30.1. 


Thank you,

Hello Laura, 


iam in receipt of your email below. As you are aware, the Court already denied your client’s effort to stay discovery 
pending her motion to dismiss. As you are also aware, discovery in this case closes in a few short months. We are 
proceeding with discovery and cannot agree to wait any further for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition. 


You indicated you had a conflict with the original date we selected for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition so we have provided 
you with alternate dates for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition and would appreciate a timely response. You also stated that you 
had a conflict with the original subpoena date for Johanna Sjorberg. In an effort to accommodate the conflicts in your 
schedule, we provided you a selection of alternate dates that work for Ms. Sjorberg and her counsel and we have not 
heard back from you. Once again the dates are provided below. Please respond in a timely manner so we can schedule 
the depositions. 


Proposed Alternate Dates for Ms. Maxwell’s Deposition to be taken in NY at BSF’s Office — Feb. 29", March 1%, March 
14" or March 25". 


Proposed Alternate Dates for Ms. Sjorberg’s Deposition to be taken in Fort Lauderdale at BSF’s Office - March 16" or 
March 23”. 


Presently Scheduled Date for Alyson Chambers Deposition to be taken in St. Augustine Florida — March 22°. To my 
knowledge, you have not indicated that you have a conflict with this date. 


Thank you,

Sigrid — 


I'm happy to schedule a deposition for my client on a mutually agreeable date. | will check with her on these dates you 
have proposed and get back to you shortly. 


it would make some sense to me to not schedule this deposition until after the judge rules on the motion to dismiss. If 
the motion is granted, we will have wasted time and money. If the Judge denies the motion, | intend to file an answer 
with affirmatives defenses as well as counterclaims against your client. 


Given that Rule 30(d) only permits one day of deposition lasting 7 hours, in the event you choose to depose Ms. Maxwell 
prior to the filing of our affirmative defenses and counterclaims, you will have exhausted that one chance to depose her, 
and | will not agree, and will vigorously contest, your ability to schedule a second deposition. 


We should also discuss an agreed upon protective order for discovery in this case. If you have one you like, please 
forward it to me, or | can take the lead in drafting.

| have received your Notice of Deposition for Ms. Maxwell on March 2 as well as your subpoena for the deposition of

Local Rule 26.4(a) provides that “Counsel are expected to cooperate with each other, consistent with the interests of

matters relating to scheduling and timing of various discovery procedures.”

Plaintiff, 
v. 15-cv-07433-RWS 


Ghislaine Maxwell, 


Defendant. 


AGREED PROTECTIVE ORDER 

Upon a showing of good cause in support of the entry of a protective order to protect 
the discovery and dissemination of confidential information, including sensitive personal 
information relating to a victim of sexual abuse, copyright or trade secrets, commercially 
sensitive information, or proprietary information. 
I. Purposes And Limitations 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that this Order does not confer blanket protections on 
all disclosures during discovery. Designations under this Order shall be made sparingly, with 
care, and shall not be made absent a good faith belief that the designated material satisfies the 
criteria set forth herein. If it comes to a Designating Party’s attention that designated material 
does not qualify for protection at all, or does not qualify for the level of protection initially 
asserted, the Designating Party must promptly notify all other parties that it is withdrawing or 
changing the designation. 


IT IS ORDERED: 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 20 of 26 


This Protective Order shall apply to all documents, materials, and information, 

including without limitation, documents produced, answers to interrogatories, 

responses to requests for admission, deposition testimony, and other information 

disclosed pursuant to the disclosure or discovery duties created by the Federal 

Rules of Civil Procedure. 

As used in this Protective Order, “document” is defined as provided in 

FED.R.CIV.P. 34(a). A draft or non-identical copy is a separate document within 

the meaning of this term. 

Information designated “CONFIDENTIAL” shall be information that is 

confidential and is covered by common law and statutory privacy protections of 

(a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Giuffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine Maxwell or 

any non-party that was subject to sexual abuse. 

CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose 

except the preparation and trial of this case and any related matter, including 

but not limited to, investigations by law enforcement. 

CONFIDENTIAL documents, materials, and/or information (collectively 

“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION”) shall not, without the consent of the 

party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed except that such 

information may be disclosed to: 

a. attorneys actively working on this case; 

b. persons regularly employed or associated with the attorneys actively 
working on this case whose assistance is required by said attorneys in the 


preparation for trial, at trial, or at other proceedings in this case; 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 21 of 26 


c. the parties; 

d. expert witnesses and consultants retained in connection with this 
proceeding, to the extent such disclosure is necessary for preparation, trial 
or other proceedings in this case; 

e. the Court and its employees (“Court Personnel”) in this case; 

f. stenographic reporters who are engaged in proceedings necessarily incident 
to the conduct of this action; 

g. deponents, witnesses, or potential witnesses; 

h. any person (1) who authored or received the particular Protected Material; (2) 
who has or had at any point in time access to the Protected Material outside of 
the context of this action; or (3) for which there is a good faith basis to 
conclude that the individual has earlier received or seen such Protected 
Material; and 

i. any other persons by written agreement of the parties or by Order of a Court 
of competent jurisdiction. 

Prior to disclosing any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any person 

listed above (other than counsel, persons employed by counsel, Court 

Personnel and stenographic reporters), counsel shall provide such person with 

a copy of this Protective Order and obtain from such person a written 

acknowledgment stating that he or she has read this Protective Order and 

agrees to be bound by its provisions. All such acknowledgments shall be 
retained by counsel and shall be subject to in camera review by the Court if 


good cause for review is demonstrated by opposing counsel. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 22 of 26 


Documents are designated as CONFIDENTIAL by placing or affixing on them 
(in a manner that will not interfere with their legibility) the following or other 
appropriate notice: “CONFIDENTIAL.” Discovery material designated 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be identified by Bates number. To the extent practical, 
the respective legend shall be placed near the Bates number. 

Designation of a document as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall 
constitute a representation that such document has been reviewed by an 
attorney for the designating party, that there is a valid and good faith basis for 
such designation, made at the time of disclosure or production to the receiving 
party, and that disclosure of such information to persons other than those 
permitted access to such material would cause a privacy harm to the 
designating party. 

Whenever a deposition involves the disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION, the deposition or portions thereof shall be designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall be subject to the provisions of this Protective 
Order. Such designation shall be made on the record during the deposition 
whenever possible, but a party may designate portions of depositions as 
CONFIDENTIAL after transcription, provided written notice of the 
designation is promptly given to all counsel of record within thirty (30) days 
after notice by the court reporter of the completion of the transcript, and until 


the expiration of such thirty (30) days after notice by the court reporter of the 


11. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 23 of 26 


EG, 


completion of the transcript, no party or counsel for any such party may share 
the contents of the deposition outside the limitations of this Protective Order. 

Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be 
accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case 


Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of New York. 


Challenging Designations Of Protected Material 


(a) A Party shall not be obligated to challenge the propriety of any designation of 


Discovery Material under this Order at the time the designation is made, and a 
failure to do so shall not preclude a subsequent challenge thereto. Moreover, 
failure to challenge the designation of any Discovery Material as 
CONFIDENTIALshall not in any way constitute an admission that such material 
contains any competitively sensitive information, trade secret information, or 
other protectable material. 

(b) In the event that counsel for the Party receiving Protected Material objects 
to the CONFIDENTIAL designation of any or all such items, said counsel shall 
provide the Producing Party and, if different, the Designating Party written notice 
of, and the basis for, such objections. The Parties will use their best efforts to 
resolve such objections among themselves. Should the Receiving Party, the 


Producing Party and, if different, the Designating Party be unable to resolve the 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 24 of 26 


IS. 


14. 


objections, the Receiving Party may seek a hearing before this Court with respect 
to the propriety of the designation. The Designating Party will cooperate in 
obtaining a prompt hearing with respect thereto. Pending a resolution, the 
discovery material in question shall continue to be treated as Protected Material as 
provided hereunder. The burden of proving that Discovery Material is properly 
designated shall at all times remain with the Designating Party. 

At the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each 
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL 
shall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties 
may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to 
destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties 
with an affidavit confirming the destruction. 

With respect to any Discovery Material produced by such non-party, the non-party 
may invoke the terms of this Order in writing to all Parties by designating 
Discovery Material “CONFIDENTIAL”. Any such Protected Material produced 
by the non-party designated “CONFIDENTIAL.” shall be subject to the restrictions 
contained in this Order and shall only be disclosed or used in a manner consistent 
with this Order. 

In the event that any Producing Party inadvertently produces Discovery Material 
eligible for designation as CONFIDENTIAL without such designation, the Parties 


agree that the Producing Party may retroactively apply the correct designation. Ifa 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-4 Filed 03/04/16 Page 25 of 26 


Producing Party makes a subsequent designation, the Receiving Party will treat the 
Protected Material according to the retroactive designation, including undertaking 
best efforts to retrieve all previously distributed copies from any recipients now 
ineligible to access the Protected Material. 

Limitations. Nothing in this Order shall restrict in any way the use or disclosure 
of Protected Material by a Receiving Party (a) that is or has become publicly 
known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) that is lawfully acquired by or 
known to the Receiving Party independent of the Producing Party; (c) that was 
previously produced, disclosed, and/or provided by the Producing Party to the 
Receiving Party or a non-party without an obligation of confidentiality and not by 
inadvertence or mistake; (d) with the consent of the Producing Party and, if 
different, the Designating Party; (e) pursuant to Order of the Court; or (f) for 
purposes of law enforcement.15. This Protective Order shall have no force and 
effect on the use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this 

matter. This Protective Order may be modified by the Court at any time for good 
cause shown following notice to all parties and an opportunity for them to be 


heard.

c. the parties; 

d. expert witnesses and consultants retained in connection with this 
proceeding, to the extent such disclosure is necessary for preparation, trial 
or other proceedings in this case; 

e. the Court and its employees (“Court Personnel’’) in this case; 

f. stenographic reporters who are engaged in proceedings necessarily incident 
to the conduct of this action; 

g. deponents, witnesses, or potential witnesses; 

h. any person (1) who authored or received the particular Protected Material; (2) 
who has or had at any point in time access to the Protected Material outside of 
the context of this action; or (3) for which there is a good faith basis to 
conclude that the individual has earlier received or seen such Protected 
Material; and 

i. any other persons by written agreement of the parties or by Order of a Court 
of competent jurisdiction. 

6. Prior to disclosing any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any person 
listed above (other than counsel, persons employed by counsel, Court 
Personnel and stenographic reporters), counsel shall provide such person with 
a copy of this Protective Order and obtain from such person a written 


acknowledgment stating that he or she has read this Protective Order and 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-5 Filed 03/04/16 Page 14 of 18 


agrees to be bound by its provisions. All such acknowledgments shall be 
retained by counsel and shall be subject to in camera review by the Court if 


good cause for review is demonstrated by opposing counsel. 


Ts Documents are designated as CONFIDENTIAL by placing or affixing on them 
(in a manner that will not interfere with their legibility) the following or other 
appropriate notice: “CONFIDENTIAL.” Discovery material designated 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be identified by Bates number. To the extent practical, 
the respective legend shall be placed near the Bates number. 

8. Designation of a document as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall 
constitute a representation that such document has been reviewed by an 
attorney for the designating party, that there is a valid and good faith basis for 
such designation, made at the time of disclosure or production to the receiving 
party, and that disclosure of such information to persons other than those 
permitted access to such material would cause a privacy harm to the 
designating party. 

9. Whenever a deposition involves the disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION, the deposition or portions thereof shall be designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall be subject to the provisions of this Protective 
Order. Such designation shall be made on the record during the deposition 
whenever possible, but a party may designate portions of depositions as 


CONFIDENTIAL after transcription, provided written notice of the 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-5 Filed 03/04/16 Page 15 of 18 


10. 


Ti 


designation is promptly given to all counsel of record within thirty (30) days 

after notice by the court reporter of the completion of the transcript, and until 

the expiration of such thirty (30) days after notice by the court reporter of the 

completion of the transcript, no party or counsel for any such party may share 

the contents of the deposition outside the limitations of this Protective Order. 

Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing 

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be 

accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case 

Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of New York. 

Challenging Designations Of Protected Material 

(a) A Party shall not be obligated to challenge the propriety of any designation of 
discovery material under this Order at the time the designation is made, and a 
failure to do so shall not preclude a subsequent challenge thereto. Moreover, 
failure to challenge the designation of any discovery material as 
CONFIDENTIAL or HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL—ATTORNEYS’ EYES 
ONLY shall not in any way constitute an admission that such material 
contains any competitively sensitive information, trade secret information, or 
other protectable material. 

(b) In the event that counsel for the Party receiving CONFIDENTIAL Material 
objects to the CONFIDENTIAL or HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL— 


ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY designation of any or all such items, said 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-5 Filed 03/04/16 Page 16 of 18

13. 


counsel shall provide the Producing Party and, if different, the Designating 
Party written notice of, and the basis for, such objections. The Parties will use 
their best efforts to resolve such objections among themselves. Should the 
Receiving Party, the Producing Party and, if different, the Designating Party 
be unable to resolve the objections, the Receiving Party may seek a hearing 
before this Court with respect to the propriety of the designation. The 
Designating Party will cooperate in obtaining a prompt hearing with respect 
thereto. Pending a resolution, the discovery material in question shall 
continue to be treated as CONFIDENTIAL as provided hereunder. The 
burden of proving that discovery material is properly designated shall at all 
times remain with the Designating Party. 
At the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each 
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL 
shall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties 
may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to 
destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties 
with an affidavit confirming the destruction. 
With respect to any discovery material produced by such non-party, the non-party 
may invoke the terms of this Order in writing to all Parties by designating 
discovery material “CONFIDENTIAL” or “HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL— 


ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY”. Any such protected material produced by the 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 41-5 Filed 03/04/16 Page 17 of 18 


14. 


1D, 


non-party designated “CONFIDENTIAL” or ““HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL— 
ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY” shall be subject to the restrictions contained in this 
Order and shall only be disclosed or used in a manner consistent with this Order. 

In the event that any Producing Party inadvertently produces discovery material 
eligible for designation as CONFIDENTIAL or HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL— 
ATTORNEYS’ EYES ONLY without such designation, the Parties agree that the 
Producing Party may retroactively apply the correct designation. If a Producing 
Party makes a subsequent designation, the Receiving Party will treat the Protected 
Material according to the retroactive designation, including undertaking best 
efforts to retrieve all previously distributed copies from any recipients now 
ineligible to access the Protected Material. 

Limitations. Nothing in this Order shall restrict in any way the use or disclosure 
of CONFIDENTIAL material by a Receiving Party (a) that is or has become 
publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) that is lawfully 
acquired by or known to the Receiving Party independent of the Producing Party; 
(c) that was previously produced, disclosed, and/or provided by the Producing 
Party to the Receiving Party or a non-party without an obligation of 
confidentiality and not by inadvertence or mistake; (d) with the consent of the 
Producing Party and, if different, the Designating Party; (e) pursuant to Order of 


the Court; or (f) for purposes of law enforcement.

DEFENDANT’S COMBINED MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN 
OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL THE 
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS SUBJECT TO IMPROPER CLAIM OF 
PRIVILEGE AND SUBJECT TO IMPROPER OBJECTIONS 


Laura A. Menninger 

HADDON, MORGAN AND FOREMAN, P.C. 
East 10th Avenue 

Denver, CO 80203 

303.831.7364 


ARGUMENT 


I. PLAINTIFF FAILED TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUIREMENT TO 
CONFER IN GOOD FAITH PRIOR TO FILING MOTIONS TO COMPEL 


Rule 37(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a motion to 
compel “must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or 
attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an 
effort to obtain it without court action.” (emphasis added) Notwithstanding this Rule, 
Plaintiff filed two Motions to Compel (Doc. #s 33 and 35), neither of which includes the 
required certification. More importantly, Plaintiff, in direct contradiction to both the 
letter and spirit of Rule 37, did not make any effort to confer with Ms. Maxwell’s counsel 
regarding any of the issues presented in her Motions to Compel. This significant 
deficiency alone warrants the denial of both Motions. Auto. Club of New York, Inc. v. 
Port Auth. Of New York & New Jersey, No. 11 CIV. 6746 RKE HBP, 2012 WL 4791804, 
at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2012) (failure to make any attempts to resolve any specific 
discovery disputes “alone is a sufficient ground for denying the motion [to compel]’’); 
Prescient Partners, L.P. v. Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc. 96-CV-7590 (DAB)(JCF), 1998 WL 
67672, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 1998) (“Ordinarily...a motion to compel must be denied 
where the parties have failed to meet and confer.”); Dorchester Fin. Holdings Corp. v. 
Banco BRJ, S.A., No. 11-CV-1529 KMW KNF, 2014 WL 3747167, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July 
28, 2014) (same).' 

The purpose of Rule 37(a)(1) is to encourage the parties to informally resolve 


discovery disputes in an effort to avoid the unnecessary time and expense of motion 





, Indeed, during the time period in which Plaintiff was drafting her voluminous Motions 
to Compel, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was busy conferring with Plaintiff's counsel on a number of 
different discovery disputes, including location of depositions, timing of depositions, a protective 
order, and Plaintiff's responses to interrogatories. See generally Plaintiff's Letter Motion of 
February 26, 2016, Attachments (filed in contravention of this Court’s Individual Practices 1(A), 
“Copies of correspondence between counsel shall not be sent to this Court.”). The product of 
those conferrals was resolution of many of the parties’ issues. 


1 


practice and formal court hearings. See Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1993 
Amendment. Here, had Plaintiff conferred with Ms. Maxwell prior to filing her motions 
to compel, several issues could have been resolved without Court intervention. While 
this list is by no means exhaustive, Ms. Maxwell highlights the following disputed areas 
that likely could be resolved by a conferral among counsel: 

First, Plaintiff argues that the Ms. Maxwell’s privilege log is inadequate, in part 
because she does not assert “that individuals such as Brett Jaffe, Philip Barden, or Martin 
Weinberg represent her, or that any attorney-client relationship exists between them.” 
(Mot. Compel Priv. at 13). Certainly, court intervention is unnecessary to resolve the 
question of whether a certain attorney represented Ms. Maxwell at the time claimed in a 
privilege log entry. Local Civil Rule 26.2 requires that for written communications, a 
privilege log should include the author of the document, the addressees of the document, 
and any other recipients and “where not apparent, the relationship of the author, 
addressees and recipients to each other.” Neither the Local Rules nor the Federal Rules 
require a privilege log to include explanation or proof that an attorney-client relationship 
existed between an author and recipient of an email. In her log, Ms. Maxwell included 
the names of the parties to the communication and described the relationship of the 
parties. For example, in an entry for an email dated January 10, 2015, between Ms. 
Maxwell and Philip Barden, Esq., Ms. Maxwell described the relationship of the parties 
as “attorney/client.” If Plaintiff needed further clarification regarding that relationship, 
she could have, and should have, conferred with Ms. Maxwell.” 

Second, Plaintiff takes issue with Ms. Maxwell’s objection to Plaintiff's asserted 
“Relevant Time Period” of 1999 to the present. (Mot. Compel Imp. Obj. at 4-8). On this 
issue, while the parties’ respective definitions of the Relevant Time Period are currently 


far apart, it is likely that the parties would be able to reach a compromised limitation for 





2 Perhaps Plaintiff needs reminding that she has in her possession, and indeed has filed 
with this Court, documents reflecting Mr. Jaffe, Mr. Barden and Mr. Cohen’s representations of 
Ms. Maxwell in the course of litigation and other proceedings associated with Plaintiff's 
allegations. A conferral on this point alone will save the parties’ expense in needlessly gathering 
affidavits from various attorneys and will save the Court’s time. 


2 


many of Plaintiff's requests. Such a compromise would either eliminate the need for 
court intervention entirely or at the very least, drastically minimize the scope of any 
potential motion to compel. For example, Plaintiff's Request No. 22 asks for “All 
documents relating to calendars, schedules or appointments for you from 1999 — present.” 
The overbreadth of this request is obvious. And while this Request may technically yield 
relevant documents, the Request could also yield such a large volume of unrelated 
documents that the balance of the production would not be “proportional to the needs of 
the case.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). 

Third, the majority of Plaintiffs requests are presumptively overbroad. Plaintiff 
routinely uses the phrases “all documents relating to” or “relating to” as part of her 
requests for production of documents. See, e.g., Requests Nos. 1, 3, 6,7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 22, 
23, 24, 32 and 33. Where the phrase “relating to” is not employed, Plaintiff uses equally 
obtuse synonyms such as “reflecting” (Requests Nos. 34, 37) or “associated with.” 
(Request No. 21). 

“Relate” is a broad term. See, e.g., WEBSTER’S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY 1198 
(2d Coll. Ed. 1986) (defining “relate” to mean, inter alia, “to connect or associate, as in 
thought or meaning; show as having to do with,” “to have some connection or relation 
(to),” and “to have reference (to)”). Courts have condemned the use of “related to” as 
overbroad and have refused to compel a responding party to answer discovery requests 
using the term. See, e.g., Meeker v. Life Care Ctrs. of Am., No. 14-CV-02101-WYD- 
NYW, 2015 WL 4400533, at *4 (D. Colo. July 20, 2015) (denying motion to compel 
response to interrogatory that required identification of all documents that “relate to” 
drills or safety security training exercises “over a decade long span,” and holding that 
interrogatory was “facially overbroad, and potentially sweep[s] in incidents that are not 
proximate in location, time, and may not even be remotely of the “same type’’); Avante 
Int’l Tech., Inc. v. Hart Intercivic, Inc., No. CIV. 07-169-DRH, 2008 WL 2074093, at *3 
(S.D. Ill. May 14, 2008) (“the court finds that the request to identify ‘all documents that 
refer or relate to each such person's contribution’ to be overbroad and unduly 


burdensome, and sustains the objection to that part of the interrogatory”); In re Urethane 


2 


Antitrust Litig., No. 04-MD-1616-JWL-DJW, 2008 WL 110896, at *1 (D. Kan. Jan. 8, 
2008) (holding that a discovery request is overly broad and unduly burdensome on its 
face if it uses an “omnibus term” such as “relating to,” because “such broad language 
‘make[s] arduous the task of deciding which of numerous documents may conceivably 
fall within its scope’”’); Roda Drilling Co. v. Siegal, No. 07-CV-400-GFK-FHM, 2008 
WL 2234652, at *2 (N.D. Okla. May 29, 2008) (finding that “many of the parties’ 
requests for production of documents are overbroad, as they request ‘all documents' 
relating to or concerning a subject”), reconsideration denied in part, 2008 WL 3892067 
(N.D. Okla. Aug. 14, 2008); Cotracom Commodity Trading Co. v. Seaboard Corp., 189 
F.R.D. 655, 665 (D. Kan. 1999) (holding that challenged discovery request was facially 


999 


overbroad due to its use of the “omnibus phrase ‘relating to’”’); Parsons v. Jefferson-Pilot 
Corp., 141 F.R.D. 408, 412 (M.D.N.C. 1992) (“[b]road and undirected requests for all 
documents which relate in any way to the complaint are regularly stricken as too 
ambiguous’’). 

And, Plaintiff has expanded the dictionary definition of “relate” in her definition 
section to make any attempt at deciding what documents might fall within the requests 
impossible. 

Respectfully, this is an issue that should be discussed by professional counsel to 
attempt to craft a meaningful request, if possible. Here, no attempt has been made by 
Plaintiff to do so. 

In light of the many areas in which a compromise could be reached between the 
parties, Plaintiff cannot claim her attempt to confer with Ms. Maxwell’s counsel would 
have been futile. C.f, Alexander Interactive, Inc. v. Adorama, Inc., No. 12 CIV. 6680 
PKC JCF, 2013 WL 6283511, at * 3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2013) (recognizing that the merits 
of a discovery motion may be addressed despite a failure to confer where the papers 
submitted by the parties “‘indicate[d] that both sides have dug in-indeed... Ordering the 
parties to meet and confer is unlikely to resolve these disputes.”). Similarly, because this 
case is in its relatively early stages (Ms. Maxwell has yet to answer the Complaint) there 


are no temporal exigencies that would require immediate action. C.f: In re NASDAQ 


4 


Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., No. 94 Civ. 3996 (RWS), 1996 WL 187409, at * 
(S.D.N.Y. April 18, 1996) (J. Sweet) (finding the failure to meet and confer was 
mitigated by “the imminence of the deadlines for filing of papers relating to the class 
certification motion...”’). 

I. PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT THAT MS. MAXWELL DID NOT “SUBMIT 
EVIDENCE” TO SUPPORT HER CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE IS 
PREMATURE 
In support of her Motion to Compel Documents Subject to Improper Claim of 

Privilege, Plaintiff argues that Ms. Maxwell failed to satisfy her burden of establishing 

privilege because she did not submit “competent evidence, usually through affidavits, 

deposition testimony, or other admissible evidence.” Mot. Compel Priv. at 3. This 
argument is premature. 

The established practice in this Court is for the party to challenge an assertion of 
privilege, after which the burden shifts to the withholding party to come forward with 
evidence establishing the elements of the applicable privilege or protection. See Veleron 
Holding, B.V. v. BNP Paribas SA,No. 12-CV-5966 CM RLE, 2014 WL 4184806, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2014) (“Once an assertion of privilege is challenged, the withholding 
party must ‘submit evidence...establishing only the challenged elements of the applicable 
privilege or protection, with the ultimate burden of proof resting with the party asserting 
the privilege or protection.’”) (quoting A.I.A. Holdings, S.A. v. Lehman Bros. Inc., 97- 
CV-4978 (LMM), 2002 WL 31385824, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 2002)). Indeed, the 
conferral process is exactly when the burden would shift to the withholding party. Thus, 
the Motion to Compel should be denied as premature and Ms. Maxwell should be 
afforded an opportunity to meet her burden. 

For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court deny 
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel and order the parties to meet and confer in good faith, as 
required under Rule 26(a)(1). Ms. Maxwell also respectfully requests permission to refile 
her response to Plaintiffs Motions in the event the conferral is unsuccessful.

Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully submits this 
Consolidated Reply in Support of her Motion to Compel the Production of Documents Subject to 
Improper Claim of Privilege and Motion to Compel the Production of Documents Subject to 
Improper Objections. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should grant Plaintiff's Motions 
in their entirety. 


I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 


It took an Order from this Court to force the Defendant to participate in and begin the 
discovery process. From the moment this case began, it appears that the Defendant’s goal has 
been obstruction and delay, with the apparent aim of avoiding discovery altogether. The 
Defendant’s opposition brief is the perfect example of this ongoing tactic, because rather than 
address the merits of her inadequate discovery responses, Defendant relies only on the misguided 
argument that Ms. Giuffre failed to satisfy a meet and confer obligation. As Ms. Giuffre 
demonstrates herein, no such requirement existed for these motions, as the Defendant’s persistence 
in avoiding discovery rendered futile any attempt to engage in a meet and confer process. 

From the outset of this litigation, the Defendant has consistently sought to avoid any 
participation in the discovery process. Indeed, Ms. Giuffre served her discovery requests in 
October — it is now March and the Defendant has only produced two (2) e-mails in response to 
Ms. Giuffre’s discovery requests. This conduct began with a motion to stay all discovery in the 
case, which this Court denied. Defendant also missed the deadline for filing her Rule 26 
disclosures and then waited an additional three months before filing the Rule 26 disclosures.’ 
Additionally, when Ms. Giuffre’s counsel sought dates for Defendant’s deposition, Defendant’s 
counsel responded that her client would not sit for deposition unless Ms. Giuffre agreed to waive 


future rights in this case. See S. McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, Letter Brief to Judge Sweet 


' Rule 26(a)(1)(a), Fed. R. Civ. P. requires that parties produce certain discovery without awaiting a 
discovery request.” (Emphasis added). 


Regarding Defendant’s Refusal to Sit for a Deposition. To date, Defendant has still failed to agree 
to sit for her deposition which was noticed a second time for March 25, 2016. Now, in response to 
Ms. Giuffre’s requests for production, after requesting an additional extension of time to respond, 
the Defendant submitted wholesale, blanket objections that are facially improper, and moreover, 
Defendant unilaterally chose to eliminate over three-fourths of the time period of Ms. Giuffre’s 
requests. With these responses, Defendant served a facially overbroad and legally deficient 
privilege log, where, among other things, she repeatedly asserted attorney-client privilege over 
communications that did not even involve an attorney. This repeated pattern of avoidance of 
Defendant’s discovery obligations demonstrates the futility of any meet and confer. 

Defendant’s meet and confer arguments are particularly ironic where, after waiting four 
months to produce any discovery or her initial disclosures (then producing a mere two e-mails), 
her opposition brief does not offer a single example of any willingness to reconsider her 
improper, blanket objections. This Defendant appears to simply not want to participate in the 
discovery process, and her failure to respond substantively is another effort to delay and prejudice 
Ms. Giuffre’s ability to prosecute her case. 

Il. ARGUMENT 


1. Conference Is Futile When A Party Is Stonewalling Discovery 


“[C]ourts have recognized that the meet-and-confer requirement is not a prerequisite to 
addressing the merits of a discovery motion and that it may be excused where the meet-and-confer 
would be futile.” Gibbons v. Smith, No. 01 CIV. 1224 (LAP), 2010 WL 582354, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Feb. 11, 2010) (granting motion to compel). “[A] court may rule on a motion to compel even 
where the meet and confer requirement is entirely lacking.” Stinson v. City of New York, (Sweet, 
J.), No. 10 Civ. 4228(RWS), 2015 WL 4610422, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2015) (Internal citations 


omitted) (granting in part motion to compel documents). See also Metrokane, Inc. v. Built NY, 


Inc., No. 066CIV14447LAKMHD, 2008 WL 4185865, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 3, 2008) (granting in 
part motion for sanctions, finding that a met-and-confer session would have been futile); See also 
Time Inc. v. Simpson, No. 02 Civ. 4917, 2002 WL 31844914, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2002) 
(holding that the moving party’s failure to satisfy meet and confer requirement does not warrant 
rejecting its motion). 7 

Similarly, where claims of privilege are in dispute, courts have recognized that there is no 
“compromise” to be reached as to whether or not a document is privileged. See Veleron Holding, 
B.V. v. BNP Paribas SA, No. 12-CV-5966 CM RLE, 2014 WL 4184806, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 
2014) (“The principle separating the Parties was not amenable to compromise: either the privilege 
applied or it did not.’’) (rejecting argument of failure to meet and confer). See also Safeco Ins. Co. 
of America v. M.E.S., Inc., No. 099-CV—3312, 2013 WL 1680684, at *4 (noting that “[i]n camera 
review is ‘a practice both long-standing and routine in cases involving claims of privilege.”’). 

Defendant’s current attempt to stall discovery is through the submission of improper, 
sweeping objections alleging overbreadth of Ms. Giuffre’s requests. As Ms. Giuffre demonstrated 
in her motion, such objections are legally deficient, and the only way to move discovery forward 
in this matter is to have the Court compel Defendant to produce the responsive documents that Ms. 
Giuffre properly requested. It is also apparent that the only way Ms. Giuffre will be able to depose 
Defendant — the opposing party in this case - is for this Court to Order her deposition. See S. 
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, Letter Brief to Judge Sweet Regarding Defendant’s Refusal to Sit 
for a Deposition. 

Defendant’s tactic of stonewalling and delay is the underlying problem, and requiring a 
meet and confer prior to the Court addressing this conduct would reward Defendant’s 


intransigence. The Complaint was filed September 21, 2015. Defendant’s responsive pleading 


* Defendant cites several cases from outside the jurisdiction. None are relevant because the facts and 
circumstances in those cases make them inapposite as each result turned on specific facts not present here.

was due on October 13, 2015, but Defendant requested a month and a half extension of time until 
November 30, 2015 to respond to the Complaint. The Court set the parties on a tight discovery 
schedule with the close of discovery set for July 1, 2016. Ms. Giuffre served her discovery 
requests on October 27, 2016. Defendant then waited until November 30, 2016, and rather than 
respond to the discovery, she filed a Motion to Stay discovery which was ultimately denied by the 
Court on January 20, 2016 (D.E. 28). The Court, in its January 20, 2016 Order, acknowledged 
that Defendant already had substantial time to respond, noting that “Defendant was served with 
the request on October 27, 2015 and has therefore had an additional month and a half to digest the 
requests than is usually permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” See Order re Motion 
to Stay Discovery, D.E. 28, at 7. After having delayed through more than half of the discovery 
period granted by this Court, and after seeking an additional extension of time to respond to 
discovery, rather than properly respond to Ms. Giuffre’s discovery, Defendant stonewalled, 
lodging a litany of baseless objections including a substantial and unjustified reduction of the date 
range covered by the requests. Ms. Giuffre’s requests were served in October, 2015. It is now 
March, and Defendant has still failed to adequately respond to discovery. 

Defendant has attempted to grant herself a de facto stay in discovery through intentional 
delay, in contravention of this Court’s Order, and the Court must put an end to the gamesmanship. 
These delay tactics are prejudicing Ms. Giuffre, as despite serving her requests in October of last 
year, and despite it being less than four months before the discovery cut-off deadline, Defendant 
has produced exactly two documents and has blocked any path forward in which to take her 
deposition absent a Court order. See D.E. 13. 

Courts consistently recognize that no meet and confer obligation exists in such a 
circumstance, and this Court should reject defendant’s attempt at additional procedural delay. 


“(Meet and confer] requirements are designed to promote efficiency in litigation, and that goal 


would not be advanced by further delay in resolving these issues on the merits.” See Time Inc. v. 
Simpson, No. 02 Civ. 4917, 2002 WL 31844914, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2002) (holding that the 
moving party’s failure to satisfy meet and confer requirement does not warrant rejecting its 
motion). 

2. This Court Should Reject Defendant’s Improper Objections 

Defendant’s overbreadth argument is a complete red herring, as Defendant does not -- and 
cannot -- make the argument that any of the requests constitute an undue burden due to the volume 
of the responsive documents at issue.* Defendant is not a corporation; she is an individual with a 
single set of emails and related electronic documents that would be responsive. This is not a case 
where - and Defendant raises no claim that - complying with the document requests would result 
in an unmanageable number of documents. Instead, Defendant is picking and choosing which 
documents she will produce, and which documents she will keep hidden. She’s not making this 
determination based on responsiveness, or based on undue burden, but, instead, based on 
preference. This is impermissible.” See Graham v. Ortiz, No. 07-CV-1690 (JG)(LB), 2009 WL 
4016055, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 2009)(‘Plaintiff does not get to pick and choose what 
[discovery request] he will comply with”); Agua Products, Inc. v. Aquaquality Pool & Spa, Inc., 


No. CV 05-2538 DRH ARL, 2006 WL 2884913, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2006) (“Counsel cannot 


> While defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre’s counsel did not confer with her about her deficient discovery 
responses, Ms. Giuffre’s counsel understood the Court’s individual practices to not require such a pre- 
motion conference. Even if Ms. Giuffre’s counsel misunderstood the Court’s individual practices, 
Defendant’s response proves that such conferral would have been futile because even in the response, 
Defendant fails to make any concessions to her abusive refusal to produce responsive documents. 


* Defendant communicated neither to Ms. Giuffre nor to the Court that the requests would yield a 
voluminous or unmanageable number of documents. 


> “When determining a motion to compel the production of ESI, a district court conducts a two-stage 
inquiry: first, has the party resisting discovery shown that the information in question is not reasonably 
accessible because of undue cost, and second, has the party requesting discovery nonetheless shown good 
cause to obtain it?” Stinson v. City of New York, (Sweet, J.) 2015 WL 4610422, at *4 (Emphasis added).

pick and choose those documents that they believe satisfies the request; rather, they must provide 
the plaintiff with all non-privileged responsive documents in their client's possession.”) 

Most significant is the fact that Defendant unilaterally purports to limit her production, 
which requested documents from 1999 to the present, to less than a quarter of what is requested, 
arbitrarily refusing to produce highly relevant discovery.° At the same time, she has propounded 
discovery on Ms. Giuffre for a longer period of time: 1998 to the present.’ Ms. Giuffre sought 
documents from 1999 to the present because the first part of that period is when she contends 
convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Defendant were engaging in sexual trafficking conduct; 
the later part of that period includes the investigations by law enforcement and the co- 
conspirator’s efforts to coordinate and cover up the abuse that occurred. Therefore, the entire time 
period is highly relevant to the sexual abuse claims that underlie this defamation action. 

Ms. Giuffre outlined in detail in her moving papers, using specific examples, why 
documents from 1999 to the present are highly relevant to this action. (See D.E. 35 at 4-6.) For 
example, flight logs show Defendant traveling on the convicted sex offender’s plane up to at least 
2005; police reports in the Palm Beach investigation reveal the abuse occurred into the mid- 
2000s; victim notification letters were sent in 2008; Defendant dodged a deposition in 2009 to 
avoid having to answer questions about the abuse of Ms. Giuffre and others; and Defendant 
continued to communicate with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein until at least 2015. As 


explained in Ms. Giuffre’s Motion to Compel, the abuse underlying this case started in or around 


° Defendant contends she will only produce documents for the month of December 31, 2014 to January 31, 
2015 and from 1999 — 2002. Ms. Giuffre requested documents from 1999 to the present. 


’ Specifically, Defendant does not define a “Relevant Period” in her Requests for Production. Instead, she 
defines the time period within the individual requests, asking for documents from “1998 to the present,” 
“since 1998,” “between 1998 and the present,” etc. This 1998-present “Relevant Period” applies to Nos. 5, 
12, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 35, and many requests have no date restrictions whatsoever. See, e.g., Request No. 
26, “All Documents concerning any prescription drugs taken by You, including the prescribing doctor, the 
dates of said prescription, and the dates of any fulfillment of any such prescription.” In short, Defendant 
requests documents from an even longer period of time than Ms. Giuffre does. 


6 


1999, and Defendant has continued her association with Jeffrey Epstein up until at least 2015, 
when the defamatory statement was made, as evidenced by her privilege log. See McCawley 
Decl. at Exhibit 2, Maxwell’s Privilege Log. Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre has shown good cause for 
requiring the production of these documents. Indeed, this is not a situation where Defendant does 
not have responsive documents during that time period. Defendant has admitted she has 
responsive documents, but is simply refusing to produce the documents. Therefore, based upon 
the timeline set forth in the moving papers, Ms. Giuffre respectfully requests that this Court direct 
Defendant to produce responsive documents from 1999 to the present. 

Defendant argues that the Requests for Production are “presumptively broad,” thus 
apparently improper, because they employed terms such as “all documents” and “relating to.” 
That is not the law. “Although not unlimited, relevance, for purposes of discovery, is an 
extremely broad concept.” Ottoson v. SMBC Leasing and Finance, Inc., (Sweet, J.) 2015 WL 
4597542 at * 2 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2015) (granting motion to compel) (internal quotations 
omitted); Stinson v. City of New York, (Sweet, J.), 2015 WL 4610422 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2015) 


(granting in part motion to compel production). 


* In her Response, Defendant takes issue with Ms. Giuffre’s requests of “all documents” that “relate to” 
various topics. However, Defendant also seeks from Ms. Giuffre “all documents” in 22 of her discovery 
requests, and employs the term “relate” in 11 of her discovery requests, including requests such as “[a]l1 
documents relating to any Communications occurring from 1998 to the present with . . .Sky Roberts,” who 
is Ms. Giuffre’s father. 


Furthermore, Defendant’s own definition of “relate” is expansive. Defendant states “relate,” 
“related,” and “relating” “means concerning, referring to, responding to, relating to, pertaining to, 
connected with, evidencing, commenting on, regarding, discussing, showing, describing, reflecting, 
analyzing or constituting.” Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests to Plaintiff. Notably, her definition 
also includes the terms “reflecting” and “regarding.” 


Defendant’s Request for Production containing the term “all documents” are Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 
13, 15,17,18, 21, 23,24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, and 36. Defendant’s Request for Production 
containing the term “any documents” are Nos. 9, 33, and 36. Defendant’s Request for Production 
containing the term “relate” or “relating” are Nos. 3, 5, 10, 17, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36. The Requests for 
Production containing the word “reflect” or “reflecting” are Nos. 4, 9, 11, 19, 20, 24, 28, 33, 35, and 36. 


The contention that Ms. Giuffre’s Requests for Production are “presumptively overbroad” 
is also directly refuted by the specific nature of the requests. Indeed, all of Ms. Giuffre’s 
discovery requests with the term “relating to” are linked to specific topics that are highly relevant 
to this action. For example, Request No. 6 seeks all communications that Defendant had with 
Sarah Kellen. These documents are critical to this case because Sarah Kellen was questioned at 
deposition in another action related to Defendant’s abuse of minor children, wherein Sarah Kellen 
invoked her Fifth Amendment Privilege: 


Q. Would you agree with me that Ghislaine Maxwell provides underage girls to 


Mr. Epstein for sex? 
28 2K 


A. Upon the instruction of my lawyer, I must invoke my Fifth Amendment 
privilege. 


See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Defendant’s Response to Plaintiff's Request for Production of 
Documents. For another example, Request No. 1 seeks “[a]ll documents relating to 
communications with Jeffery Epstein from 1999 — Present.” These requests go to key issues in 
this case. Defendant has admitted that she has documents responsive to request for documents 
that go to the heart of this matter, she is simply refusing to produce them. 

Defendant’s sweeping “overbroad” objections should be rejected because it is a 
fundamentally misleading argument in furtherance of Defendant’s ongoing goal of delay. Am. 
Rock Salt Co., LLC v. Norfolk S. Corp., 228 F.R.D. 426, 432 (W.D.N.Y. 2004) (“generalized 
objections that discovery requests are vague, overly broad, or unduly burdensome are not 
acceptable, and will be overruled.”). Therefore, this Court should require Defendant to produce 


the documents she admits to withholding. 


3. This Court Should Grant Plaintiff's Motion To Compel The Production Of 
Documents Subject To Improper Claim Of Privilege 


There are four key problems with Defendant’s privilege log that result in finding of waiver, 
or at least warrant in camera review. First, Defendant attempts to wrongfully claim that the 


8 


attorney-client privilege shields documents from production as to her communications with non- 
attorneys (including communications between herself and public relations professional Ross Gow, 
who was Defendant’s press agent who issued the defamatory statements that lie at the heart of this 
matter). See Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Improper Claim of Privilege D.E. 33 at 6-9). 

Second, Defendant improperly claims a “common interest” privilege applies to her 
communications with convicted sex offender — and non-attorney -- Jeffrey Epstein for which no 
attorney-client privilege applies, thus, precluding the application of the “common interest” 
privilege. See Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290 F.R.D. 421, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“communications 
are protected where there is a disclosure by A to the attorney representing B and vice-versa’’). 
Defendant’s communications with her co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein are not privileged in any way 
and they are also highly relevant to the claim in this case. 

Third, Defendant improperly claims the attorney-client privilege when the communications 
involved the presence of a third party not involved in providing legal services, such as Ross Gow 
or Mark Cohen. See Egiazaryan, 290 F.R.D. at 431 (finding waiver of attorney-client privilege 
when the public relations firm participated in attorney-client communications: “[the party] has not 
shown that [the public relation’s firm’s] involvement was necessary to facilitate communications 
between himself and his counsel, as in the case of a translator or an accountant clarifying 
communications between an attorney and client’). 

Fourth, as explained in detail in Ms. Giuffre’s Motion to Compel (D.E. 33 at 12-14), the 
descriptions of the communications in the log are inadequate. Every single communication on the 
log, even those not involving any attorneys, is described as: “Communication re: legal advice.” 
These sparse and unvaried descriptions simply do not comply with Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(b)(5) and Local Rule 26.2(a)(2)(B), the former requiring that “the general subject 


matter of the communication” be stated in the privilege log. These bare bones descriptions do not 


provide sufficient information to support the privilege claims asserted therein, and obviously fail 
to provide Ms. Giuffre with any ability to challenge those assertions. 

Accordingly, this Court should find that Defendant has waived her privilege claim for 
every entry which describes the subject matter as “Communication re: legal advice,” or at the very 
least, require Defendant to submit the documents in question for in camera review to determine 
whether they are actually subject to any privilege claim. In addition, the Court should direct the 
production of documents on the privilege log that involve communications between the two non- 
lawyers. 

CONCLUSION 

This is a simple, straight-forward case that could stay on the Court’s imposed scheduled 

with a close of discovery in July, 2016 if the Defendant would simply comply in a timely manner 
with her discovery obligations. Since Defendant has refused to do so, Ms. Giuffre respectfully 
requests that this Court grant her Motions to Compel Production of Documents Subject to 
Improper Claim of Privilege and Improper Objections (D.E.’s 33 and 35), and require Defendant 
to produce the documents she is withholding for the time period of 1999 to the present, to produce 
the documents listed in her privilege log, or at the very least, conduct an in camera inspection to 
determine whether or not these documents are privileged.

New York, New York 10007 


Re: Ginffre v. Maxwell 
Case No, [5-cv-007433-RWS 


Dear Judge Sweet: 


We write today in response to Defendant Maxwell's March 2, 2016 letter and to ask the 
Court to compel the depusition of Defendant Maxwell on March 25, 2016. The discovery issue 
before the Court regarding Defendant Maxwell's deposition is straightforward, and the Court 
should order Maxwell to sit for her deposition. 


On February 25, 2016, Plaintiff Giufire first noticed Defendant Maxwell's deposition for 
March 2, 2016. Due to Detendant’s counsel's scheduling conflict, Plaintiff Giuffre tried to 
resolve the problem by re-noticing the deposition for March 25, 2016, a date for which she 
understood Maxwell and her counsel were available. Despite this, Defendant’s counsel refused 
to produce Maxwell for deposition unless Ms. Giuflre would respond “acknowledging [her] 
waiver of the right to take a second deposition based on the filing of the Answer and 
Counterclaims...Po reiterate, | have not accepted the date of March 25, 2016 for my client's 
deposition and will rot agree to schedule such a deposition in the absence of a protective order 
and your acknowledgment of a waiver as outlined above.” See Fixhibit A. Ms. Giulfre is 
simply trying to move discovery forward and respectfully requests that the Court direct Maxwell 
to sit for her deposition on March 25, 2016.' he issue is not “moot,” as Maxwell represented in 
her letter to the Court, because Maxwell is sull refusing to sit for her deposition until a Protective 
Order is entered. 


This is not the first time that Defendant Maxwell has attempted to avoid a deposition. In the civil actions involving 
Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, Maxwell represented she could not attend her deposition because she had to leave the 
county to care for her iH mother and did nol anticipate returning. Thereafter, she was photographed in the United 
States ata high profile wedding. See January 13, 2018 Daily Mailarticle, Bill CHaten pictured with Jeffrey 
Lpstein’s Social Fixer at Chelsea's Wedding AFTER Severing Links With Disgraced Pedophile.

Letter to Honorable Judge Robert Sweet 
March 3.2016 


Page 2 


The Court should also enter the Protective Order that Ms. Giuffre has recommended. In 
response to Maxwell's Protective Order demand, Plaintiff provided Maxwell's counsel with a 
full proposed Order, based on a few revisions to the Order that Maxwell had originally 
circulated. See Exhibit 13, February 26, 2016 Email Correspondence. ‘Those revisions 
reasonably provided necessary parameters to protect {rom averuse and abuse of the 
“confidential” designation. Rather than respond to Plaintiffs revisions, Maxwell filed with the 
Court a Motion for Protective Order and submitted her original Protective Order to the Court 
[D.E. 38]. Ms, Giuffre is not opposed to the entry of a Protective Order. Ms. Giultre, however. 
does ask that the Protective Order include specific language concerning the wpe of information 
to be protected and the method for challenging overbroad confidential designations to ensure that 
the Protective Order is not abused by the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre is setting forth her specific 
revisions in her Response to Defendant Maxwell's Motion for Protective Order, which will be 


filed shortly, 


Mnally, with respect lo Maxwell's concluding remarks, Ms. Giuffre first sent her request 
for Maxwell's deposition of February 5, 2016. To date, Maxwell has still not agreed to sit for 
her deposition. In contrast, on February 20, 2016, Maxwell's counsel requested dates for 
Plaintiffs deposition to take place in mid-April. Plainuff corresponded that she was conferring 
with her client regarding the proposed dates and would respond with a specific date. 


Accordingly, Plaintiff Giullre respectlully requests that the Court direct Maxwell to sit 
for her depasition on March 25, 2016. Yo the extent the Court is not able to resolve the 
Protective Order matter prior lo Maxwell's deposition on March 25, 2016, Plaintiff will agree to 
treat the entire transcript as confidential until such a time as the Court enters the Protective 
Order. A Proposed order to this effect is attached. See Exhibit C. Proposed Order Granting 
Plainiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition on March 25, 2016. Ms. Giufire also 
agrees to sit for her deposition in mid-April. alter Maxwell's deposition, ata date that is mutually 
convenient for the parties.

Southern District Of New York 


somelauabenacevevshaaelniusewbeuneswecnenuend Deus x 
Virginia L. Giuffre, 

Plaintiff, 
v. 15-ev-07433-RWS 
Ghislaine Maxwell, : 

Defendant. 
a ae ae a eee ie De 4 


DEFENDANT GHISLAINE MAXWELL’S RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS TO 
PLAINTIFF’S FIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 


Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby responds 
to Plaintiff's First Request for Production of Documents (the “Requests”). 


PRELIMINARY STATEMENT AND GENERAL OBJECTIONS 


I. This response is made to the best of Ms. Maxwell’s present knowledge, 
information and belief. Ms. Maxwell, through her attorneys of record, have not completed the 
investigation of the facts relating to this case, have not completed discovery in this action, and 
have not completed preparation for trial. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to Plaintiff's requests are 
based on information currently known to her and are given without waiving Ms. Maxwell’s right 
to use evidence of any subsequently discovered or identified facts, documents or 
communications. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to supplement this Response in accordance 
with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e). 


2. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they attempt to impose any 
requirement or discovery obligation greater than or different from those under the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the local rules of this Court or any Orders of the Court. 


2 Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, Rule 408 of the 
Federal Rules of Evidence, any common interest privilege, joint defense agreement or any other 
applicable privilege. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 44-3 Filed 03/07/16 Page 3 of 18 


4, Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek documents or 
information outside of Ms. Maxwell’s possession, custody or control. 


3 Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information which is 
not relevant to the subject matter of the litigation and/or is not reasonably calculated to lead to 
the discovery of admissible evidence. 


6. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying, embarrassing, or 
harassing Ms. Maxwell. 


7. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are vague and ambiguous, 
or imprecise. 


8. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information that is 
confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interests. 


9. Ms. Maxwell incorporates by reference every general objection set forth above 
into each specific response set forth below. A specific response may repeat a general objection 
for emphasis or for some other reason. The failure to include any general objection in any 
specific response does not waive any general objection to that request. 


10. The Requests seek information that is confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s 
privacy interests, To the extent such information is relevant and discoverable in this action, Ms. 
Maxwell will produce such materials subject to an appropriate protective order pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 26(c) limiting their dissemination to the attorneys and their employees. 


OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS 


11. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 1 regarding “Agent” to the extent that it 
purports to extend the meaning beyond those permissible by law. 


12. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 3 regarding “Defendant.” The Definition 
is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of the 
Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms. 
Maxwell or her counsel. 


13. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 5 regarding “Employee.” Ms. Maxwell is 
an individual, sued in an individual capacity, and therefore there is no “past or present officer, 
director, agent or servant” of hers. Additionally, “attorneys” and “paralegals” are not 
“employees” of Ms. Maxwell given that she herself is not an attorney and therefore cannot 
“employ” attorneys. 


14. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 9 regarding “You” or “Your.” The 
Definition is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 44-3 Filed 03/07/16 Page 4 of 18 


the Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms. 
Maxwell or her counsel. 


OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS 


15. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. |, in particular the definition of the 
“Relevant Period” to include July 1999 to the present, on the grounds that it is overly broad and 
unduly burdensome and calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action 
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Complaint at 
paragraph 9 purports to describe events pertaining to Plaintiff and Defendant occurring in the 
years 1999 ~ 2002. The Complaint also references statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell 
occurring in January 2015. Defining the “Relevant Period” as “July 1999 to the present” is 
vastly overbroad, irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible 
evidence, and as to certain of the Requests, is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or 
harassing Ms. Maxwell and it implicates her privacy rights. Thus, Ms. Maxwell interprets the 
Relevant Period to be limited to 1999-2002 and December 30, 2014 - January 31, 2015 and 
objects to production of any documents outside that period, except as specifically noted. 


16. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 3 on the grounds that it is unduly 
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell. 
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific disposition of documents, particularly electronic 
documents, dating back over 16 years. However, Ms. Maxwell, prior to this litigation has long 
had a practice of deleting emails after they have been read. 


Vi Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction Nos. 5, 8, 9, 12, 17 to the extent they seek to 
impose obligations to supply explanations for the presence or absence of such documents, to 
specifically identify persons or documents, to provide information concerning who prepared 
documents, the location of any copies of such documents, the identities and contact information 
for persons who have custody or control of such documents, the reasons for inability to produce 
portions of documents, and the “natural person in whose possession they were found,” beyond 
the requirements of Rule 34. These Instructions improperly seek to propound Interrogatories 
pursuant to Rule 33. 


18. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 13 on the grounds that it is unduly 
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell. 
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific circumstances upon which a document dating 
back 16 years has ceased to exist. 


19. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 15 to the extent that it calls for documents 
or information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or any other 
applicable privilege. 


20. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instructions Nos. 18 & 19 to the extent they require 
information on any privilege log above and beyond the requirements of Local Civil Rule 26.2.

INTRODUCTION' 

Plaintiff initiated this action purportedly in reaction to statements attributed to Ghislane 
Maxwell on January 3, and 4, 2015. The first of the two statements, according to Plaintiff's 
complaint, was issued by Ross Gow in the United Kingdom. The second was made by Ms. 
Maxwell in New York when she was accosted by reporters on the street. Both statements were 
brief, contained no factual content, and can best be described as general denials of allegations 
made by Plaintiff against Ms. Maxwell, to wit, that Ms. Maxwell “assisted” and participated in 
sexual abuse of the Plaintiff between 1999 and 2002. 

Plaintiff does not claim that any sexual abuse occurred after 2002 or that she had any 
contact with Ms. Maxwell after 2002. Indeed, according to Plaintiff, in 2002 she relocated, first 
to Thailand and then to Australia, where she married and started a family. Given that she has 
been thousands of miles away from the United States for more than a decade it is unlikely that 
Plaintiff has any personal knowledge about events involving Jeffrey Epstein after she left the 
country and broke off all contact with both Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. 

It would seem, then, that this lawsuit presents one relatively simple question: is 
Plaintiffs claim that she was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein between 1999 and 2002 “with 
the assistance and participation of” Ms. Maxwell true? 

Discovery that might be relevant to this relatively simple question could, theoretically, 
include the names of people that observed the Plaintiff from 1999 to 2002; records establishing 
the Plaintiff's whereabouts between 1999 and 2002; communications about the Plaintiff from 

' Ms. Maxwell previously submitted a joint response (Doc. #42) to Plaintiff's Motions to 
Compel in which she argues that Plaintiff's failure to confer prior to filing her motions is, alone, 
grounds for this Court to deny her Motions. If the Court is inclined, however, to decide 
Plaintiff's Motions on the merits, Ms. Maxwell hereby submits a response to the merits of 


Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents Subject to Improper Objections. This 
response is timely to Plaintiff's Motion, filed electronically on February 26, 2016. 


1 


1999 to 2002; and where Ms. Maxwell was located in relation to the Plaintiff during this time 
frame. Plaintiff, however, does not seem to be interested in her claim. Rather, Plaintiff’s 
pleadings are filled with other, more newsworthy and salacious allegations about which Plaintiff 
has no personal knowledge. And, because her core claim has no merit, Plaintiff like a remora, 
has repeatedly attempted to attach herself to these events that purportedly occurred while she was 
on another continent raising a family. 

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) provides, in relevant part, that "[p]arties may 
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of 
any party ....” 

Although the scope of discovery is deliberately broad, a Court is not "required to permit 
plaintiff to engage in a “fishing expedition’ in the hope of supporting his claim." McGee v. Hayes, 
43 Fed.Appx. 214, 217 (10th Cir. 2002) (unpublished opinion); see Tottenham v. Trans World 
Gaming Corp., No. 00 Civ. 7697 (WK), 2002 WL 1967023, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2002) 
("Discovery, however, is not intended to be a fishing expedition, but rather is meant to allow the 
parties to flesh out allegations for which they initially have at least a modicum of objective 
support") (quotations omitted); Hardrick v. Legal Services Corp., 96 F.R.D. 617, 618 
(D.D.C.1983) (courts should remain concerned about "fishing expeditions, discovery abuse and 
inordinate expense involved in overbroad and far-ranging discovery requests") (quotation 
omitted). "[B]road discovery is not without limits and the trial court is given wide discretion in 
balancing the needs and rights of both plaintiff and defendant." Gomez v. Martin Marietta Corp., 
50 F.3d 1511, 1520 (10th Cir.1995) (quotation omitted); see also Estee Lauder, Inc. v. 
Fragrance Counter, Inc., 189 F.R.D. 269, 273-74 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (J. Sweet) (“[W hile 


discovery rules are broad, they do not permit discovery of matters that are [not] relevant to the 


issues in the case...”). Although relevance in discovery is broader than that required for 
admissibility at trial, "the object of inquiry must have some evidentiary value before an order to 
compel disclosure of otherwise inadmissible material will issue." Zenith Electronics Corp. v. 
Exzec, Inc., No. 93 C 041, 1998 WL 9181, at *2 (N.D.III.1998) (quoting Piacenti v. Gen. Motors 
Corp., 173 F.R.D. 221, 223 (N.D.IIl.1997)). Courts have also recognized that "[t]he legal tenet 
that relevancy in the discovery context is broader than in the context of admissibility should not 
be misapplied so as to allow fishing expeditions in discovery." /d. (quotation omitted). 


ARGUMENT 


1. PLAINTIFF’S CHOSEN RELEVANT PERIOD FOR DISCOVERY IS GROSSLY 
OVERBROAD AND NOT REASONABLY RELATED TO HER CLAIM 


Plaintiff has not limited the temporal scope of her discovery requests. Instead, she 
demands production of various documents (or documents related to those documents) for the last 
17 years. Given the nature of the claim, the time period chosen by the Plaintiff is grossly 
overbroad. 

As instructed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 34, Ms. Maxwell objected to the 17-year time period and 
limited the requests to a more reasonable time frame: the period during which Plaintiff claims to 
have been abused and one month prior to the purported defamation. Plaintiff has offered no 
plausible explanation for her expansive time frame as discussed below. 

The gist of Plaintiff's temporal relevance argument is that, according to Plaintiff, Ms. 
Maxwell communicated or associated with Mr. Epstein after 2002 up to 2015. And, according to 
Plaintiff, Mr. Epstein was suspected of or committed a sex crime after 2002. Therefore, says 
Plaintiff, everything in that time frame is relevant. This is nonsense. Plaintiff, given her absence 
from the country, cannot argue that she was victimized during this time frame. Ms. Maxwell has 


never been charged with nor accused of any crime by a prosecuting body. Ms. Maxwell has 


3 


never been identified as an accomplice to any crime allegedly committed by Mr. Epstein; and 
Ms. Maxwell has never been the subject of a civil lawsuit for sexual abuse under any theory of 
liability. 

The relevant issue, as framed by Plaintiff's complaint, is did Ms. Maxwell assist or 
participate in Plaintiff's alleged sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein. General phone records, flight logs, 
or other documents having nothing to do with Plaintiff, who was in Australia, are simply too 
tangential and remote to be relevant even under the most broad definitions of relevance. 
Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell’s objection is well founded and should be sustained by the Court. 


Il. MS. MAXWELL’S SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS ARE PROPER 

Ms. Maxwell notes that all of Plaintiff's requests are fatally flawed as a result of her use 
of the phrases “all documents relating to” or “relating to” as part of her requests for production 
of documents. See, e.g., Requests Nos. 1, 3, 6,7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 22, 23, 24, 32 and 33. Where the 
phrase “relating to” is not employed, Plaintiff uses equally obtuse synonyms such as “reflecting” 
(Requests Nos. 34, 37) or “associated with.” (Request No. 21). 

“Relate” is a broad term. See, e.g., WEBSTER’S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY 1198 (2d Coll. 
Ed. 1986) (defining “relate” to mean, inter alia, “to connect or associate, as in thought or 


99 66. 


meaning; show as having to do with,” “to have some connection or relation (to),” and “to have 
reference (to)”). Courts have condemned the use of “related to” as overbroad and have refused 
to compel a responding party to answer discovery requests using the term. See, e.g., Meeker v. 
Life Care Ctrs. of Am., No. 14-CV-02101-WYD- NYW, 2015 WL 4400533, at *4 (D. Colo. July 
20, 2015) (denying motion to compel response to interrogatory that required identification of all 
documents that “relate to” drills or safety security training exercises “over a decade long span,” 


and holding that interrogatory was “facially overbroad, and potentially sweep[s] in incidents that 


are not proximate in location, time, and may not even be remotely of the “same type”); Avante 


4 


Int’l Tech., Inc. v. Hart Intercivic, Inc., No. CIV. 07-169-DRH, 2008 WL 2074093, at *3 (S.D. 
Ill. May 14, 2008) (“the court finds that the request to identify ‘all documents that refer or relate 
to each such person's contribution’ to be overbroad and unduly burdensome, and sustains the 
objection to that part of the interrogatory’’); In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., No. 04-MD-1616- 
JWL-DJW, 2008 WL 110896, at *1 (D. Kan. Jan. 8, 2008) (holding that a discovery request is 
overly broad and unduly burdensome on its face if it uses an “omnibus term” such as “relating 
to,” because “such broad language ‘make[s] arduous the task of deciding which of numerous 
documents may conceivably fall within its scope’”’); Roda Drilling Co. v. Siegal, No. 07-CV- 
400-GFK-FHM, 2008 WL 2234652, at *2 (N.D. Okla. May 29, 2008) (finding that “many of the 
parties’ requests for production of documents are overbroad, as they request ‘all documents' 
relating to or concerning a subject’), reconsideration denied in part, 2008 WL 3892067 (N.D. 
Okla. Aug. 14, 2008); Cotracom Commodity Trading Co. v. Seaboard Corp., 189 F.R.D. 655, 
665 (D. Kan. 1999) (holding that challenged discovery request was facially overbroad due to its 
use of the “omnibus phrase ‘relating to’”); Parsons v. Jefferson-Pilot Corp., 141 F.R.D. 408, 412 
(M.D.N.C. 1992) (“[b]road and undirected requests for all documents which relate in any way to 
the complaint are regularly stricken as too ambiguous’). 

And, Plaintiff has expanded the dictionary definition of “relate” in her definition section 
to make any attempt at deciding what documents might fall within the requests impossible. 
Because all of the requests suffer from this fatal defect the court should sustain the objection and 


deny the motion to compel. However, there is more. 


Til. EACH OF MS. MAXWELL’S OBJECTIONS IS APPROPRIATE 


1. Request No. 1: All documents relating to communications with Jeffrey Epstein 
from 1999-Present. 


This request unabashedly seeks any record of 17 years of “communications” with Jeffrey 
Epstein. If, for example, Ms. Maxwell wrote a note to herself that a mutual friend discussed a 
recipe for rice pudding with Mr. Epstein in 2013 this “document” would be subject to 
production. The request is not limited by subject matter and therefore encompasses everything. 
This is a classic fishing expedition calculated to annoy, and harass Ms. Maxwell. 

The rational for the request is particularly disturbing: Plaintiff, with no evidence other 
than her self-serving and contradictory statements states: “ Communications with convicted sex 
offender Jeffrey Epstein for whom Defendant Maxwell is alleged to have assisted with his sexual 
trafficking activities are of the highest relevance in this case and must be produced.” (PI.’s M. 
Compel at 9). That’s it. No evidence, just hyperbole. The request is not limited to 
communications about trafficking or even communications related to the Plaintiff. This 
stunningly overbroad request fails and Ms. Maxwell’s objection should be sustained. 


Z: Request No. 3: All documents relating to communications with Andrew Albert 
Christian Edward, Duke of York (a.k.a Prince Andrew) from 1999-present. 


Even more tangential than Request No. 1, this request ask for “all documents relating to 
communications” for 17 years with Prince Andrew. Again, the request is not limited by any 
subject matter or person. It is not limited to communications about the Plaintiff, it is not even 
limited to communications about females. The purported justification for this overbroad request 
is Plaintiff's unsupported claim that “Maxwell is alleged [by Plaintiff and no one else] to have 
trafficked Ms. Giuffre to Prince Andrew when she was a minor.” (Pl’s M. Compel at 10). 
Plaintiffs unsatisfactory explanation for this request is that it may, uncover “communications 


between them regarding her trafficking” and “possible” communications regarding other females 


6 


or other individuals “involved with this activity”. Ud.) The request, however, as propounded, 
asks for much more than is rationally related to that explanation. The use of the word “possible” 
reveals that this request is a classic, prohibited fishing expedition. The request is overbroad and 
Ms. Maxwell’s objection should be sustained. 
3. Request No. 6: All documents relating to communications with any of the 
following individuals from 1999 -the present: Emmy Taylor, Sarah Kellen, Eva 
Dubin, Glen Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, and Nadia Marcinkova. 

This request is also not limited by subject matter or person and is, actually, six separate 
requests for production of documents. As support for these overbroad requests Plaintiff attached 
a deposition transcript from a separate litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was not a party in which 
the witness, Sarah Kellen, asserts her right to remain silent. (/d. at 11). Plaintiff neglects to 
disclose that Ms. Kellen asserted her Fifth Amendment right to every question asked of the 
witness. She refused to answer basic questions such as her then current address (3.24.2010 Tr. at 
10); and what company she worked for as a model (id. at 97). There is no inference to be drawn 
from the, apparently unchallenged, assertions of privilege in an action that Ms. Maxwell was not 
a party and did not participate. There is no legal authority to support the claim that Ms. Kellen’s 
assertion of a privilege somehow spills over to become evidence relating to Ms. Maxwell. 

Plaintiff also attached partial documents purporting to be flight logs and phone records 
that, according to Plaintiff, establish communication with some of the listed individuals. Again, 
Ms. Maxwell’s reaction to this is “so what” because there is no nexus between any of this alleged 
evidence and Plaintiffs claims. Like the other requests the question is not reasonably targeted to 


obtain communications about the Plaintiff or even “sex trafficking.” 


4, Request No. 7: All video tapes, audio tapes, photographs or other print or 
electronic media relating to females under the age of 18 from the period of 1999- 
present. 

This request appears to cover books, DVDs, CDs, personal photographs and every other 
type of media that might “relate to” females under the age of 18. To respond to this request 
Plaintiff would apparently have Ms. Maxwell comb through her library to find literature “relating 
to” girls. A copy of the Nancy Drew series would be responsive to this request. Photographs of 
Ms. Maxwell as a child would be included. Any CD referencing a “girl” might be responsive. 
The list goes on and on. And, because Plaintiff failed to confer about this request before filing 
her motion to compel her self-imposed limitations are too little, too late. This request, as written 
is patently overbroad and the objection should be sustained. 

Further, the attached testimony from Mr. Rodriguez, again occurring in a proceeding to 
which Ms. Maxwell was not a party, lacks foundation and credibility. (Ud. at 12) It also, 
apparently, has nothing to do with the Plaintiff. 

a Request No. 8: All documents relating to your travel from the period of 1999- 
present, including but not limited to, any travel on Jeffrey Epstein’s planes, 
commercial flights, helicopters, passport records, records indicating passengers 
traveling with you, hotel records, and credit card receipts. ; and 

Request No. 33: All travel records between 1999 and the present reflecting your 
presence in: (a) Palm Beach Florida or immediately surrounding areas; (b) 9 E. 
71" Street, New York , NY 10021; (c) New Mexico; (d) U.S. Virgin islands; (e) 
any jet or aircraft owned or controlled by Jeffrey Epstein. 

Request Number 33 appears to be subsumed by the globally inclusive, unrestricted 
Request Number 8. Both requests fail in many ways. First, Plaintiff was living in another 
continent for the vast majority of the time covered by these requests. Plaintiff, by her own 


admission, was not traveling anywhere with Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein after 2002. It would be 


reasonable, then, to assume that none of the requested records would establish any nexus 


between Ms. Maxwell’s post-2002 travel and the events at issue in Plaintiff’s claim. If Plaintiff 
wanted records establishing her travel with Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that is what she should 
have asked for. Instead, she asked for every piece of information relating to Ms. Maxwell’s 
travel by planes, trains, automobiles, helicopters, boats, horses and bicycles. 

Read literally, Request Number 8 would require the production of 17 years of receipts for 
the purchase of gasoline at the neighborhood gas station, taxi receipts, lunch receipts, etc. for 17 
years. The only records not covered would be those relating to Ms. Maxwell’s residence, which 
unfortunately, is covered by another overbroad request, Request Number 34. Although slightly 
more limited, Request Number 33 remains impermissibly overbroad. Again, Plaintiff was not in 
the northern hemisphere after 2002 so could not have been in these places. Further, the phrases 


99 66. 


“immediately surrounding areas” “travel records” are impermissibly vague. 


6. Request No. 10: All documents relating to payments made from Jeffrey Epstein 
or any related entity to you from 1999 — present, including payments for work 
performed, gifts, real estate purchases, living expenses, and payments to your 
charitable endeavors including the TerraMar project. 

Request Number 10 is overbroad because it asks for, essentially, any document that 
relates to anything of value, no matter how small, given from Mr. Epstein to Ms. Maxwell (or 
their respective related entities) for 17 years. It is not targeted to any person, event, or job. The 
request could be interpreted in many ways and could include any financial, banking or 


accounting record compiled over a 17-year time frame. As such, the request fails and Ms. 


Maxwell’s objection should be sustained. 


oe Request No. 11: All documents relating to or describing any work you 
performed with Jeffrey Epstein, or any affiliated entity from 1999-present. 


Request Number 11 is unintelligible. Ms. Maxwell does not know what this request 
means and should not have to guess. Because the request is too vague to respond to the 
objection should be sustained. 

8. Request No. 15: All video tapes, audio tapes, photographs or any other print or 
electronic media taken at a time when you were in Jeffrey Epstein’s company or 
inside any of his residences or aircraft. 

This request is another obvious fishing expedition. It is not limited by person, place or 
time and apparently includes pre-1999 material. According to Plaintiff, she hopes that these 
records will contain the image of “other underage girls or trafficked women,” which, according 
to Plaintiff “go to the claim in this case”. (PIl’s M. Compel at 17). Again, Plaintiff was not, 
according to her complaint, involved with Mr. Epstein before 1999 or after 2002. Plaintiff does 
not articulate how this material might “go to the claim in this case” and, accordingly, Ms. 


Maxwell’s objection should be sustained. 


9. Request No. 17: All documents relating to communications with you and Ross 
Gow from 2005 — present. 


For the reasons stated repeatedly above, this request is also overly broad as there are no 
limitations for subject matter or person. Further, Plaintiff has offered no explanation as to the 
seemingly random time period of 2005 — present. 

More importantly, Ms. Maxwell has objected to this request on the grounds that it seeks 
documents protected by the attorney/client privilege and/or the work product doctrine. As 
discussed in her Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Response to Plaintiff's Motion to 
Compel Documents Subject to Improper Privilege, Ms. Maxwell’s withholding of these 


documents as privileged is proper. 


10 


10. Request No. 21: All telephone records associated with you including cell phone 
records from 1999 — present. 


Request No. 22: All documents relating to calendars, schedules or appointments 
for you from 1999 — present. 


Request No. 23: All documents relating to calendars, schedules or appointments 
for Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 — present. 


Request No. 24: All documents relating to contact lists, phone lists or address 
books for you or Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 — present. 


99 66 


These requests seek “all documents” “associated” with Ms. Maxwell’s phone records and 


99 66. 


“all documents” “relating to” “the schedules and address books” of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey 
Epstein for 17 years. Plaintiff, again, offers no coherent explanation as to how any of these 
records might relate to her claim, in this case, that she was defamed. Because of the excessive 


scope of the requests the objections should be sustained. 


11. Request No. 32: All documents related to communications with or interaction 
with Alan Dershowitz from 1999 — present. 


Here, Plaintiff is asking for information about communications with Alan Dershowitz for 
17 years. Plaintiff's only argument in support of this request is “Maxwell’s communications 
with Dershowitz are directly relevant to the claim.” (Pl’s M. Compel at 22). Perhaps Ms. 
Maxwell’s communications with Mr. Dershowitz about Plaintiff may be discoverable and even 
relevant. Any and all documents “relating to communications” are not. Accordingly, the 
objection should be sustained. 


2: Request No. 34: All documents reflecting your ownership or control of property 
in London between the years 1999 and 2002. 


Whether Ms. Maxwell owned or controlled property in London between 1999 and 2002 
is not relevant to any issue in this case. Plaintiff claims that a photograph of her when she was 


17 somehow establishes she was “trafficked”. She offers no actual explanation, however, for 


11 


how “documents reflecting” ownership or control of any “London” property is relevant or 
discoverable. The request is overbroad, not relevant, and the objection should be sustained. 

iL Request No. 37: All documents reflecting communications you have had with 

Bill or Hillary Clinton (or persons acting on their behalf), including all 
communications 

Whether or not Ms. Maxwell communicated with any member of the Clinton family is 
not relevant to any issue in this case. Again, Plaintiff asks for “all documents reflecting 
communications” for a 17-year time period. The only support for the request is Plaintiffs 
unsubstantiated claim that in an unrelated action Ms. Maxwell did not attend a deposition 
scheduled for July 1, 2010 because she had to attend to her mother. However, according to 
Plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell, 30 days later, attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton. Taking care of 
an elderly mother in England and attending a wedding ceremony are not mutually exclusive 
events. This, again, has nothing to do with any issue in this case and the objection should be 
sustained. 

13. Request No. 39: All documents reflecting training to fly a helicopter or 

experience flying a helicopter, including any records concerning your operation of 
a helicopter in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

Seventeen years of “all documents reflecting training to fly a helicopter “ are not relevant 
to any issue in this case. Plaintiff does not allege that Ms. Maxwell flew her to a private island 
by helicopter; she does not allege that she has personal knowledge of someone actually being 
flown by Ms. Maxwell to a private island for the purpose of “sexual trafficking of underage 


girls.” She simply demands 17 years of documents because she says they are relevant. The 


request is overbroad and not relevant and Ms. Maxwell’s objection should be sustained. 


12 


IV. PLAINTIFF’S FAILURE TO CONFER WITH MS. MAXWELL PRIOR TO 
FILING HER MOTIONS TO COMPEL IS DISPOSITIVE 


It is likely that a conferral could have minimized many of the issues described above. 


Accordingly in addition to the substantive problems with the requests, detailed above, Plaintiff's 


Motions to Compel should be denied for the reasons articulated in Ms. Maxwell’s separate 


response regarding the lack of any conferral (Doc. # 42) incorporated by reference.

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby submits this 
Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents Subject to Improper Claim 
of Attorney-Client Privilege and Common Interest Privilege’. For the reasons outlined below, 
the Court should deny Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents Subject to 
Improper Privileges. 

INTRODUCTION 

Without a single conferral (despite multiple email and telephonic contacts between 
counsel in the interim weeks), Plaintiff unilaterally and frivolously challenges the assertions of 
privilege properly contained on a valid privilege log that Ms. Maxwell produced in response to 
Plaintiff's First Request for Production of Documents to Ghislaine Maxwell. Plaintiff feigns 
ignorance that Ms. Maxwell has been represented by Messrs. Philip Barden, Mark Cohen and 
Brett Jaffe during the last five years, yet submits to the Court documents demonstrating not only 
their representation but also Plaintiff's knowledge of said representations. Plaintiff claims that 
the presence of Ms. Maxwell’s agent Ross Gow on communications with her attorney destroyed 
the privilege, despite binding New York law to the contrary. Plaintiff asserts that Ms. Maxwell 
and Mr. Epstein and their counsel were not in a common interest agreement without once having 
conferred regarding that fact and with knowledge that all of the elements of a common interest 


agreement are satisfied in this case. 


' Ms. Maxwell previously submitted a joint response (Doc. #42) to Plaintiff's Motions to 
Compel in which she argues that Plaintiffs failure to confer prior to filing her motions is, alone, 
grounds for this Court to deny her Motions. If the Court is inclined, however, to decide 
Plaintiff's Motions on the merits, Ms. Maxwell hereby submits a response to the merits of 
Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents Subject to Improper Privileges. This 
response is timely to Plaintiff's Motion, filed electronically on February 26, 2016. 


1 


Rule 37 requires a certification of good faith conferral, something Plaintiff concededly 
failed to do, in advance of filing a Motion to Compel. While Plaintiff wishes to pick and choose 
which Rules of Civil Procedure she thinks should apply to her litigation, the rules apply equally 
to both sides. Raising proper objections and interposing appropriate privileges are demanded by 
the Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff's hyperbole regarding “stonewalling” and un-reasonable 
delays in discovery should be dismissed. All of the delays could have been prevented had she 
served Requests for Production that tailored to the issues in this case and not some book or 
media deals she hopes to fulfill in the future. Likewise, her frivolous positions concerning 
privilege have caused the delay she decries. Plaintiff's failure to confer, as well as the binding 
Second Circuit and New York case law, dictate that her Motion to Compel Production of 
Documents Subject to Improper Privileges should be denied. 

ARGUMENT 
1. Failure to Confer Fatal to Plaintiff’s Motion 

Plaintiff failed to confer regarding this Motion in advance of its filing and failed to 
include the required certificate pursuant to Rule 37(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
(motion to compel “must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or 
attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an effort 
to obtain it without court action”). This significant deficiency alone warrants the denial of this 
Motion. See, e.g., Auto. Club of New York, Inc. v. Port Auth. Of New York & New Jersey, No. 11 
CIV. 6746 RKE HBP, 2012 WL 4791804, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2012) (failure to make any 
attempts to resolve any specific discovery disputes “alone is a sufficient ground for denying the 


motion [to compel]’’). 


Issues concerning privilege such as Plaintiff presents here are precisely the type that 
should be the subject of conferral. Plaintiff could simply ask whether any particular attorney was 
representing Ms. Maxwell at a specific time. Plaintiff could ask for more detailed descriptions of 
documents on the privilege log. Plaintiff could ask why British law was asserted on the privilege 
log. Indeed, all of the cases cited by Plaintiff involve such conferrals prior to judicial 
intervention. Such conferral would not be futile in this case with respect to privileges going 
forward and this Court should enforce Plaintiff's Rule 37 obligations with respect thereto. 

Il. Defendant’s Communications with Attorneys Philip Barden, Mark Cohen, and 

Brett Jaffe Are Protected by the Attorney-Client Communication Privilege (Entries 

1, 2, 9 and 17) 

A. Choice of Law 

Regarding Ms. Maxwell’s communications with Brett Jaffe in 2011 as noted on the 
privilege log, she does not dispute that these are covered by the attorney-client communication 
privilege as defined by New York state law. Mr. Jaffe is a New York attorney. Menninger Decl. 
at Ex. B. Similarly, Mark Cohen likewise is a New York attorney. /d. at Ex. C. Ms. Maxwell 
consulted both regarding litigation pending in the US. Jd. at Ex. E, Maxwell Aff. at { 9-12. 

However, choice-of-law with respect to foreign attorney-client communications 1s 
governed by the “touch base” test. Under this test, the court must ascertain the country with 


99 66 


which the communications “touch base.” “[A] court should apply the law of the country that has 
the predominant or the most direct and compelling interest in whether [the] communications 
should remain confidential, unless that foreign law is contrary to the public policy of this forum.” 
Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich Ltd., 982 F.Supp.2d 260, 264 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting Astra 
Aktiebolag v. Andrx Parms., Inc., 208 F.R.D. 92, 98 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)). “Communications 


concerning legal proceedings in the United States or advice regarding United States law are 


typically governed by United States privilege law, while communications relating to foreign 
legal proceedings or foreign law are generally governed by foreign privilege law.” Anwar, supra 
(citing Gucci Am., Inc. v. Guess ?, Inc., 271 F.R.D. 58, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)). 

As will be described more fully below, the privilege concerning Ms. Maxwell’s 
communications with Mr. Barden should be construed pursuant to British law. Ms. Maxwell, a 
dual-British / American citizen, retained Mr. Barden for the purposes of securing legal advice 
from a British lawyer for potential litigation in England under British law concerning press 
statements that were made in the British press. /d.at Ex. E. Likewise, to the extent that Mr. Gow 
was a participant in communications as between Mr. Barden and Ms. Maxwell, those also should 
be construed pursuant to British law. Mr. Gow is a British press relations specialist, hired as an 
agent consistent with British law, to render assistance to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel in England, for 
purposes of potential litigation in England. Jd. 

Given the time allotted for response in connection with this Motion to Compel 
Documents Privileges and Plaintiff's failure to confer regarding this issue, Ms. Maxwell has not 
had sufficient time to secure appropriate affidavits, documents and legal opinions concerning 
British law’s attorney-client privileges but has been advised that British law extends the 
attorney-client communication to any of a client’s agents (also considered “associates” of the 
client). Should the Court be inclined to overlook Plaintiff's failure to confer, Ms. Maxwell 
respectfully requests an additional two weeks within which to secure appropriate documentation 
and supporting affidavits under British law with respect to the question of the attorney-client 
privilege under British law and its applicability to a client’s agents. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1 
(permitting Court to consider “any relevant material or source” to determine issue of foreign 


law). 


Without waiver of the choice-of-law issue, Ms. Maxwell submits that the privilege also 
applies to her communications under New York law and so provides argument and authority 


herein on that law as well. 


B. Maxwell’s Communications with her Attorneys Are Privileged 
The two Requests for Production Implicated in this Motion are:” 


DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 17 
All documents relating to communications with you and Ross Gow from 2005 — present. 


DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 19 

All documents relating to your deposition scheduled in the matter of Jane Doe v. Epstein, 

08-80893, United States Southern District of Florida. 

As argued elsewhere, both of these Requests are overly broad and not relevant to any 
party’s claim or “proportional to the needs of this case.” FRCP 26(b)(1). Ms. Maxwell 
interposed her objections and also produced a privilege log containing any documents responsive 
to these requests which were privileged, specifically, documents covered by the attorney-client 
privilege. 

Ms. Maxwell has been represented at various times by attorneys Brett Jaffe, Mark Cohen 
and Philip Barden. Mr. Jaffe represented Ms. Maxwell in connection with a scheduled 
deposition. See Menninger Decl. at Ex. E, Maxwell Aff. at { 9. After Mr. Jaffe left the firm, his 
successor on the case was Mark Cohen. Both Mr. Jaffe and Mr. Cohen were affiliated with the 


law firm Cohen & Gresser, LLP. Mr. Cohen, a named partner, is still associated with that firm. 


See id. at Ex. C. 


* The entry number 9, a communication solely between Ms. Maxwell and her attorney 
Philip Barden, was erroneously placed on the Privilege Log. It is not responsive to any of 
Plaintiffs discovery requests. 


Ms. Maxwell also has been represented for quite some time in the United Kingdom by 
solicitor Philip Barden. Mr. Barden is a partner with Devonshires Solicitors. See Menninger 
Decl. at Ex. D. Devonshires Solicitors issued the cease and desist letter to the British press 
following Plaintiff's first paid interview with the Daily Mail in March 2011 in which she made 
false allegations about and concerning Ms. Maxwell. That cease and desist letter was attached to 
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (Menninger Decl. in Support of Motion to Dismiss, Doc. #16-1, 
Ex. B) and to Plaintiff's Reply (McCawley Decl. in Reply, Doc. #24-2, Ex. 2). 

Mr. Barden’s representation of Ms. Maxwell relates to potential civil litigation in the 
United Kingdom concerning defamation. Ms. Maxwell’s communications with Mr. Barden were 
made for the purpose of seeking and obtaining legal advice, and Mr. Barden provided such legal 
advice. Mr. Barden did not provide business advice to Ms. Maxwell. See Maxwell Aff. at {[ 2. 
Likewise, Messrs. Jaffe and Cohen’s representation of Ms. Maxwell related to and concerned a 
deposition. Jd. at { 9. Ms. Maxwell solicited legal advice from Messrs. Jaffe and Cohen for the 
purpose of that deposition and they in fact supplied legal advice. 

Plaintiff speculates that Ross Gow “was involved in so many communications with Jaffe 
and Barden” that the purpose of the communications must have been public relations matters. 
First, not a single one of the communications with Jaffe involved Mr. Gow. Second, the 
privilege log does not contain all of the communications Plaintiff had with her attorneys. Rather, 
Plaintiff's Request Number 17 sought “all communications related to communications with you 
and Ross Gow from 2005 — present.” Thus, the only communications with Mr. Barden on the 
privilege log are those between Mr. Gow and Mr. Barden in which Mr. Gow was a participant or 


which were otherwise included in other privileged communications. 


Plaintiff further complains that Defendant’s Rule 26 Disclosures revealed that Defendant 
“may” use the email communications between herself and Mr. Barden “to support Defendant’s 
claims or defenses.” (Pl.’s M. Compel at 11-12). Should Defendant choose to affirmatively 
waive her attorney-client privilege with Mr. Barden, those emails would likely lose their 
privileged status. However, that is not a decision Ms. Maxwell has yet reached, especially at this 
early stage of the litigation given she has not even filed her Answer or Counterclaims. 

C. Plaintiff Well Aware These Attorneys Were Defendant’s Counsel 

Plaintiff knew or should have known at the time she filed this Motion to Compel that Messrs. 

Jaffe, Cohen and Barden were Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys. In Plaintiff's Motion to Compel based 
on Improper Objections, she actually supplied to the Court an exhibit which lists Mr. Jaffe as 
Ms. Maxwell’s counsel. (Pl’s Mot. Compel - Objections, Ex. 8, Doc. #36-9 at 11). Likewise, 
Mr. Jaffe worked at Cohen & Gresser, LLP. Jd. The named partner of Mr. Jaffe’s firm is Mark 
Cohen, as a simple internet search confirms. Menninger Decl. at Ex. C. Thus, Plaintiff had in 
her possession and actually provided to the Court proof that Ms. Maxwell was represented by 
these two attorneys. Her assertion that Ms. Maxwell “has not even claimed that she has an 
attorney-client relationship with ... Jaffe” is patently frivolous. (Pl’s M. Compel at 10). 
Likewise, her designation of Mark Cohen as a “non-attorney” (id. at 9) is similarly frivolous. 

Further, Plaintiff submitted to the Court in Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, a cease 
and desist letter issued by Devonshires Solicitors, Mr. Philip Barden’s firm. See McCawley 
Decl. in Support of Plaintiff's Opp’n to Motion to Dismiss at Ex. 2. She also, admittedly, 
possesses Defendant’s Rule 26 disclosures listing Mr. Barden as counsel for Ms. Maxwell and 


his communications with her as attorney-client privileged. (Pl.s’ M. Compel at 11). 


Finally, Ms. Maxwell’s privilege log lists Mr. Barden and Mr. Jaffe as “Esq.” and notes 
their communications are attorney-client privileged. Plaintiff presents no credible argument that 
Ms. Maxwell’s communications with her counsel should not be afforded the attorney-client 
communication privilege. 

Plaintiff's Motion with respect to entry numbers 1, 2, 9 and 17 should therefore be 
denied. 


III. Communications Among Maxwell, Her Attorney, and Her Agent Protected by 
Attorney-Client Privilege (Entries 8, 10, 12, 13 and 18) 


Without waiver of Ms. Maxwell’s position that British law should control the question, 
even under New York law, Mr. Gow’s participation in communications among and between Ms. 
Maxwell and her counsel are privileged. 

“New York courts have recognized that the attorney-client privilege may attach to 
communications between a client's agent and an attorney.” Hendrick v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., 
Inc., 944 F. Supp. 187, 189 (W.D.N.Y. 1996). “As a general rule, a communication by a client 
to his attorney by any form of agency employed or set in motion by the client is within the 
privilege.” Mileski v. Locker, 178 N.Y.S.2d 911 (Sup. Ct. Queens Cnty. 1958); see also First 
Am. Commercial Bancorp, Inc. v. Saatchi & Saatchi Rowland, Inc., 868 N.Y .S.2d 425, 427 (4th 
Dep’t 2001) (“[w]hile communications made between a defendant and counsel in the known 
presence of a third party generally are not privileged, an exception exists for ‘one serving as an 
agent of either attorney or client’”); Stroh v. Gen. Motors Corp., 623 N.Y.S.2d 873, 874-75 (1st 
Dep’t 1995) (“communications made to counsel through ... one serving as an agent of ... [the] 
client to facilitate communication, generally will be privileged”’). 

Mr. Ross Gow is the agent for Ms. Maxwell, as Plaintiff acknowledges. Complaint {| 29 


(Maxwell “directed her agent, Ross Gow’’); ¥ 30 (“speaking through her authorized agent’’). 


8 


Plaintiff wrongfully relies on Egiazarayan v. Zalmayev, 290 F.R.D. 421 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) 
(Gorenstein, Magistrate J.). That case, unlike this one, involved a public-relations firm hired 
specifically for litigation purposes by counsel to conduct a litigation-related public relations 
campaign on behalf of the client. That public relations firm assisted in a media campaign 
thereafter, which was relevant to the lawsuit alleging violation of New York anti-SLAPP 
provision. The decision concerned a subpoena for documents that the client had shared with the 
public relations firm. Jd. at *4. 

By contrast, Mr. Gow acted as Ms. Maxwell’s agent for a number of years. Maxwell Aff. 
at J 6. He provided information to Mr. Barden, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel, at Ms. Maxwell’s 
request regarding press inquiries so as to further Mr. Barden’s ability to give appropriate legal 
advice to Ms. Maxwell regarding potential defamation litigation in the United Kingdom. As Ms. 
Maxwell’s agent, Mr. Gow’s involvement in providing Mr. Barden with information was 
necessary and critical for Mr. Barden to render proper legal advice concerning, among other 
things, the law of “fair comment” under UK law. Cf. In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated March 
24, 2003, 265 F.Supp.2d 321, 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“the ability of lawyers to perform some of 
their most fundamental client functions — such as (a) advising the client of the legal risks of 
speaking publicly and of the likely impact of possible alternative expressions, (b) seeking to 
avoid or narrow charges brought against the client, and (c) zealously seeking acquittal or 
vindication — would be undermined seriously if lawyers were not able to engage in frank 
discussions of facts and strategies with the lawyers’ public relations consultants.”). 

This case is particularly distinguishable from those relied upon by Plaintiff because the 
very nature of the issue in this case is defamatory statements to the press and responses thereto. 


Whereas public relations may not be an integral topic to other litigations (or potential litigations), 


the need for input from a client’s agent who is a press specialist is particularly potent when the 
issue is fair comment, litigation against the British press or the ability to respond to false 
statements levied by Plaintiff in the British press and elsewhere. In a scenario such as this, the 
press specialist agent is as integral to the discussion as an accountant is to a litigation that 
concerns a client’s finances. See United States v. Kovel, 296 F.2d 918 (2d Cir. 1961). 

Additionally, the communications among Mr. Gow, Mr. Barden and Ms. Maxwell 
occurred between January 9-21, 2015, a period which post-dates the issuance of Ms. Maxwell’s 
only statement to the press on January 2, 2015 (and the alleged reference back to that statement 
on January 4, 2015). See Complaint { 30, 31, 37. Plaintiff has not demonstrated that these post- 
press release documents are relevant, nor calculated to lead to relevant and admissible evidence.” 

Mr. Gow acted as Ms. Maxwell’s agent in communications to, with and among Ms. 
Maxwell and her attorney, Mr. Philip Barden on dates subsequent to the press release at issue 
here. His provision of information was a necessary part of Mr. Barden’s ability to give cogent 
legal advice to Ms. Maxwell concerning matters of litigation in the United Kingdom. To the 
extent that New York law even applies to those communications, it shields involvement of a 
client’s agent and Plaintiff's Motion with respect to entry numbers 8, 10, 12, 13 and 18 should 
therefore be denied. 


IV. Common Interest Privilege Protects Communications with Gow, Epstein and Others 
“The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to enable attorneys to give informed legal 


advice to clients, which would be undermined if an attorney had to caution a client about 





> Ms. Maxwell also objected to Request No. 17: “All documents relating to 
communications with you and Ross Gow from 2005 — Present” on grounds other than privilege, 
including inter alia, “calls for production of documents that are irrelevant to this action and not 
reasonably calculated to the discovery of admissible evidence.” Plaintiff did not assert in her 
Motion to Compel — Improper Objections that the period subsequent to the issuance of the press 
release was relevant (See Doc. #35 at 17-18) and thus has waived that argument. 


10 


revealing relevant circumstances lest the attorney later be compelled to disclose those 
circumstances.” Shaeffler v. United States, 806 F.3d 34, 40 (2d. Cir. 2015). “While the privilege 
is generally waived by voluntary disclosure of the communication to another party, the privilege 
is not waived by disclosure of communications to a party that is engaged in a ‘common legal 
enterprise’ with the holder of the privilege. Under United States v. Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237 (2d 
Cir.1989), such disclosures remain privileged ‘where a joint defense effort or strategy has been 
decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel ... in the course of an 
ongoing common enterprise ... [and] multiple clients share a common interest about a legal 
matter.’ Id. at 243 ‘The need to protect the free flow of information from client to attorney 
logically exists whenever multiple clients share a common interest about a legal matter.’ Jd. at 
243." (emphases added). 

As New York’s Appellate Division, First Department recently found, "pending or 
reasonably anticipated litigation is not a necessary element of the common-interest privilege." 
Ambac Assur. Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 998 N.Y .S.2d 329, 331 (1st Dep’t 2014). 
Moreover, “a total identity of interest among the participants is not required under New York 
law. Rather, the privilege applies where an interlocking relationship’ or a limited common 
purpose’ necessitates disclosure to certain parties.” GUS Consulting GMBH v. Chadbourne & 


Parke LLP, 858 N.Y.S.2d 591, 593 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Cnty. 2008) (internal citations omitted). 





* “The common interest privilege is an exception to the rule that the presence of a third 


party will waive a claim that a communication is confidential. It requires that the communication 
otherwise qualify for protection under the attorney-client privilege and that it be made for the 
purpose of furthering a legal interest or strategy common to the parties asserting it.” San Diego 
Gas & Elec. Co. v. Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., No. 150017/15, 2016 WL 634951, at 
*1 (1st Dep’t Feb. 18, 2016).

Importantly for purposes of this case, “[t]he joint defense privilege may apply as between 
two individuals within a joint defense effort, regardless of the presence of an attorney.” 
Millenium Health LLC v. Gerlach, 15-cv-7235 (WHP)(JLC), 2015 WL 9257444, at * 2 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2015). “If information that is otherwise privileged is shared between parties 
that have a common legal interest, the privilege is not forfeited even though no attorney either 
creates or receives that communication. For example, if an attorney provides legal advice to a 
client ... the client can repeat that advice to a co-defendant outside the presence of any attorney 
without causing the privilege to be waived.” Gucci Am., Inc. v. Gucci, No. 07-CV—6820 
(RMB)(JCF), 2008 WL 5251989, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2008). 


A. Maxwell and her attorneys were involved in a common interest agreement with 
Epstein and his attorneys. 


Beginning at least on December 30, 2014, Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys were engaged 
in a common interest agreement with Mr. Epstein and his attorneys. On that date, Plaintiff filed 
a pleading in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida falsely alleging that Ms. 
Maxwell participated in sex crimes against Plaintiff and others and also falsely alleged that Ms. 
Maxwell conspired with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein in sex crimes committed by him.” By her pleading, 
Plaintiff sought to join that Crime Victims’ Rights Act litigation pursuant to pursue a remedy: 
force the Government to withdraw its non-prosecution agreement against Mr. Epstein so that she 
could pursue charges against him and others, including Ms. Maxwell. Plaintiff's sworn pleading 
contained false statements about both Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein. 

Her pleading was unsuccessful: In April 2015, District Court Judge Marra struck the 


portions of her pleading having to do with Ms. Maxwell and others, denied Plaintiff the ability to 


Curiously, Plaintiff has not even provided this pleading which she references in 
Complaint under her Rule 26(a)(1) obligations. 


12 


join as a party to that case, and suppressed portions of her pleading from public access. Prior to 
that, in January 2015, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein both shared a common legal interest in 
defending themselves against Plaintiff's false allegations. The fact that neither Ms. Maxwell nor 
Epstein was a party to a litigation involving Plaintiff is immaterial to their shared legal interest. 
Ambac, 998 N.Y.S.2d at 331. Likewise, that common shared interest extended not only to their 
lawyers (Barden and Cohen for Maxwell; Weinstein and Dershowitz for Epstein), but also to Ms. 
Maxwell’s agent, Ross Gow, who had issued the January 2, 2015, press statement. 


B. Maxwell and Epstein’s attorneys communicated with one another pursuant to the 
common interest agreement (Entry 16). 


The attorneys orally engaged in to a common interest agreement and in reliance on that 
agreement, shared documents, legal advice, impressions and strategies with one another to 
facilitate their common goal of exposing Plaintiff's false statements. Entry number 16 on the 
privilege log reflects such communications between Plaintiffs attorney, Philip Barden, and 
Epstein’s attorney, Martin Weinberg on January 12-13, 2015. The emails’ subject lines read: 
“Attorney Privileged Communication — subject to mutual interest privilege,” and the contents 
include both attorneys’ mental impressions, references to evidence, litigation strategy decisions 
and the like. Indeed, the emails would not be responsive to any request made by Plaintiff but for 
the fact that Ms. Maxwell’s attorney forwarded the email chain to her and she forwarded it to 
Epstein, as discussed more fully below. 


C. Maxwell and Epstein shared their attorneys’ respective legal advice, strategies and 
mental impressions pursuant to the common interest agreement (Entries 11-15). 


Ms. Maxwell and Epstein forwarded to one another emails they had received from their 


respective counsel containing counsel’s mental impressions, legal advice and litigation strategy. 


e Entry number 11 is an email from Ms. Maxwell forwarding to Epstein (without 
comment) emails reflected in entries 12 and 13, that is, communications from her 


13 


own attorney, Mr. Barden, to her (as to which Mr. Gow was copied on one, and 
directed to Mr. Gow and copied to Ms. Maxwell as to the other). Mr. Barden 
provided in emails at entries 12 and 13, legal advice to Ms. Maxwell. 

e Entry numbers 14 and 15 likewise reflect emails on January 11 and January 13 
wherein (a) Epstein forwards to Ms. Maxwell a communication to and from his 
attorney (Alan Dershowitz in that case); (b) Epstein forwards to Ms. Maxwell a 
communication from his attorney (Martin Weinberg in that case) regarding 
Weinberg’s communications with Barden, and (c) Ms. Maxwell forwards to 
Epstein emails from her counsel, Mr. Barden, containing Mr. Barden’s legal 
advice and mental impressions. 

“Tf an attorney provides legal advice to a client ... the client can repeat that advice to a co- 
defendant outside the presence of any attorney without causing the privilege to be waived.” 
Gucci Am., 2008 WL 5251989, at *1; accord Millenium Health, 2015 WL 9257444, at * 2. 
Pursuant to their common interest agreement, Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein shared their 
lawyers’ advice to one another via email and thus “outside the presence of any attorney,” without 
causing their privilege to be waived. 

Plaintiff's Motion to Compel with Respect to entries 11-15 should therefore be denied. 


D. Maxwell and Epstein exchanged documents pursuant to the common interest 
agreement in order to obtain legal advice (Entries 6, 7 and 19). 


Similarly, Ms. Maxwell engaged in communications with Mr. Epstein reflecting 
exchanges of documents pursuant to the common interest agreement. As reflected at entries 
numbered 6 and 7, Ms. Maxwell requests of Mr. Epstein a particular document and then send a 
different document to Mr. Epstein (as well as his counsel, Mr. Dershowitz) of importance to their 
common interest in disproving Plaintiff's false allegations. 

Similarly, in entry number 19 as pertains to the January 21 email, Ms. Maxwell 
forwarded to Epstein a communication (entry number 18) received from her agent that was sent 


to Barden for purposes of obtaining legal advice. In the same way that sharing one’s lawyer’s 


14 


legal advice with a fellow member of the common interest agreement does not waive the 
privilege, nor does the sharing of documents. Gucci, supra (“Tf information that is otherwise 
privileged is shared between parties that have a common legal interest, the privilege is not 
forfeited even though no attorney either creates or receives that communication.”’). 


E. Ms. Maxwell and Epstein shared information and advice to be forwarded to the 
others’ attorney for purposes of legal advice (Entries 14, 19 and 20). 


Entry numbers 14, 19 and 20 contain some emails between Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein 
which reflect the sharing of their respective opinions, recollections, requests for information and 
advice. The purpose of these communications was to communicate information to be shared 
with their respective counsel for purposes of seeking and receiving legal counsel. These 
communications ought likewise to be privileged under the common interest agreement. “The 
need to protect the free flow of information from client to attorney logically exists whenever 
multiple clients share a common interest about a legal matter.” Shaeffler v. United States, 806 
F.3d 34, 40 (2d. Cir. Nov. 10, 2015) (quoting United States v. Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237 (2d 
Cir.1989) (“While the privilege is generally waived by voluntary disclosure of the 
communication to another party, the privilege is not waived by disclosure of communications to 
a party that is engaged in a ‘common legal enterprise’ with the holder of the privilege.”). 

Plaintiff's Motion to Compel as pertains to entry numbers 14, 19 and 20 that reflect 
communications between Ms. Maxwell and Epstein for purposes of sharing information with 
their attorneys should be denied as well. 


V. Ms. Maxwell’s Privilege Log Is Sufficient 


Finally, Plaintiff complains that Ms. Maxwell’s privilege log insufficiently describes the 


“subject matter” of the communications. Plaintiff cites three cases from the Southern District of 


15 


New York, describes them as “controlling precedent” and demands an in camera review of the 
subject documents. 

First, Ms. Maxwell’s privilege log satisfies the requirements of FRCP 26(c)(5) and Local 
Rule 26.2(a)(2). Local Rule 26.2(a)(2)(A) governs “documents”® and requires “(i) the type of 
document, e.g., letter or memorandum; (ii) the general subject matter of the document; (iii) the 
date of the document; and (iv) the author of the document, the addressees of the document, and 
any other recipients and, where not apparent, the relationship of the author, addressees, and 
recipients to each other.” Notably, the Local Rule exempts the requirements where “divulgence 
of such information would cause disclosure of the allegedly privileged information.” To have 
provided more detailed descriptions of the subject matter in this case would have revealed the 
privileged information contained within the documents and therefore the general descriptions are 
sufficient. 

Second, this type of issue is ripe for conferral among the parties in advance of court 
intervention. The three cases cited by Plaintiff are instructive. In Aurora Loan Servs., Inc. v. 
Posner, Posner & Assocs., P.C., 499 F.Supp.2d 475, 479 (S.D.N.Y. 2007), the privilege log did 
not indicate the nature of the privilege asserted nor the parties to the communications. 
Nevertheless, the parties engaged in conferral, after which additional documents and an amended 
privilege log were produced which still omitted key information. It was only then the magistrate 
judge found that the privilege had been waived. In S.E.C. v. Yorkville Advisors, LLC, 300 F.R.D. 
152, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), the privilege logs failed to include the identities of the parties, as well 


as the subjects of the communications. Over the course of nine months, the parties engaged in 





° Plaintiff erroneously cites to the requirements of Local Rule 26.2(a)(2)(B) which apply 
to “oral communications,” not relevant here. 


16 


several rounds of conferrals regarding the log, a pre-motion conference with the magistrate 
during which he found the log inadequate, and only then the requesting party sought leave to file 
a motion to compel. 

Finally, in Chevron Corp v. Donziger, 2013 WL 4045326 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), the court held 
that, while the document descriptions were insufficient, the log nevertheless contained the 
authors, recipients, dates and specified a privilege and so the proper remedy was to afford the 
withholding party the “opportunity to supplement his privilege log with descriptions of 
communications adequate to allow [his opponent] to assess whether the privilege is properly 
asserted.” Id at *3. Moreover, the complaint about the privilege log in that case arose after 
several rounds of motions to compel over the course of months. 

Ms. Maxwell’s privilege log complies with the Federal and Local Rules, any omitted 
information from the descriptions would have revealed the privileged information, and Plaintiff 
utterly failed to confer regarding any purported deficiencies. There is no ground for either 
finding a waiver of privilege or conducting an in camera review under these circumstances. 

CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell requests that Plaintiff's Motion to Compel 
Production of Documents Subject to Improper Claim of Privileges be denied. To the extent the 
Court is inclined to disallow Ms. Maxwell’s assertion of attorney-client privilege with respect to 
communications with British solicitor, Mr. Philip Barden, Ms. Maxwell requests an Order 
permitting two weeks additional time to secure affidavits and other materials pertinent to British 
law concerning attorney-client privilege, including its protection for agents of the client. 

Alternatively, Ms. Maxwell requests the Court to hold the Motion in abeyance until such 


time as the parties have actually met and conferred regarding the Motion’s contents.

ACUITY Reputation 


Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria . 
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have 
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 


Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and 
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having 
sexual relations with her, which he denies. 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as 
they are defamatory. 


Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same. 
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British 
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old 


defamatory claims.

securities, shareholder and derivative litigation; corporate control and M&A litigation; and real estate

Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine 
Maxwell 


BY DEVONSHIRES SOLICITORS, PRNE 
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2011 


LONDON, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the 
various allegations about her 

that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations 
are all entirely 

false. 


It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell's legal 
representatives to certain newspapers pointing out the truth 
and asking for 

the allegations to be withdrawn have simply been ignored, 


In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take 
legal action against those newspapers. 


"I understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is 
well known that certain newspapers live by the adage, "why 
let the truth get 

in the way of a good story." However, the allegations made 
against me are 

abhorrent and entirely untrue and | ask that they stop,” said 
Ghislaine 

Maxwell, 


"A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of 
accuracy 

in their reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the 
most 

elementary investigation or any real due diligence. Iam now 
taking action to 

clear my name," she said,

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria 
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have 
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 


Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and 
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having 
sexual relations with her, which he denies. 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as 
they are defamatory. 


Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same. 
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British 


press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old 
defamatory claims.

INTRODUCTION 


Plaintiffs response to a routine request for a plain vanilla protective order is both 
disturbing and revealing. It is disturbing because Plaintiff incorrectly and disingenuously 
attempts to re-cast the history of discovery issues in this case to support her equally disingenuous 
“non-protective” order. Revealing, because the “non-protective” order proposed by Plaintiff 
exposes her true motives: First, her continued desire to use this Court and the discovery process 
to promote her fantastical story to the media; second, her tactical plan to bully potential 
witnesses into silence by inappropriate threat of criminal prosecution. The Court should reject 
the “non-protective” order proposed by Plaintiff and enter the reasonable, and enforceable, order 
submitted by Ms. Maxwell. 

The True Facts 

Plaintiff, on February 4, 5 and 12, 2016, unilaterally and without conferral noticed a 
number of depositions in Florida and New York to occur shortly after the notices were served. It 
would have been obvious to any experienced trial lawyer that it was unlikely, given the short 
time frame, lack of notice, and significant travel, that opposing counsel would not be available 
on dates chosen without conferral in contravention of this Court’s Local Rule 26.4. Not 
surprisingly, Counsel for Ms. Maxwell was unavailable on the dates unilaterally selected by 
Plaintiff. 

Counsel for Ms. Maxwell attempted to have a professional conversation about an orderly 
discovery plan and, contemporaneously with that request, on February 12, suggested that the 
parties present a stipulated motion for protective order to the Court. Counsel for Ms. Maxwell 
received no response to this request and, accordingly, on February 20, sent a draft of a protective 


order to Plaintiff. This draft was, at first, ignored. When pressed, Plaintiff provided a revised 


protective order that contains traps and loopholes rendering it meaningless. Thus, Ms. Maxwell 
was forced to file her request for a protective order with the Court. 

Ms. Maxwell has a real need for a protective order in this case. Plaintiff and her counsel 
have made numerous statements to the media about Ms. Maxwell and others. Plaintiff, in this 
matter, has repeatedly attached transcripts from unrelated matters, news articles about public 
figures, material obtained from government investigations, and discovery obtained in other cases 
to her hyperbolic pleadings. These attachments appear to be directed at the media as they have 
no real relation to any issues before the Court. The attachments are simply a mechanism to make 
information available to the media in the hope of generating publicity. Likewise, and in 
contravention of this Court’s Practice Standards 1(A), Plaintiff attaches correspondence between 
counsel while misrepresenting the facts relating to those communications. 

The Law 

Under Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure any party may move the court, 
for good cause shown, for a protective order regarding pretrial discovery “which justice requires 
to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or 
expense.” Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(c). “Although the Rule contains no specific reference to privacy or to 
other rights or interests that may be implicated, such matters are implicit in the broad purpose 
and language of the Rule.” Seattle Times Company v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 35 (1984). 

Confidentiality orders are intended “to “secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive 
determination’ of civil disputes by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence that might 
conceivably be relevant.” Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 295 (2d Cir. 1979). 
Unless protective orders are “fully and fairly enforceable,” persons relying upon such orders will 


be inhibited from providing essential testimony and information in civil litigation, “thus 


undermining a procedural system that has been successfully developed over the years for 


disposition of civil differences.” Id. 


ARGUMENT 


I. PLAINTIFF’S PROPOSED ORDER IS INADEQUATE AND CONTRARY 
TO FED. R. CIV. P. 26 


A. The Proposed Opening Paragraph and the Purposes and Limitations 
Paragraph are Based on False Premises 


The “Opening Paragraph” of Plaintiff's proposed protective order falsely claims that she 
is a victim, other witnesses are victims, and Ms. Maxwell is a perpetrator. Thus, according to 
Plaintiff, the language of a standard, neutral, protective order must be changed to accommodate 
only those claiming to be victims and not those falsely accused. Plaintiff cites no authority for 
this proposal which is inapposite to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 and the law of this Circuit. It is a regular 
practice for courts to include language in protective orders that protect the interests of parties and 
witnesses who may be accused of crimes. See, e.g., Martindell, supra; United States v. Parcels 
of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 1990) (acknowledging that the district court had entered a 
protective order prohibiting the use of the claimant's “deposition transcript, interrogatory 
answers and affidavit in any criminal proceeding brought against him by the United States 
Attorney for the District of Massachusetts,” with certain exceptions); Securities and Exchange 
Commission v. Gilbert, 79 F.R.D. 683, 687 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (ordering the SEC “not to furnish 
the U.S. Attorney specially with any information procured in the course of discovery in this 
case’). Protective orders can also serve as “an accommodation to defendants that are entitled to 
assert their Fifth Amendment rights in a civil lawsuit involving the government.” United States v. 
Hines, 110 A.F.T.R.2d 2012-6363, 2012 WL 5182910, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 17, 2012). The 


Eastern District of New York discussed “the intersection of a court's power to issue a protective 


2 


order prohibiting the use of discovery obtained in a civil litigation in other proceedings, and a 
party's constitutional right to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege ....” Jd. at *3. The court held, 
in part, that the magistrate judge had not erred by issuing a protective order “despite the potential 
burden it may place on the government's ability to bring parallel civil and criminal proceedings 
ones AG, AL? TY, 

Plaintiff quibbles with the language describing the information to be protected, claiming 
that it is “overbroad.” This language, however, is not Defendant’s creation, it is taken almost 
verbatim from Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1) which states: “The court may, for good cause, issue an 
order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden 
or expense....” 

Plaintiff proposes a Purposes and Limitations revision to include a “good faith” 
certification. Counsel for Ms. Maxwell understand their professional obligations under the Rules 
of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Professional Conduct. They have and will act pursuant to 
those rules. No such provision is needed to regulate the conduct of Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers. 

B. The Proposed Changes to Paragraph 3 are Unnecessary 

Plaintiff takes exception to the use of the word “implicates” and substitutes “covered by” 
and then proceeds to provide her own definition of “covered by” which cannot be found in any 
dictionary. In fact, use of the colloquial phrase “covered by” is imprecise and subject to many 
interpretations as the word “covered” has, depending on the dictionary, 13 to 14 definitions 
including defining a sexual act between horses. See, e.g. “Cover,” Merriam-Webster Online 
Dictionary, 2015 ed., available at www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cover (last accessed 
March 9, 2016); see also “Cover,” Cambridge Dictionaries Online, 2016 ed., available at 


dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/English/cover (last accessed March 9, 2016). Implicates, 


on the other hand, is easily understood and means: to involve as a consequence, corollary, or 
natural inference. “Implicate,’” Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2015 ed. 

Plaintiff wants to add the phrase “or any non-party that was subject to sexual abuse.” 

The obvious question raised by this proposal is: According to whom? Will the parties be able to 
challenge the claim of the non-party that the individual was “subject to sexual abuse.” The 
protective order proposed by Ms. Maxwell covers this problem by allowing either party to 
designate information as confidential. Under Ms. Maxwell’s proposal if the Plaintiff wanted to 
designate the information of a non-party as confidential she could, without any “sexual abuse” 
qualifier. 

GC. The Proposed Changes to Paragraph 4 Gut the Protective Order 

Paragraph 4 provides: “Confidential information shall not be disclosed or used for any 
purpose except the preparation and trial of this case.” Plaintiff suggests adding: “and any related 
matter, including but not limited to, investigations by law enforcement.” The use of the slippery 
phrase “and any related matter, including but not limited to” makes any order meaningless. With 
this language Plaintiff would be free to claim anything is a “related matter” and disseminate 
confidential information to anyone. 

As discussed above, protection from government investigations is a valid and “vital 
function” of a protective order under F.R.C.P. 26(c). Martindell, supra, at 295. Given that the 
allegations relating to Plaintiff's claims, depending on the version, occurred over a decade ago, 
the likelihood of any prosecution related to Plaintiff, as an alleged victim, appears unlikely. 
However, Plaintiff seems to want the specter of some theoretical prosecution to hang over this 
case as a scare tactic. A witness adverse to Plaintiff would be reluctant to testify and may be 
bullied into asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid the potential of information being 


forwarded to a prosecutor by the Plaintiff or her lawyers. 


7 


D. The Proposed Changes to Paragraph 5 Make the Order Unenforceable 


Plaintiff proposes to dilute the enforceability of the order by adding the following to the 
list of people who can lawfully possess the information: “(h) any person (1) who authored or 
received the particular Protected Material; (2) who has or had at any point in time access to the 
Protected Material outside of the context of this action; or (3) for which there is a good faith 
basis to conclude that the individual has earlier received or seen such Protected Material; and (j) 
any other person by written agreement of the parties or by Order of a Court of competent 
jurisdiction.” 

Proposed subjection (h)(1) seems to apply to anyone who is the recipient of the Protected 
Material. Thus, an email or postage stamp renders the order meaningless. Plaintiff’s (h)(2) 
makes it virtually impossible for an aggrieved party to enforce the order because the person in 
possession of the Protected Material simply has to claim that they, at any point in time, “had 
access to” the Protected Material. “Access to” is a very broad term. A burglar has “access to” 
an unprotected house. A hacker has “access to” an unprotected computer. Simply because 
someone has “access to” something does not confer the right to have it. And, it would be time 
consuming, expensive, and likely futile to attempt to prove when someone did, or did not, have 
“access to” the material. 

Subsection (h)(3) further muddies Plaintiff's murky swamp of disclosure. If Plaintiff or 
her lawyers have a “good faith basis to conclude” that someone has either “received” (and 
apparently not looked at) or “seen” (which would imply receipt followed by viewing) Plaintiff or 
her lawyers can disseminate Protected Material to that person. Seemingly, if either Plaintiff or 


her lawyers are tricked by someone in the press or otherwise and have a “good faith” but 


mistaken “basis to conclude” that the reporter has at some time “received” or “‘seen” the material 
they are free from sanctions. 


E. Adopting the Proposed Changes to Paragraph 11 Would Make the 
Disclosure Process Cumbersome and Unpredictable 


As originally proposed, paragraph 11 provides for a very straightforward and predictable 
process: a party designates information that she deems confidential as such; the other party can 
object, in writing, to the designation. If the parties can resolve the disagreement within 10 days 
it is resolved without Court intervention. If not, it is incumbent on the objecting party to file a 
motion asking for the Court’s assistance in resolving the matter. 

Plaintiff's proposal, however, allows an unlimited amount of time to object to a 
confidentiality designation. Invariably, this will lead to some attempt to game the process by 
delaying the objection process. Moreover, if something is designated as confidential and the 
parties rely on that designation it would be inappropriate to then, potentially months after the 
fact, litigate the designation. This proposal results in sloppy work and an unreliable process. In 
addition, Plaintiff in her proposed paragraph 11 has injected a new category of designation, 
“highly confidential-attorneys’ eyes only.” It is unclear why this designation would apply in this 
case and this designation, if appropriate, should be subject to a different, more individualized 
process. And, the “highly confidential” documents are not referenced in paragraph 12. 
Presumably these types of documents would be destroyed at the conclusion of the case. 


F. Proposed Paragraph 13 Adds Another Layer of Unnecessary 
Uncertainty 


Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective order does not limit any party’s ability to restrict 
documents. Accordingly, should Plaintiff or Ms. Maxwell believe that a non-party’s deposition 


contains confidential information either party is free to designate it as such. If neither of the 


parties believed that the information should be afforded confidential treatment it makes no sense 
for a non-party to, apparently at any time, request confidential treatment. If a non-party has a 
particular interest that is inconsistent with that of the parties they are free to request a separate 
protective order that addresses that concern. 


G. Proposed Paragraph 14 Should Be Subject to a Reasonable Time 
Limitation 


Ms. Maxwell does not object to the addition of a provision that allows either party to 
claw back documents inadvertently not designated as Confidential. However, without any 
restriction as to the time each party has to exercise this right, the burden on the receiving party of 
“undertaking best efforts to retrieve all previously distributed copies from any recipients now 
ineligible to access the Protected Material” can become unreasonably onerous. Ms. Maxwell 
thus proposes that paragraph 14 be modified to require that the producing party be given a 
reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days, to claw back any inadvertently undesignated 
document. 

H. Paragraph 15 Fails for the Same Reasons as Paragraph 5 

Paragraph 15 is a restatement of Plaintiff's proposed changes to paragraph 5 and fails for 
the same reasons. 

CONCLUSION 

The Orders of a United States District Court Judge should be understandable and 
enforceable. The language proposed by Plaintiff renders the Protection Order neither. The 
Protective Order offered by Ms. Maxwell is neutral, understandable, and enforceable. It is the 


type of order routinely entered in U.S. District Courts and should be entered in this case.

Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, respectfully submits this Reply in Response to Defendant’s 
Supplemental Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Compel the Production of Documents Subject to 
Improper Objections [D.E. 45]. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should grant Ms. 
Giuffre’s Motion to Compel in its entirety. 

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT' 

After sitting on Ms. Giuffre’s First Request for Production for four months, Defendant 
only produced two documents. Defendant acknowledges that she has other responsive 
documents, but she is withholding them from production.” 

Flight logs demonstrate the incredibly close relationship between Defendant and 
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein during the time they were abusing Ms. Giuffre and, then, 
other minors: Defendant flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane no less than 360 times, and over 
20 times with Ms. Giuffre when Ms. Giuffre was a minor child.?- Message pads from Law 
Enforcement’s trash pull of Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion show Maxwell in regular 
contact with him, including Defendant arranging for Epstein to meet with underage girls. This 
evidence alone rebuts Defendant’s specious objections that seeking documents relating to 
Defendant’s trafficking of other underage girls is merely a “fishing expedition.” Indeed, over 


thirty underage girls were recruited for Epstein’s sex abuse, most of which were recruited after 


' Ms. Giuffre views Defendant’s “Supplemental Responses” (D.E. 45 and 46) as impermissible sur-replies. 
Defendant already filed a Response, and her “supplemental” responses were filed after Ms. Giuffre filed her Reply 
to Defendant’s Response. See In re A2P SMS Antitrust Litig., 972 F. Supp. 2d 465, 500 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (striking 
sur-reply because it does not respond to “new issues which are material to the disposition of the question before the 
[C]ourt,”); Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich Ltd., 982 F. Supp. 2d 260, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“the Court notes that 
Plaintiffs’ letter is a sur-reply filed without permission of the Court and does not identify new controlling law, and 
therefore will not be considered.”). To the extent that this Court has not yet made a sua sponte ruling to strike them 
from the docket to date, Ms. Giuffre hereby files her reply briefs within the time allotted under the Local Rules. 


* She is also adamantly refusing to sit for her deposition. Most recently, Defendant is attempting to hold hostage Ms. 
Giuffre’s effort to take Defendant’s deposition by refusing to agree on a basic privilege log production parameters 
unless Ms. Giuffre agrees to cancel the most critical deposition in this case — that of the Defendant.

Ms. Giuffre escaped.’ Therefore, discovery requests concerning Defendant’s continued 
trafficking of minors, and continued contact with her co-conspirators (including payments from 
Epstein), are relevant and discoverable. 


Il. ARGUMENT 


A. Ms. Giuffre’s Relevant Period Is Appropriate 


1. Defendant is Taking a Disingenuous Position Regarding Her Objections to 
Plaintiff's Time Period 


Defendant argues that, “[g]iven the nature of her claim, the time period chosen by the 
Plaintiff [17 years] is grossly overbroad.” (See D.E. 45 at 3.)°. However, Defendant’s own 
document requests belie this contention. Defendant requested documents from an even greater 


period of time, and many requests have no date restrictions (“NDR”) whatsoever:

For example, Defendant’s Request No. 26 seeking “All Documents concerning any 
prescription drugs taken by You,” has no date restrictions. Defendant, therefore, must believe 


that every prescription drug Ms. Giuffre has taken - from infancy - will likely be helpful to prove 


* See Declaration of Sigrid McCawley (“McCawley Decl.”) at Exhibit 1, Palm Beach Police Report. 


> Defendant disregarded Ms. Giuffre’s requested date range of 1999 to the present and unilaterally limited her 
production to the years 1999 — 2002 and for one month from December 31, 2014 to January 31, 2015. 


or disprove the claim in this case.° Defendant cannot hold the position that documents relevant 
to the claim in this case arise solely from a self-serving fraction of the requested date range if 
collected from her, while concomitantly holding the position that documents from an even larger 
date rage are relevant when collecting from Ms. Giuffre. With her briefing in one hand, and her 
requests for production in the other, Defendant is engaging in double-speak. Accordingly, this 
Court cannot take Defendant’s argument regarding the Relevant Period at face value, and should 
reject it. 

Zs Ms. Giuffre’s Post-2002 Discovery Requests Are Narrowly Tailored To 


Seek Specific, Relevant Evidence Of Defendant’s Continued Involvement 
In Jeffrey Epstein’s Underage Sex Trafficking 





As articulated in Ms. Giuffre’s moving brief and her consolidated reply (D.E. 35, and 
43), Ms. Giuffre has shown the relevance of her narrowly-tailored requests seeking certain 
documents from the period of time after Ms. Giuffre escaped Defendant’s abuse. To recount, 
Defendant continued to recruit underage girls for sex with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein 
after Ms. Giuffre escaped.’ This fact is established by documentary evidence, sworn testimony, 
and other statements by third parties. Indeed, flight logs show Defendant traveling on the 
convicted sex offender’s plane up to at least 2005; and police reports in the Palm Beach 
investigation reveal the abuse occurred into the mid-2000s.* In addition, message pads from law 
enforcement trash pulls from Jeffrey Epstein’s home show that Defendant arranged to have 


underage girls come over for “training.” 


° Despite issuing multiple requests like the one quoted above, Defendant’s “Supplemental Response” brief 
complains of a “fishing expedition” by Ms. Giuffre seven times. 


’ Indeed, over thirty underage girls were recruited for Epstein’s sex abuse. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1. 

* See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2, Flight Logs from Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane and Exhibit 1, Palm Beach 
Police Report. 

” See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Message Pads from Law Enforcement trash pulls of Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm 
Beach home. 


Documents showing Defendant recruiting underage girls from that time period are 
relevant because they help establish Ms. Giuffre’s contention that Defendant recruited her while 
she was underage. Again, over thirty underage girls were recruited for Epstein’s sex abuse in 
Florida alone, most of which were recruited after Ms. Giuffre escaped.'° Such documents would 
show a pattern and practice of Defendant’s behavior and also show Defendant’s role within 
Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal enterprise. That Ms. Giuffre was in Australia while Defendant 
continued her illegal activities does not lessen the weight of that evidence.'! To the contrary, the 
fact that Defendant and Jeffrey Epstein recruited other girls for abuse gives more weight to Ms. 
Giuffre’s allegations. 

Furthermore, for the period after Epstein was indicted for sex crimes against children, 
documents showing Defendant’s continued communications with Epstein and his associates, 
documents showing receipt of payments from Epstein, and documents showing her attempts to 
cover up her wrongful sexual abuse of minors are relevant. 

There are already materials implicating Defendant’s post-2008 involvement with Epstein 
and the related cover-up. For example, Defendant dodged a deposition in 2009 to avoid 
answering questions about the abuse of Ms. Giuffre and others.'” Additionally, since 2005, when 
the investigation started, to the present, Defendant has been engaged in a joint defense agreement 
with Jeffrey Epstein.'> And, Defendant has continued to communicate with convicted sex 


offender Jeffrey Epstein, at least, through 2015, when she made her defamatory statement.'* 


'° See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1. 


'l “Tf it be that defendant has violated the provisions of law, and continues so to do, there is no good reason why the 
plaintiff may not produce evidence of defendant's continuing wrongful conduct.” Civil Aeronautics Bd. of Civil 
Aeronautics Auth. v. Canadian Colonial Airways, 41 F. Supp. 1006, 1008 (S.D.N.Y. 1940). 

'? See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4, Notice of Deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell, Subpoena and Cancellation 
Payment Notice, and January 13, 2015 Daily Mail Article. 

'° See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 5, January 12, 2016 Deposition Transcript of Alan Dershowitz at 527; see also 
March 7, 2016 Affidavit of Ghislaine Maxwell, attached at Exhibit E to D.E.47-S. 


'4 This is evidenced by Defendant’s privilege log, McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6. 


Documents evidencing these acts and occurrences after Epstein’s indictment show her continued 
involvement in the conspiracy. 

Defendant states that “this lawsuit presents one relatively simple question: is Plaintiff's 
claim that she was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein between 1999 and 2002 ‘with the 
assistance and participation of Ms. Maxwell true?” (D.E. 45 at 1). She cannot claim that 
evidence of her involvement in Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of other girls, after 2002, does not tend to 
prove the allegations that Defendant was involved in the abuse of Ms. Giuffre.'> In short, 
evidence of Defendant trafficking other girls, and evidence of Defendant covering up the abuse 
after the fact, is relevant to proving that she was involved in the abuse and trafficking of Ms. 
Giuffre. Defendant has admitted she has responsive documents for this period. Therefore, this 
Court should direct that she produce them. 

B. Defendant’s Objections Are Improper 

Defendant’s argument against Ms. Giuffre’s use of the phrase “all documents” or 
“relating to” is disingenuous because she uses those phrases in her requests to Ms. Giuffre. 
Defendant argues that the terms, “all documents” and “relate,” are too broad to be employed in 
Requests for Production, thus making all of Ms. Giuffre’s requests “fatally flawed.” At the same 
time she makes this argument, Defendant has propounded 37 requests for production on Ms. 
Giuffre. Twenty-five of them seek “all documents” or “any documents.” Twenty of them seek 
documents “relat[ing] to” or “reflecting” various topics. Only 8 of her 37 requests are free of 
these “obtuse” terms that she claims are “fatal defect[s].” Presumably, Defendant is neither 


conceding that the majority of her Requests for Production are “fatally flawed,” nor is she 


'S Accordingly, Defendant’s objections to Request Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, and 27 are improper. 


withdrawing the 29 of them. Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre respectfully requests the Court reject this 


argument. 


C. Defendant’s Specific Objections Are Inappropriate 


1. Request No. 1: All documents relating to communications with Jeffrey 
Epstein from 1999-Present. 
Request No. 10: All documents relating to payments made from Jeffrey 
Epstein or any related entity to you from 1999-present, including 
payments for work performed, gifts, real estate purchases, living expenses, 
and payments to your charitable endeavors including the TerraMar 
Project. 
Request No. 11: All documents relating to or describing any work you 
performed with Jeffrey Epstein, or any affiliated entity from 1999-Present. 


Jeffrey Epstein’s message pads, pulled from trash by law enforcement, show that 


Defendant arranged for a minor child to come over to Jeffrey Epstein’s house for “training”. ’ 


The Palm Beach Police Department collected these incriminating message pads from Epstein’s 
home. A member of Jeffrey Epstein’s household staff, Juan Alessi, testified under oath that 
Defendant lived with Epstein, and ran his household.'* These are just some examples of 
evidence showing that Defendant was employed by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to 
traffic minor children for him. 

Despite this evidence, Defendant claims that discovery requests seeking evidence of work 
she performed for Epstein, the payments she received from Epstein,’ and the communications 
she had with and about Epstein, constitutes a “fishing expedition.” (D.E. 45 at 6.) These 


requests are not merely “reasonably calculated” to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, 


'° Tn discovery disputes, “[w]hat is good for the goose is good for the gander.” In re 650 Fifth Ave., No. 08 CIV. 
10934 KBF, 2013 WL 1870090, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2013) (requiring that the government produce a privilege 
log in order to persist in its allegations that the defendants’ privilege logs are inadequate). 


'’ See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Message Pads from Jeffrey Epstein’s house. 

'S See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 7, Deposition Transcript of Juan Alessi. 

"" Indeed, substantial payments received from Epstein at key times during the Government investigation can show if 
he paid her in exchange for her silence. Evidence of Epstein (or Epstein’s attorney, see McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 
8, February 2, 2015 Page Six Article) paying for her New York home (recently listed at $19M), and evidence of 
Epstein’s continued payments throughout the Relevant Period, are also indicative of Maxwell’s ongoing 
involvement with Epstein. 


but they zero-in on exactly the type of admissible evidence that would directly support Ms. 
Giuffre’s claim of being sexually abused. 

Defendant argues she should not have to produce communications related to Jeffrey 
Epstein and “rice pudding.” Ms. Giuffre disagrees. Communications revealing Defendant’s 
frequent and constant contact with Epstein, particularly regarding the minutia of his life, shows 
the depth of her access to, and involvement with, Epstein. Indeed, frequent communications 
showing how Defendant was the intimate caretaker of Epstein’s private life - from rice pudding 
recipes to his predilection for underage girls - reveal her role as a participant in the trafficking 
and, importantly, thoroughly refute any affirmative defense she might make that she was 
unaware of the abuse. 

2; Request No. 3: All Documents Relating To Communications With 
Andrew Albert Christian Edward, Duke Of York (A.K.A Prince Andrew) 
From 1999-Present. 

Ms. Giuffre has alleged that Defendant trafficked Ms. Giuffre to Andrew while she was a 
minor child. Ms. Giuffre has a photograph of Andrew’s arm around her bare waist in the 
presence of Defendant, in Defendant’s London apartment, while Ms. Giuffre was under age. 
Defendant has never answered the question: what was this child doing in her London townhouse 
with them? Another witness has supplied some of the details on Ms. Giuffre’s trafficking to 
Andrew. Johanna Sjoberg reported that “Virginia, another girl there, sat on a chair and had the 
puppet on her lap. Andrew sat on another chair, I sat on his lap and he put his hand on my 
breast. Ghislaine puppet’s hand on Virginia’s breast, then Andrew put his hand on mine. . .”.”° 
Accordingly, communications with Andrew are relevant, and they would likely show 


Defendant’s arrangements to traffic Ms. Giuffre to him, and possibly the trafficking of other girls 


to him. 


°° See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 9, September 23, 2007 Red Ice Creations Article. 


3 Request No. 6: All Documents Relating To Communications With Any 
Of The Following Individuals From 1999 -The Present: Emmy Taylor, 
Sarah Kellen, Eva Dubin, Glen Dubin, Jean Luc Brunel, And Nadia 
Marcinkova 


Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege when 
asked under oath about Defendant’s involvement in trafficking underage girls.”! For example, 
co-conspirator Nadia Marcinkova testified: 


Q. Isn’t it true that yourself, Ghislaine Maxwell and Sarah Kellen had access to a master 
of list of underage minor females names and phone numbers so they could be called for 
the purpose of coming to Jeffrey Epstein’s house to be sexually molested? . . . 

A. Fifth... . 

Q. And also typical of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein to prostitute or pimp out 
underage minors to friends? . . . 

A. Fifth. 


Co-conspirator Jean Luc Brunel left a note for Epstein on a message pad saying he had a

sixteen-year-old girl who could “teach Russian” to Epstein for “free. 
is photographed with Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein on a trip to Europe with Ms. Giuffre when she 
was a minor, and the Dubins are on flight logs with Defendant and Epstein.”* Therefore, the 
communications with these individuals are relevant, and show the sexual trafficking. 
4. Request No. 37: All Documents Reflecting Communications You Have 
Had With Bill Or Hillary Clinton (Or Persons Acting On Their Behalf), 
Including All Communications 
Defendant has a history of avoiding deposition in relation to sex abuse claims. In 2009, 
Maxwell’s deposition was sought in connection with various sexual abuse allegations. Maxwell 


avoided her deposition, claiming her mother was ill, so she would be traveling outside the 


country with no plans of returning. Despite this claim to avoid her deposition, she was

question in her deposition. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 11, March 24, 2010 Deposition Transcript of Sarah 
Kellen. 


°° See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 10, April 13, 2010 Deposition Transcript of Nadia Marcinkova at 34 and 48.

photographed shortly thereafter in the United States at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, 
New York.”* Most recently, when Ms. Giuffre attempted to meet and confer on the procedure 
for the production of her privilege log, Defendant refused to reach any agreement relating to the 
procedural issue unless Ms. Giuffre would cancel the Defendant’s deposition. 

Further, other communications Defendant has had with the Clintons about Ms. Giuffre or 
the allegations in this case are also highly relevant, particularly given that former President 
Clinton travelled with Defendant, Jeffrey Epstein and others on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane a number 
of times, including a trip to Thailand. Maxwell admits that she has documents responsive to this 
request, and this Court should require her to produce them. 

2 Request No. 7: All Video Tapes, Audio Tapes, Photographs Or Other 
Print Or Electronic Media Relating To Females Under The Age Of 18 
From The Period Of 1999-Present. 
Request No. 15: All video tapes, audio tapes, photographs or any other 
print or electronic media taken at a time when you were in Jeffrey 
Epstein’s company or inside any of his residences or aircraft. 

Regarding Request No. 7, Alfredo Rodriguez, Epstein’s former house manager, testified 
that Defendant kept naked pictures of girls on her computer.*° As explained in her moving brief, 
Ms. Giuffre is not seeking mainstream, legally available depictions of minors. She is seeking the 
photos described by Mr. Rodriguez and any other (non-family) under-age girls, including Ms. 
Giuffre, photographed or otherwise recorded by Defendant. Regarding Request No. 15, media 


depicting individuals in Epstein’s company or inside his residences or aircraft are relevant to Ms. 
y 


Giuffre’s claims that she was trafficked to others.

°° See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 13, Deposition Transcripts of Alfredo Rodriguez. 


6. Request No. 17: All Documents Relating To Communications With You 
And Ross Gow From 2005 — Present. 


Defendant’s defamatory statements to the press were issued by Ross Gow, and it is the 
genesis of this action. Accordingly, requests seeking Defendant’s communications with Gow are 
reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Additionally, Ms. Giuffre only seeks 
documents from Ross Gow from 2005 - present, because Defendant had not been publically 
implicated in an underage sex trafficking ring prior to 2005. Therefore, any other 
communications with Mr. Gow prior to that time are irrelevant. 

£6 Request No. 8: All Documents Relating To Your Travel From The Period 
Of 1999- Present, Including But Not Limited To, Any Travel On Jeffrey 
Epstein’s Planes, Commercial Flights, Helicopters, Passport Records, 
Records Indicating Passengers Traveling With You, Hotel Records, And 
Credit Card Receipts. 
Request No. 33: All Travel Records Between 1999 And The Present 
Reflecting Your Presence In: (A) Palm Beach Florida Or Immediately 
Surrounding Areas; (B) 9 E. 71st Street, New York , NY 10021; (C) New 
Mexico; (D) U.S. Virgin Islands; (E) Any Jet Or Aircraft Owned Or 
Controlled By Jeffrey Epstein. 
Request No. 39: All documents reflecting training to fly a helicopter or 
experience flying a helicopter, including any records concerning your 
operation of a helicopter in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

These requests seek information about Defendant’s sexually trafficking of minors, 
including documents relating to her flying girls to be with Epstein.”’ Related to the trafficking, 
Epstein’s Caribbean property is only reachable via helicopter or boat, and Defendant’s records of 
transporting underage girls or other individuals to that property are relevant to Ms. Giuffre’s 
claims of Defendant’s sexually trafficking her. 


CONCLUSION 


Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion to Compel. 


*7 Ms. Giuffre is in possession of some of Epstein’s private aircraft flight logs, but they are incomplete.

Plaintiff,

GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 15-cv-07433-RWS 
Defendant.

ANSWER 


Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through her attorneys Haddon, Morgan & Foreman, P.C., 


answers the Complaint as follows: 


Introduction 

1p Ghislaine Maxwell did not participate in, facilitate, manage or otherwise conspire 
to commit sex trafficking as alleged by Plaintiff Virginia Roberts Giuffre (“Giuffre”). Giuffre’s 
unsubstantiated allegations concerning Ms. Maxwell are false. Giuffre’s fantastical claims, 
contained in news stories and press-releases masquerading as legal pleadings over the last five 
years have been well-crafted with the assistance of high-priced attorneys to facilitate Giuffre’s 
media exposure, to enhance her marketability, to extract financial gain for herself and her family, 
and to promote her sham non-profit, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc. 

Be No law enforcement agency pursued any criminal charges against Ms. Maxwell, 


even after both federal and state investigators fully scrutinized Ms. Maxwell’s one-time 


employer, Jeffrey Epstein, who was jailed for soliciting underage prostitution. No court or jury 
has ever determined Ms. Maxwell responsible for any criminal conduct against Giuffre or 
anyone else. No civil complaint has ever been lodged against Ms. Maxwell for sexual 
misconduct nor abuse nor has she settled privately any private claims for such. Indeed, no other 
person has ever made any claim of any sort against Ms. Maxwell. 

3. Rather, Giuffre fabricated a story of abuse at the hands of Ms. Maxwell in 
exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars from British tabloids with a motive for selling 
papers and advertisements and without regard for truth, veracity or substantiation. The more 
time that passes and the more potential for monetary gain she and her attorneys perceive, the 
more Giuffre’s story, like Pinocchio’s nose, continues to grow without limitation: more and 
more famous people, more lurid accounts of tawdry sexual encounters, and more exploitive 
circumstances. Giuffre’s stories have proven wildly contradictory and, even by her own words, 
have been definitively proven untrue. 

4, Giuffre published her false allegations and accusations about Ms. Maxwell in 
tabloids and in media interviews and then in press-releases disguised as legal pleadings which 
she shared with the press. Faced with unrelenting negative press and harassment by the media in 
the United Kingdom spurred by Giuffre’s false claims, Ms. Maxwell was obligated by British 
law to set the record straight and to defend herself by issuing a denial of Giuffre’s claims about 
her and pointing out that her more fantastical stories contained obvious lies. 

5. Giuffre filed this defamation action against Ms. Maxwell for financial and media 
gain and for her 15 minutes of fame. Ms. Maxwell submits this Answer to Giuffre’s 
unsubstantiated Complaint in order to seek vindication from Giuffre’s vicious lies and improper 


abuse of this country’s judicial system.

24. Plaintiffs claims may be barred by the statute of limitations. 

25. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the “single publication” rule. 

20. Plaintiffs claims are barred because the statements made by Ms. Maxwell or her 


agent (if any) were constitutionally protected opinions. 


Zi Plaintiffs claims are barred in whole or in part by the United Kingdom’s 
Defamation Act of 2013. 

28. Plaintiffs claims are barred because the statements made by Ms. Maxwell or her 
agent (if any) were non-defamatory statements of fact. 

29. Plaintiffs claims are barred because the statements made by Ms. Maxwell or her 
agent (if any) were protected by the self-defense privilege.

37. To the extent Plaintiff suffered an injury, she failed to take reasonable, necessary, 
appropriate and feasible steps to mitigate her alleged damages, and to the extent of such failure 


to mitigate, she should be barred from recovering some or all of the alleged damages she seeks.

existing medical and mental conditions of Plaintiff, and/or causes that occurred without 
knowledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell and for which Ms. Maxwell is not responsible. 

39. Plaintiff's damages, if any, were the result of her own conduct or the conduct of 
others and were not proximately caused by any action of Ms. Maxwell.

On 03/14/2005, I received a call from a woman who did not wish to 
identify herself (later identified as MMMM). She stated 
that her fourteen year old step daughter (later identified as 
quip) possibly may have been molested in Palm Beach by a wealthy 
man. According to @QRMMMe, she learned of the possible molestation 
by a third party. She explained that she had received a call from the 
mother of her stepdaughter's friend. The mother claimed to have 
overheard a conversation between her daughter and a male friend; they 
were talking about @§§MM The conversation was about how i had met 
with a 45-year-old man and had sex with him and was paid for it. I 
advised that I would like to meet with her to obtain a more 
detailed statement and facts. QQQMMMMMR stated she did not know what 
to do and had to discuss the matter with her husband. At this point 

did not provide me with a call back number or any other 
information. She stated that she would contact me once she had spoken 
with her husband and ggg mother. 


On 03/14/2005 received a call from Mr. & Mrs. mmr = They stated 
it was all right to speak to their daughter WM via cell phone qm

They agreed to meet me at the police department later this date. 






On 03/14/2005, Mr. 2 eee accompanied by his wife jit, 
came to the Palm Beach Police Department where they advised 
me that they believed their fourteen year old daughter may have had 
some type of sexual relationship with an older male who resided in

facility during the week and comes home on the weekend. According to 


she was admitted to the school because of disciplinary 
problems that recently escalated. The facility also coordinates with 
the families to provide one on one as well as family counseling. 


According to Mrs. @@@MMMMMMM, she believes the incident occurred on 
Sunday, Feb 6, 2005. A friend of named Haley picked her up at

with the older gentleman, though they do not have any proof. Haley 
lives close by with her mother. Mrs, further explained that

Robson drove @ii——~£t, along with the unknown female to Palm Beach. 
Sometime on the way there, a conversation occurred between Robson and

interview them and expect the investigation to remain confidential. 


Because of the time delay, there was no need for the victim to be 
taken to a medical facility for a physical for the purpose of

with Sgt. Szarszewski who removed the bags from the well and placed 
them into one large black trash bag. The bag was returned to the 
Police Station where I was waiting for him. Upon his arrival, we 
inspected the bags where several notes and papers were found. These 
notes contained names of girls with times. Additionally, there was a 
note from agi and Laura to Jeffrey Epstein on a notepad, which 
stated,"For a good time call qm and Laura at SM." Also, 
there was another telephone number on the note GM Also found 
was a written note, which stated, @@Mmm can not come at 7 p.m. 
tomorrow because of soccer. These items were written on notepads that 
contain Jeffrey Epstein on the bottom of the notes. These items were 
placed into evidence for future follow up. I requested subpoenas for 
subscriber information on the telephone numbers listed above on the 
note from! and Laura. The cellular telephones QB and 
are both assigned to Cingular Cellular Service. Other notes 
were found within the trash on Jeffrey Epstein pad, papers that 
contained telephone numbers. One note had with 
written on it. This cellular number is assigned to Cingular Cellular 
Service. Another sheet had written QM which is assigned to Bell 
South Telecommunications. The subpoenas were picked up and submitted 
to Cingular and Bell South Telecommunication for subscriber 


information. 


On September 22, 2005, I was informed by Sgt. Szarszewski that there 
would be no trash pick up as it was recycle pick up day. A request 
for copies of the micro and standard size cassettes were requested 
from crime scene to familiarize myself with the interviews conducted. 


On September 23, 2005, the tapes were received and I began to become 
familiar with the interviews that were conducted. Det. Krauel had met 
with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation worker, Jeff Williams and observed 
him enter the property of 358 El Brillo. Shortly thereafter, Williams 
exited the property and placed the three white trash bags in the empty 
well in the rear of the truck. Williams then drove away where he met 
with Det. Krauel who removed the bags from the well and placed them 
into one large black trash bag. The bag was returned to the Police

the bags where several notes and papers were found. The notes will be 
inspected for future use. The items collected were placed into 
evidence. 


It became evident that some of the recordings were recorded with 
background noise and some interference. The calls most affected were 
the control phone calls from the victim to the suspect Haley Robson. 
I obtained the graphic equalizer and discovered that the calls are 
able to be legible with the use of the equalizer by lowering the 
background noise and increasing voice gain. I also learned that a 
tape was broken during the coping of the tape. I returned the copy of 
the tape marked Property Number 05-243 to have it recopied to have an 
original in evidence and a working copy with the file. 


Upon researching the file, it was discovered that the suspect, Haley 
Robson's cellular calls were subpoenaed incorrectly. The suspect 
telephone number was 561-308-0282 and the original request was for 
561-908-0282. I requested the information through Cingular Cellular 
Service from February 2005 through the present. The purpose was to 
have a record of Robson making calls to victim, Jeffrey Epstein and 
the frequency of calls. Tha .request was submitted to the State 
Attorney's Office.

I met with Det. Krauel and requested further assistance to maintain 
trash collections at Epstein's residence at 358 El Brillo Road. on 
October 3, 2005, at approximately 10:30 am, I was contacted by sgt. 
Frick to respond to the Palm Beach Police Station. Det. Krauel had 
observed Jeff Epstein riding his bicycle on South County Road. Upon 
my arrival, I met with Sgt Frick who advised, as Epstein was currently 
in Town; we interview Haley Robson as to her involvement with Epstein 
and the girls that are brought to his house. As we were to interview 
Robson in the county, (outside of our jurisdiction), I contacted the 
State Attorney s Office Investigation Division, and made contact with 
Assistant Supervisor Investigator Carlos Ortiz. I requested 
assistance to interview Robson as the interview may occur in the 
county. Supervisor Ortiz assigned Investigator Mike Waites to assist 
us at the location and interview of Robson. 


Det. Dicks had responded to the address of Robson and viewed her 
vehicle parked in the driveway. Robson's vehicle a red Plymouth Neon 
baring Florida Tag of H49-PKB was parked in the driveway of 12247 72nd

Upon Robson s entry in the unmarked Detective vehicle, I placed a tape 
recorder within the vehicle to record any conversations within the 
vehicle. During the ride back to the police station, Robson advised 
she is attending Palm Beach Community College at the Palm Beach 
Gardens Campus and is majoring in journalism. 


Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the 
interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to Robson that IT 
appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should 
she desire to leave at any time she may do so. I further explained 
the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she 
understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how 
she came in contact with Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 
17 years of age she was approached by a friend Molly in the Canopy 
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach, Robson was asked if she wanted to make 


money . 


She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make 
$200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with 
Jeffrey. Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) 
picked her up and she was taken to Epstein's house. Upon her arrival 
at the house, she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the 
house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as 
Sara. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff 
Epstein s bedroom. Sara arranged the massage table and covered the 
table with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them 
next to the massage bed. Sara then left the room and informed her 
Jeff would be in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a 
towel. He lay on the table onto his stomach and picked Massage oil 
for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated, He tried 
to touch me and I stopped him. I asked how he tried to touch her. He 
grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated 
Epstein has a vibrator, which is large and white in color. Robson 
told Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson 
stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the 
massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I 
know you re not comfortable, but I'll pay you if you bring some girls. 
He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to 
bring a 23-year-old female and Epstein stated that the female was too 
old. Robson was asked how many girls she brought in total to Epstein. 
Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she brought 
imp and the victim in this case. 





I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised the victim 
was the youngest. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to 
expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a 
massage, possibly naked, and some touching. I asked her if the victim 
was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. 

She explained she knew the victim wanted to make money. She

of the front exterior of Epstein's residence. At 3:00 p.m., I set up 
a surveillance vehicle equipped with a video monitoring device. The 
surveillance vehicle was parked on El Brillo Way approximately fifty 
feet east of Epstein's driveway. The purpose of the video 
surveillance was to gather investigative intelligence by monitoring 
and recording all vehicle and pedestrian traffic entering and leaving 


Epstein's property. 


The video surveillance tapes were changed daily with a new Maxell 
T-160 VHS tape. Video surveillance was established for Epstein s from 
March 31, 2005 through April 05, 2005. On April 05, 2005, video 
surveillance was concluded. I reviewed the video tapes and advised 
Detective Pagan the surveillance videos yielded no evidentiary value.

collect Epstein s trash, I observed a white female, who I recognized 
as Nada Marcinkova from her Florida driver's license photograph. I 
made no contact with Marcinkova. While parked in the area, I also 
observed Epstein s GMC Yukon truck leave the property as well as other 
vehicles arrive and park across the street from the property. The 
occupants of these vehicles appeared to be housekeepers, maintenance 
men, and gardeners. 


At 9:38 a.m., I met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee, 
Jessie Jones. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo 
Way and collect the trash from Epstein s property. I followed Jessie 
to a predetermined area at which time I collected the trash bags from 
the sanitation truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation 
department, where I sifted through its contents. I collected mail 
correspondences addressed to Jeffrey Epstein, automotive records and 
personal documents for Janusz Banasiak and Beata Banasiak as well as 
Jeffrey Epstein notepaper with the names and appointment times for

appeared to be a broke piece from a sexual toy similar to a (Cyclone 
Vibrator) possibly used for rectal gratification. The sexual object 
was photographed for Detective Pagan, packaged in a biohazard evidence

investigation for evidentiary purposes. 


On April 06, 08, 11, 12, 13, 15, 2005, at approximately 9:30 a.m, I 
met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employees. I observed the 
employee enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash 
from Epstein's property. I followed the employee to a predetermined 
area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation 
truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department, 
where I sifted through its contents. 


All of the documents collected from Epstein's trash during my 
assistance were turned over to Detective Pagan for evidentiary 


purposes. 


On June 14, 2005, Detective Michelle Pagan contacted me and advised 
that the airplane belonging to Jeffrey Epstein of 358 El Brillo Way 
was parked at the Palm Beach International Airport. 


Detective Pagan requested that I begin trash pulls for the purpose of 
gathering evidence and intelligence. 


I made contact with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation Office Supervisor 
Tony Higgins and requested trash pulls for 358 El Brillo Way to begin 
on June 15, 2005. 


On June 15, 2005, I met with a sanitation employee. I observed the 
employee enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo Way and collect the trash 
from Epstein s property. I followed the employee to a predetermined 
area at which time I collected the trash bags from the sanitation 
truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation department, 
where I sifted through its contents. The trash yielded negative 
results and no evidence was collected. 


No further trash was collected throughout the week due to the fact 
that Epstein s security gates remained closed throughout the week; 
therefore, the sanitation employees were unable to gain access onto 
the property for collection of the trash.

On October 12, 2005, Det. Dawson and I traveled to the Orlando area 
and made telephone contact vith as ‘ agreed to meet 
with us as we were in the Orlando area. GQ Provided directions to 
her apartment. Det. Dawson and I met with who stated, during a 


Sworn taped statement that nothing happened between her and Epstein, 
appeared nervous during the interview. I assured her that I 
had spoken with other people who advised differently. GMM stated 
she only went a couple of times and provided a massage to Epstein. 
She stated she was brought to the Epstein house in March of 2005, 
brought her to work. Gilli bas no formal training in 
providing massages. GUN stated she provided a massage, fully 
clothed for $200.00. As I sensed hesitancy in her answers, I asked 
if she had been contacted by anyone from the house. 
Stated she was interviewed already by an investigator for Epstein. He 
met with her on October 8, 2005, at a Roadhouse in Orlando, He 
identified himself as Paul and inquired about the police investigation 
and left his telephone number 305-710-5165 for additional contact. 
provided no additional information, as it appeared her 
responses were almost scripted. We left the area and returned to Palm 
Beach Police Department. 


Based on the information acquired during the interviews, a search 
warrant was prepared for entry at the Epstein home. On October 18, 
2005, I met with Judge Laura Johnson who reviewed the warrant request. 
She found there was sufficient probable cause and signed the warrant 
request. On October 20, 2005, at approximately 9:36 am, members of 
the Palm Beach Police investigations Unit executed the search warrant 
at 358 El Brillo in Palm Beach. Members of the Investigations Unit 
included Capt Gudger, Sgt Frick, Det. Dicks, Det. Dawson, Det. 
Melnichok, Det. Sandman, Det. Krauel, the crime scene unit and myself.

As we entered onto the property, we encountered the house manager, 
Janusz Banasiak who was in the guest portion of the house. The 
guesthouse section had open doors and no forced entry was made, I 
made contact with Banasiak, Date of Birth 04-07-1953, Fl DL 
B522-420-53-127-0, and informed him of the search warrant for the 
premises. The members of the Police Department entered the residence 
and announced we had a search warrant. A safety search was done and 
members exited the home. I read the search warrant to Banasiak as Mgr 
Parkinson videotaped the search warrant execution. Several interior 
decorators were located on the property. I spoke with Mark Zeff, of 
515 W 20th Street in New York. Mr. Zeff stated he is the designer for 
Mr. Epstein's homes. He advised he was contacted in March of 2005 to 
do a complete overhaul on the house. He advised he was on the phone 
with Mr. Epstein when officers announced the search warrant. Mr. 
Epstein was then made aware of the search warrant. Mr. Zeff advised, 
his contact with Epstein is strictly business and he has never 
witnessed Epstein with any girls except for his assistants, Sara or 


Nada. 


I then interviewed Daniel Estes, of 315 East 14th Street in New York. 
Mr. Estes stated he has worked for Zeff for seven years. He advised 
he personally worked on the New York and Palm Beach home for Mr. 
Epstein. He has previously met with Sara and Adrianna, Epstein's 
assistants in New York and in Florida. Estes stated they travel with 


Epstein everywhere he goes. 


I interviewed Zara Bailey of 35 Riverside Jersey City, New Jersey. 
Bailey stated she just arrived from Scotland and has worked with Zeff 
for only one month. She stated she has never met Epstein and has not 
seen him. The interview was then concluded. 


I then spoke with Douglas Schoettle of 243 Riverside Dr in New York 
City. Schoettle stated he has been Epstein's Architect for seven 
years. He further stated he deals with Epstein's assistants and 
speaks with Epstein on the phone. Schoettle stated he mainly speaks 
with Sara Kellen, Epstein s main assistant, who travels with Epstein. 
Schoettle stated he only has contact with Epstein when his services 


are needed. 


At approximately 10:30 am, I was informed that the videotaping was 
concluded. I entered the residence and located two covert (hidden) 
cameras. The first camera was a covert wall clock in the garage area. 
I traced the wire behind the clock and removed the RCA wire and 
unplugged the camera. The other covert camera was located within a 
desk clock beside Epstein's desk. I traced the wire behind the clock 
and unplugged the RCA wire. I could not locate another camera. I 
then began with the search of the residence for the specified 


evidence. 


My search consisted of the second floor. Det. Krauel and I began in 
the master bedroom area where several items were located. They were

closet, which was consistent with what the witnesses said. The 
massage table was also located within the master bedroom. Video tapes 
were located beside the television, which were also collected. An 
itemized list of the property and locations was prepared on the 
property receipts. At approximately 2:55 pm, the house was secured; 
the exit of the residence was videotaped. Upon our exit of the 
property, I encountered Atty. Guy Fronstein who advised he was 
representing Mr. Epstein. He provided a business card and provided 
his assistance with the investigation. 


Due to Hurricane Wilma, which struck South Florida causing massive 
power outages, the courthouse was closed due to the lack of power. I 
was previously told that the Chief Judge had extended the Fidgne 
deadlines due to the hurricane and the Courthouse being closed. on 
October 27, and 28, 2005 the courthouse was closed and I could not 
file the search warrant and inventory at the clerk's office. On 
October 31, 2005, I responded to the courthouse and filed the 
paperwork along with an order to seal, signed by Judge Johnson, to 
deny any release of any paperwork on this case.

On 102005 at approx 0930hrs I assisted with the execution of a 
search warrant at 358 El Brillo Ave, Palm Beach. 


Initially I was assigned to enter the residence and conduct a 
sweep of the premises for safety purposes. I then accompanied CSEU 
tech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once 
this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house 
with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant. 


We began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a 
Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage. 
Nothing of evidentiary value was located. 


We then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east 
side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets. 
Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained. 


A small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath 
area I located a phone message book with recent messages. This item 
was seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not 
used as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items 
to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items. 


We then searched a bath area and closet at the base of the main 
stairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were 
located as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were 
later seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in 


the bathroom. 


We then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the 
residence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis 
shaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis 
and vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were 
seized as evidence. 


We then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner 
of the property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as 
evidence. 


I was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was 
Douglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the 
beginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant 
service and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search 
was completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation 
with him regarding the reason for our presence. 


Regarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place 
and then collected by CSEU personnel. 


This concludes my involvement in this case.

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted 
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed 
by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media 
related material from the residence. 


Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as 
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the 
left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware Sitting on floor 
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or 
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with 
the power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the 
CPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor, 
printer, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I 
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware 
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk. 
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search 
and no external camera was located within this room. 


The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel 
LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative 
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. [It 
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the 
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same 
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices, 
i.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is 
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media 
was found. 


After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned 
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis 


via a property receipt. 


I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden 
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a 
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and 
printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed 
from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk 
area revealed no signs of any media devices. 


Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana 
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of 
the pool. In the South Fast corner of the room, I observed an office 
type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor, 
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the 
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A 
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.

Det. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the 
South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was 
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the 
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered 
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The 
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL 
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active 
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power 
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the 
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU, 
marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the 
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt. 
I also located several media related items within Room B, which were 
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence 


Custodians. 


I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a 
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer 
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on. 
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software, 
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active 
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed 
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other 
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was 
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic 
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related 
items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and 
turned over the Evidence Custodians. 


This concluded my participation in the search of the residence.

On December 20, 2005, I contacted ASA Daliah Weiss in an attempt to 
subpoena the Epstein former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. Rodriguez, 
who resides in Miami, had eluded the process servers previously and 
was not served the investigative subpoena. A telephone message was 
left as she is not available during the week of 12/19/2005. I made 
contact with State Attorney Inv Theresa Wyatt and requested the same 


via telephone message. 


I then researched the victim's @gj@cellular telephone subpoena data 
which had been received from a previous subpoena request. I analyzed 
the records which depict several calls from Haley Robson. The 
telephone calls start on February 6, 2005 at 12:49 pm.; the same day 
which the victim and the victim's father stated the incident occurred 
at Epstein s house. The first incoming call was from Robson's 
residence at 561 333-0180. The second incoming call from Robson's

cellular phone 561-308-0282 occurred at 1:02 pm. The call durations 
were one minute or less. The time frame was within thirteen minutes 
apart. It should be noted that Robson s residence was in close 
proximity to the victim's, The next call occurred at 5:50 pm when the 
victim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after 
the above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson. 
Further analysis showed no telephone calls to either Robson's cellular 
telephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6, 


2005. 


Additionally, I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from 
305-710-5165. The subscriber information confirmed that the number is 
registered to Paul A Lavery from Hialeah, Florida. The address was 
crossed referenced to the Office of Kiraly and Riley Private 
Investigators. I researched the web page www.rileykiraly.com which 
also showed various cases in which they assisted. I also located 
another web site under www.coralspringssparklandrotary.org in which 
Mr. Riley attended a Miami Rotary meeting and confirmed Atty. Roy 
Black is among his clientele. 


The telephone calls revealed Lavery had telephone contact with 

and Qe GMM either just after I attempted to 
interview them, or just prior. A background was conducted on Lavery 
which revealed he holds a current Private Investigator License. A 
criminal arrest record revealed he had been previously arrested for 
possession of cocaine and solicitation of prostitution. 


I also researched the girls using www.myspace.com. This web site is a 
new social networking service that allows members to create unique 
personal profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and 
new friends. The site allows one to establish your own myspace.com

Det. Caristo and I then located Qj @Q@Mp at her residence located

about Jeffrey Epstein. She advised she is so in love with Jeff 
Epstein and would do anything for him. She further explained that she 
would not speak with us about him either negative or positive. She 
asked us to leave her property. I informed her that although she did 
not wish to speak with us, I had sufficient information at this point 
in the investigation to know she was at Epstein's house and provided 
girls to Epstein to work. I also explained that prior to our arrival 
at her residence I had telephone contact with her father,

station. 









While at the police station, I left another telephone message for 
parents. I began an analysis of Sarah Kellen's Cellular 
telephone. The telephone number 917-855-3363 is assigned to Sarah 
Kellen and the financially responsible party is Jeffrey Epstein of 457 
Madison Ave. in New York City, New York. The time frame which was 
subpoenaed was September 2005, through October 2005. There were 
eighty seven pages of calls made either to the cell phone or from the 
cell phone. The local (561) numbers were analyzed. A spread sheet 
was prepared and placed into the attachment file of who was called. 


The unknown numbers were researched using FoneFinder.com and subpoenas 
were requested to determine subscriber information. This was done to 
identify additional victims or witnesses. The analysis revealed that 
Kellen had called the victim/witnesses frequently when Epstein was in 
the Town of Palm Beach to "work." This confirms what the girls 
interviewed had previously stated. Kellen would notify them when 
Epstein was in town and their willingness to "work." The CD was placed 


into evidence.

Mr. GUE oxpressed his interest in the resolution in this matter

On January 4, 2005, I acquired the subpoenas from the State Attorney's 
Office for Cingular Wireless, Metro PCS, Verizon, Bell South 
Telecommunications and Sprint for the unknown telephone numbers from 
Sarah Kellen's cellular telephone. The subpoenas were sent to the 
respective telephone carriers for subscriber information. 


I received a telephone call from State Attorney's Office, who informed 
me that the former houseman for Jeffrey Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez, 
was present at the State Attorney's Office for an interview. 

Rodriguez was issued an investigative subpoena for an interview on the 
on-goings at Epstein's house during his employ. I responded to the 
State Attorney's Office and encountered Mr. Rodriguez waiting in the

During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed 
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by 
associates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004 
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included 
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr. 
Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had 
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a 
message to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary 
"Leslie" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal 
assistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez 
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in 


residence. 


I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in 
Palm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked 
specifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he 
would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the 
morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. 
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them 
comfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them. 


Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them 
entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. 
They would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein. They 
would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if 
any of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask 
their ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate 
like his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they 
would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time. Rodriguez 
stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be 


masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered 
a dozen roses {Ci <., one of the girls 
that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high 
school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the 
massages, He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and 
would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. 
He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put 
them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood 
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed. 


Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a 
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive 
her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl 
always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself 
as a "human ATM machine" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a 
minimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl 
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or 
was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl 
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify 
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to

purchase several gifts and provide them as tips to the girls. I asked 
what kind of gifts. Rodriguez stated he purchased IPODS, jewelry, 
anything the girls would want. 


Rodriguez stated the amount of girls that came to the house was 
approximately fifteen. Each of the girls knew each other and all 
seemed to know at (___---ii , who Mr. Epstein was. 
When asked to identify these girls, Rodriguez stated he could not at 
the moment but knew he wrote their names down on a journal he kept 
during his employ with Mr. Epstein. He kept a journal in the event he 
needed to explain either to Mr. Epstein or his assistants what was 
done at the house or who visited the house as he stated he was 
in-charge of Mr. Epstein's personal security while in Palm Beach. I 
informed him I would need to view this journal to which he stated he 
would research the book and contact me to provide the book. The 
interview was concluded and left the area. I returned back to the 
police station where the micro cassette was placed into evidence. At 
approximately 7:20 pm, I was notified Rodriguez located the journal

to the case. During a sworn taped statement, Sjoberg stated she met 
Epstein three years ago when Ghaline Maxwell approached her while she

three years old when she met Epstein, anything that happened was 
between two consenting adults. I explained to her that she was not in 
any trouble however as part of this investigation, I needed to ask 
certain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein 
would ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her to 
rub his nipples as he masturbated himself. Sjoberg stated she felt 
"grossed" about the behavior but as she was getting paid, she just 
continued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the 
massages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize the 
vibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages. 
Sjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he 
maintained himself covered under the towel he would be wearing. When 
Epstein would masturbate he would be covered. 


I asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from 
Epstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised 
Epstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College. 
She received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke down. 


Additionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also 
recommended her to another client who resides at Breakers Row in Palm 
Beach. The client she was referred to was "Glenn" unknown last name, 
and his wife, who she provided a massages to. The statement was 
concluded and placed into evidence upon our return to the Palm Beach

Venero stated she knows Epstein and has been employed by him for 
approximately three years. Epstein has paid Venero to perform Swedish 
Massages (Deep Tissue) on him and other guests. Venero explained that 
approximately three year ago she met Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey 
Epstein through a mutual friend. Epstein and Maxwell were looking for 
a massage therapist. Venero stated since that time, she is notified 
when Epstein is coming to Palm Beach. Venero stated she comes to his 
house and provides the massage or massages. Venero explained she has 
also massaged his guests and assistants. Venero continued that she is 
paid $100.00 and hour for the massage. 


I asked Venero if anything occurred during the massage that would have 
made her feel uncomfortable. enero stated she only provided massages 
and that was it. She never was approached for anything else. I asked 
if Epstein ever asked her to rub his chest she stated she would not 
rub his chest as that is not part of her massage. Venero explained 
that she was not Epstein's type. The girls she would see at Epstein's 
house were very thin, beautiful and without tattoos. Venero explained 
She has several tattoos that are visible. Maxwell and Epstein have 
commented negatively about her tattoos previously when she has 


provided massages.

Venero stated she only provided massages for Epstein and his 

associates and nothing happened during those massages. Venero stated 
as she does Swedish style massages, the patient is usually sore after 
the massages. I thanked her for her assistance and the interview was 


concluded at this time. 


I received a facsimile from T-Mobile Cellular service on telephone 
number 561-317-5844, which is assigned to David Rodgers, pilot for Mr. 
Epstein, who resides in Lake Worth. Rodgers’ telephone number was 
dialed on several occasions by Sarah Kellen. A background on Rodgers

On Friday, February 3, 2006, I had made arrangements to meet with 
Joanna Harrison at the Palm Beach Police Station. At approximately 
1:00pm, Harrison and her friend, Victoria Bean arrived at the police 
station. During an interview with Harrison, she stated she met 
Epstein when she turned eighteen years old and was brought to 
Epstein's house to provide a massage. She advised this occurred on 
May of 2005. She advised Haley Robson had informed her if she wanted 
to provide a massage for $200.00. Harrison agreed and was brought to 
Epstein's house to provide a massage. Harrison stated she had been to 
the house on many occasions during the massage sessions. Harrison 
also stated she would remove her clothing to provide the massage on 
Epstein. Harrison advised Epstein would pay her $300.00 to rub his 
back, legs and chest. During the massages, Epstein would masturbate 
himself as she rubbed his chest. I asked her if Epstein ever touched 
her breasts during the massages. Harrison replied. "Yes." I asked her 
if Epstein ever touched or massaged her vagina. Harrison stated he 
had on several occasions. I asked her if he ever penetrated her with 
either his penis or any other objects. Harrison stated that during a 
massage he inserted his fingers in her vagina as she massaged him. 
She stated this occurred one time only. Harrison stated the massage 
would be over when Epstein would climax onto a towel. I asked 
Harrison if she had any formal massage training to which she replied 
that she did not. Harrison was then asked if she ever brought anyone 
to the house to "work." Harrison stated she brought two people to the 
house. She advised she received money for bringing people to the 
house to "work." Harrison stated she brought a girl named and 
her friend Tory Bean. Bean was still waiting for Harrison in the 
lobby of the police station. I thanked Harrison for her time and her 
cooperation and escorted her to the lobby.

conducting an investigation on Jeffrey Epstein and felt she may have 
information pertaining to the investigation. Ms Bean identified 
herself as Victoria Bean and resides in Wellington, Florida. She 
advised approximately a year ago she was brought to Epstein's house to 
provide a massage for money. Bean stated she needed to make money and 
felt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was 

to the house by Harrison and was introduced to Epstein and his 


brought 
assistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a 
massage. I asked her if she provided the massage naked. Bean stated 


she did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if 
Epstein touched her during the massage. She advised he did not, 
however he did masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. Once he 
climaxed the massage was over. She was paid her money and left the 
area. Bean advised it occurred one time and she never returned to 
Epstein's house. The interview was concluded and Bean was escorted to

attempted to meet with her and make telephone contact with negative 


results. 


On February 13, 2006, I met with David Rodgers at 7318 Heathley Drive 
in Lake Worth. Rodgers was identified as Epstein's pilot. I spoke 
with Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since 1991. 
He flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to. 
Rodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers 
stated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would 
be no way of knowing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent 
flight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up iii Gita, 
Rodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did 
remember @@Mi—i™ Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not 
know who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger 
manifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knows by name, Sarah 
and Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male 
passengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers. 
Mrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her 
husband consult with an attorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak 
with the family attorney to inform him of this questioning. TI 
explained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this 
investigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers 
could not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the

A Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006, 
in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been 
called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against 
Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's 
Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was 
postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of 
material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on 
myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The 
State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material. 


I requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in

The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented 
vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one 
of the victims. The other subpoena requested was for Jet Aviation for 
dates and times when Epstein's planes were in Palm Beach County.

Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's 
Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the 
subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling 
for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I 
spoke with ASA Weiss and informed her of the possible intimidation by 


the defense. 


On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several 
occasions with ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic to ascertain when the 
victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left 
on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am

would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief

On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate, 
Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm 
Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration, 
was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently 
acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's 
house is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may 
be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence, 
358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting 
remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed 
driving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida 
registration of F3000F. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north 
on County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr. 
Norr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain 
jobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I 
traveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue 
stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was 
visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane. 

We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a 
caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed 
several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of

Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 7/12/06 


On June 29, 2006, I had spoken to ASA Lana Belohlavic who informed me 
that the case would be sent to the Grand Jury for charges. She 
informed me that the grand jury would convene on July 19, 2006 to hear 
the Epstein case. Belohlavic stated State Attorney Barry Krisher made 
the determination to go the Grand Jury to hear the case. 


On July 12, 2006, I spoke with Mrs MM mother of the victim, @m who 
inquired about the status of the case. I explained to her that I was 
told we would be going to the Grand Jury during the week of July 19, 
2006. She stated she had not been contacted as of yet by the State 
Attorney's Office for any information. I provided her with the 
telephone numbers to the State Attorney's Office. 


Investigation continues. .

Maxwell, now 50, atlendec the weeding in Rhinebeck. NY. on July 34, 2010, with the cream af 
Washington OC. 

Described as feeling like a ‘family wedding’, guests included farmer Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright. Terry McAuiiffe, Governor of Virginia. and leading figure in the civil ights movement 
Vernon Jordan. 

For Maxwell to remain a Clinton chum is an interesting lurn of events. 

Just two years earlier, her former lover and friend Jeffrey Epstein was sentenced to 18 months 
behing bars after pleading to a single slate charge of scliciting prostitution. He served 13 months in 
prison, 

President Clinton had been so close to both to Epstesn he had joined him an his private jet and 
stayed on his private Caribbean isiand. 

Speaking to the Mail On Sunday in 2011, Virginia Roberts - who claims in court papers she was 
kept as Epstein’s ‘sex siave' and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times - said she met 
President Clinton twice, but was never ‘tent aut’.

Q. Are you -- how would you describe a 14 year 
old, a woman or a girl? 

A. A girl, of course. 

Q. How would you describe a 16 year old, a woma 
ora girl? 

A. Again, I don't know. Iam not -- I don't 
think I can tell you exactly she is 14 or 16. 

Q. But if you knew -- 

A. Sixteen, I would think is a girl, of course. 

Q. Were there ever any visitors to the Epstein 
house that you considered to be girls, as opposed to 
women? 

A. Yes. Yes. I think I would says, I never 
check her i.d. 

Q. Right. 

A. Or Iwas not told to check i.d.s. -- 

Q. Of course. 

A. -- on these girls. But one, I would says, 


Page 22 


N.B. was very young because she was in high school. And 
sometimes either I pick her mother and herself from her 
house or I pick her from The School of the Arts or the 
ballet place, ballet in West Palm Beach. I can't 
remember exactly what that place is, the name of the 
place. 

Q. Did you give -- provide transportation for any 
other females while you worked for Mr. Epstein? 

A. Occasionally, yes, I did. 

Q. Do you happen to remember the names of any of 
those females? 

A. Iremember one, specifically one. It was V. 
Her name was V. I can't remember her last name, but I 
think it was P. I'm not sure. I can be wrong on that. 

Q. And how many times did you provide 
transportation services for this female? 

A. Whenever I had -- I been told. Whenever I was 
told to go get them or bring them back to their house. 

Q. Did you consider V. to be a girl or a woman? 

A. Again, I think it was a woman, from myself, 
her dressing and her -- I think it was -- again, I don't 
know if she was 16, 17 or 18 or 19, could have been. 
But she was not -- I never pick her up from a school or 
anything like that. The only girl that I picked up from 
the school was N.

Q. Okay. Do you remember any other females being 
present at the house, other than the females that you've 
mentioned, which were N., her mother, Sarah Kellen, V. 

Were there any others that you -- 

A. Many, many, many, many, many. 

Q. When did you first -- 

MR. CRITTON: Can I just have the last 
question read back? 

MR. WILLITS: Of course you can. 

MR. CRITTON: Please. 

MR. WILLITS: But only once. 

MR. CRITTON: That's all I need. 

MR. WILLITS: You sure. 

Go ahead. 

(Previous question was read.) 

MR. CRITTON: And can I just ask for a 
clarification from you? Are you going to use -- if 
you use the word woman, are you -- 

MR. WILLITS: I said, females. 

MR. CRITTON: No, no, I understand. But in 
the future if you use woman, does that mean, at 
least to Mr. Alessi, that that's married, and if 

it's a girl she has to be 14 or 16? Because that's 
how you asked the question. 

MR. WILLITS: All I'm going to talk about is 





females. 

MR. CRITTON: Okay. 

MR. WILLITS: And ask -- 

MR. CRITTON: I'll be alert to the questions 
then. 

MR. WILLITS: All right. So you don't need to 
sleep through the next few questions. 

MR. CRITTON: I don't sleep at all. 

MR. WILLITS: All right. Now I'm totally 
confused. 

BY MR. WILLITS: 

Q. When did you first become aware of females 

visiting the Epstein house? 

Since I know him. 

During the renovations? 

Yeah.

milepost.

A. Before it was Ms. Maxwell, it was only one 
woman that it was Mr. Epstein's girlfriend. And her 
name was Dr. -- she was a doctor of medicine -- Eva 
Anderson. And I really liked this girl. She was very

visitors came from? 

A. They were mostly European girls. 

Q. And when you say, "girls," do you mean 14 to 
16, -- 

A. No. 

Q. -- or do you mean females? 

A. They all were, I would says, under -- over 20 
years old. 

Q. Okay. And it has been explained to us in 
another deposition that sometimes females travelled wit 
Mr. Epstein. 

A. Yes, they did.

And some just names that I cannot -- I cannot go on. 

Q. Sure. How did you know that D. or J. were 
there for purposes of a massage? 

A. Because I was told to either Ms. Maxwell will 
call, I will call or Mr. Epstein will told me, call this 
girl at that time. Sometimes it was 1:00 in the 
morning. Sometimes it was within the afternoon. 
Sometimes it was after the movies. They usually go intc

girls that come at 10:00, 10:30.

I'd put her as a regular massage therapist. 

Q. Do you know how these females would be

how -- 

A. Some, they were transported by the boyfriends 
or the husbands and they wait outside. 

Q. How about, are you aware of any of the females

Q. And how did you know they were actually 
providing massages? 

A. Most of them, they had business card and they 
left me business cards. And some of them asked me to 
call them to provide them work. 

And I says that was not my job. My job was to 
call whoever they wanted. Either when she -- 

Ms. Maxwell want a massage, she will told me, I want a 
massage at this time with this person.

these females?

tab of the hours and I will pay amount at the end of the 
week,

Q. Where would the cash or checks come from to 
make deposits?

check. Were there occasions when the females would 
be -- 

A. 

Q. 

A. 
John? 


orvAa oF WN FEF 


There were occasions -- 
-- paid by cash? 
-- where the girls says, do you have any cash, 
They were asking for cash. 
I says, let me take a look. So I check my 
petty cash box that we have for the house for the 


Page 34 


expenses. And if I have it, I pay it. If not, 
Mr. Epstein will pay. 

Q. Did you ever have any concerns that any of the 
females coming to the Epstein house for the purposes of 
massage might be under the age of 18? 

A. No, because I never saw younger, young, young 
girls. And mostly that I was told they were massage 
therapists. 

Q. Told by who? 

A. By Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein. 

Q. Did you ever have any dealings with Sarah 
Kellen about the females who came to provide massage 
services? 

A. No. Sarah Kellen came about, I would says,

fellow employees about the females who were coming to

Q. The latter? 

A. The latter. 

Q. What, if anything, can you remember or tell us 
about your separation agreement? 

A. It was basically an agreement between him and 
myself that we will leave after all those years of 
service. 

And I regret to agree with the amount, but it 
was $30,000 for me and $20,000 for my wife. 

And it was -- he give my wife the car that she 
usually drive. It was a minivan, Chrysler minivan, as 
part of the -- as part of the separation. She loved 
that car and she did all the shopping, it was done in 
that car. 

So Mr. Epstein was kind enough to give her the 
car. 

The rest of the stuff is, was mainly lawyer 
stuff that you can't understand. But basically that was 
it. And that it was a part that I think I can -- I 
would says, it was more or less that I will not sue him 
later or he cannot sue me for any reasons or -- and it 
was like a confidentiality issue in that separation 
agreement. 

Q. And do you understand that in this instance 
you are subpoenaed under the power of the Court? 


Page 40 


A. Absolutely. 

Q. And that would include matters that would 
otherwise be confidential? 

A. Can you repeat that again? 

Q. Yeah. Do you understand that because you're 
under subpoena by the Court to give your testimony, -- 

A. Today. 

Q. -- truthfully -- yes. 

A. Uh-huh. 

Q. That the confidentiality agreement would not 
control; the Court's subpoena -- 

A. Oh, yeah. 

Q. -- controls? 

A. Tunderstand that. 

Q. You mentioned Ghislaine Maxwell did photo 
shoots and kept an album? 

A. Yes. She was fanatic about photographs -- 
camera. She had a whole bunch of different cameras and 
she took all the pictures all over. 

Q. Did you ever observe her doing a photo shoot 
of V.?

Q. Yes. 

A. No, Ican't remember. I know that she went 
out and took pictures in the pool because later on I 
would see them at the desk or at the house. 

And nude -- 99.9 percent of the time they were 

topless. They were European girls. They were -- 

Q. You stated that you believe V.'s name was P., 
but you weren't sure?

Q. Could it have been R.? 

A. R., yeah. Yeah. Could have been. 

Q. I want to show you a picture and have it 
marked as an Exhibit to this deposition. 

MS. EZELL: And did we have the agreement 
beforehand that we've been having all along that 
we're just using initials and not names? 

MR. WILLITS: My client has waived the 
confidentiality as to herself. But I certainly 
agree as to everybody else. 

MR. LANGINO: As do I. 

MS. EZELL: Is that okay? 

MR. CRITTON: That's what we agreed to on the 
last. 

MS. EZELL: Right. 


Page 42 


MR. CRITTON: For the court reporter, at 
least, in terms of the -- I guess in terms of the 
transcript she gives to us, if you would just use a 
first initial and a last initial. 

MR. WILLITS: So when you ask about V., it 
would be V.R. is what the court reporter would 
write down? 

MS. EZELL: Right. 

MR. CRITTON: But make sure everybody uses the 
full name, because that way we'll have two 
initials. 

MR. WILLITS: When they speak, but she's going 
to write it down as initials. Is that what you're 
saying? I'm confused about everything. 

MR. CRITTON: The reason is, is there may be 
25, you know, there may be three V.s. So if you 
just mention V. and it just shows up as a V., it 
won't make sense. So ergo you need to do that. 
But Carolyn Andriano, his client, she gets the 
whole megillah. 

MR. WILLITS: Right. 

MR. BERGER: How is it preserved that we're 
talking about your client? You gave her full name 
a minute ago. How is it preserved if she's -- the 
court reporter is going to change the full name to

V.R.? Obviously the tape preserves it. We're not

full name, but would just have the initials. 

MR. BERGER: I'm not so sure that constitutes 
an identification by Mr. Alessi that's going to be 
clear. But this is the first deposition I've 
attended, so I'm not sure if I'm -- if what I'm 
saying has been dealt with or not. 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: I think we're working on 
good faith. Mr. Critton is agreeing that the 
name -- and I don't think anyone's going to come 
back later and say, oh, you meant Vince Robinson o 
anything like that, so... 

MR. BERGER: Well, I'm not -- I'm not talking 
about Mr. Critton. Bob Critton I have the full 
trust in. I'm just talking about a jury watching 
this or reading this transcript believing that 
Mr. Alessi has accurately identified one of these 
victims. That's all. I don't know if you've all 


Page 44 


thought about that. 

MS. EZELL: Well, for one thing, the jury 
might, if they're -- if they're hearing or reading 
his testimony, they most likely would be seeing the 
video, which would have the full name. Unless the 
Judge allows us to block out names and we haven't 
come to that point. 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: I think the idea at trial, 
V.R., if it's read to the jury would become then 
V.R. It would be read as V.R. But if it's filed 
with the Court, this transcript, it will be V.R., 
and that way it doesn't have to be redacted. 

MR. WILLITS: As I also understood it, if 
there would be any question at all, we could simply 
ask the court reporter and she would say, according 
to my notes, V.R. is Virgil Robinson and not -- or 
whatever her notes show. Wouldn't she be the fina 
authority? 

MS. EZELL: Well, she would certainly have 
that record. 

MR. CRITTON: You could listen to the tape. 
It would be pretty easy. I think we're making it a 
lot more complicated than it need be. 

MR. WILLITS: For once, I agree. 

MR. CRITTON: I think it will be all right.

MS. EZELL: I'm going to ask -- I don't know 
whether you've still been serially designating 
Exhibits or whether we're doing them separately for 
deposition. 

MR. CRITTON: I think we cannot trust that 
people will do them serially. I'd do them with 
each one. 

MS. EZELL: Then would you mark this, please, 
as Exhibit | to this deposition. 

And I'm just going to state on the record that 
I will keep that original. We will not attach it 
to the deposition. 

(Exhibit number | was marked for 


orAa oF WN FPF 


identification purposes and retained by Counsel for the 
Plaintiffs.) 


THE WITNESS: Yes, that's -- 


BY MS. EZELL: 


Q. Can you identify that -- the young woman in 


those pictures? 


A. Yes. 
Q. Who is it? 
A. That's V. -- V. Now that you says R., that 


is V.R. definite, a hundred percent. 


MR. CRITTON: Let me just note my objection, 
as I did in A. Rod's deposition or Mr. Rodriguez's 


Page 46 


deposition, that I know you're going to confiscate 
Exhibit number 1. I think it's inappropriate. I 
think I should be allowed to have a copy of 
Exhibits that are being used in deposition. But 
I'll file a motion with the Court so we don't get 
into a pulling match over your Exhibits. 

MR. BERGER: I would ask that the court 
reporter initial that. 

MS. EZELL: Sure. 

Oh, you did? 

MR. WILLITS: She marked it. 

MR. BERGER: Did she put her initials or did 
she just put a number or a letter? 

MR. CRITTON: She's nodding that she did 
everything that she usually does, which means, 
initials, date and number. 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: You can talk. 

MR. WILLITS: But when you talk, use your 
initials. 


BY MS. EZELL: 


Q. How old did you think V.R. was at the time she 


began coming to Mr. Epstein's home?

THE WITNESS: Could have been. But, you know. 
I am not -- I don't think I am a very good judge of 
ages. If you ask me how old you are, I really 
couldn't tell you. 

MR. CRITTON: Kathy thinks she's 25. 

MS. EZELL: In my dreams. 

THE WITNESS: Now, again, I must tell you, I 
was never told to check any i.d.s on any of the 
people who work at the house. 

BY MS. EZELL: 

Q. I understand that. And, so, I think I'm just 
trying to establish that you didn't consider it part of 
your job description to worry about or consider the 
ages -- 

A. No. 

Q. -- of the young women that came there? 

A. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. 

Q. And, so, you never really focused on that or 
particularly thought about it if they seemed young? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: I don't -- I didn't see that 
many young girls, you know, young, underage girls 
at the house. I never saw except the two girls 
that I mentioned that I think it was underage was 
N. for sure because she was still in high school. 


Page 48 


And she -- she had dinner with her mother, a couple 
times with her mother. And she become an actress. 
She's an actress and she has done movies. And he 
help her in her career. 

That's the only girl that I knew she was young 
because she was going to high school and I pick her 
up from high school sometimes. But she was not a 
massage therapist. She will go for dinner. And 
they will go for the movies and she sang sometimes 
because she was a singer. So she sung at the 
house. Beautiful girl. Very talented. 

That's the only girl that I know that it 
was -- I would says, underage. 

BY MS. EZELL: 

Q. Okay. Did -- who told you that V.R. was a 
massage therapist? 

A. Nobody. 

Q. Did you assume that she was a massage 
therapist because you were told she was coming to give 4 
massage? 

A. No. I assumed she was a massage therapy 
because I was -- I drove Ms. Maxwell to Mar-a-lago, 
Donald Trump's residence. And I wait in the car while 
Ms. Maxwell got a -- I think it was a facial or massage. 
I don't know. But that day I remember this girl, V.,

walking down from the main lobby towards the spa of 
Mar-a-lago. And I was driving Ms. Maxwell up, up the 
ramp. It's a little ramp there. 

And Ms. Maxwell says, stop. And she went and 
talked to -- she went inside. 

And that afternoon around 5:00 I saw V. came. 
She came to the house already, so she was there already. 
That was the first day I knew. And then she would come 
regularly. 

Q. Did you ever meet any of V.'s family? 

A. No. I think she was -- one time I think her 
father drove her there. And I met -- I don't know if it 
was the boyfriend or husband or -- but he had to wait, 
make him wait outside while she was at the house.

Q. Do you know the name or recognize the name 
Tony Santiago? 
A. I think it was him. 


Q. That was her -- 
A. I know he had an old beat-up car, Camaro or 
Mustang. I know it was very old car that I make him 


wait on the street one time. I make him come out of the 
driveway because we have to move some cars around. 
Q. Did there ever come a time when Tony Santiago 
was welcome in the kitchen? 
A. I think he came once in the kitchen, but 


Ms. Maxwell told me to get him out. 

Q. Did she tell you why? 

A. No. She didn't -- I guess she didn't want to 
become, you know, everybody -- because some of these 
people came with their husbands and they wait outside. 
And I guess she didn't want this to become a norm for 
everybody to bring their companions while they have -- 
they will do a massage for her. 

Q. During the time you were there, did you ever 
know of Tony Santiago bringing any other girls to 
Mr. Epstein? 

A. No. I knew that sometimes I saw V. bring 
other girls with her, not Tony Santiago. 

Q. Do you remember the names of any of those 
girls -- 

A. No, I don't. 

Q. -- that V. brought? 

A. That was at the end of my stay there. No. 

That was a very -- at the very end of the last month of 
my stay. 

Q. Did you give -- I don't believe I asked you, 
but if I did, forgive me. Did you give us an 
approximate year in which you were taking Ms. Maxwell tc 
Mar-a-lago and saw V.R. for the first time? 

A. That was at the -- at the end of my stay

there. So I would says, between three months maybe 
before I left. And I think I left at the end of the 

year, so it could have been -- I remember it was a very 
hard day because I had to wait in the sun outside in a 
convertible and I was dying, waiting for an hour for 
Ms. Maxwell. I think it was in the summer of 2002. 

Q. And if I remember correctly, you left in 
November or December of 2002? 

A. Yes. 

Q. So that might have been perhaps July or August 
of 2002? 

A. Uh-huh. 

Q. And, so, as I understand it, you only saw V.R. 
come to that house during the last three months of your 
time at Mr. Epstein's? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Do you have any -- any sense or can you 
approximate how many times she came? 

A. I cannot give you a number, but I would says, 
two, three times a week. 

Q. You mentioned that sometimes you would have to 
call these massage therapists in the middle of the 
night. Did you ever have to call V. for Mr. Epstein in 
the middle of the night? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 


THE WITNESS: No. No.

Q. Did there come a time while you were there 
that V.R. stayed in the house? 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

Q. How many bedrooms were there upstairs? 

A. One, two, three -- one, two, three, four -- 
four -- so that would be five, five bedrooms. 

Q. Five. And, so, would one have been 
Mr. Epstein's bedroom? 

A. Yes. His quarters was big, huge quarters. 

Q. Sort of a suite? 

A. Yeah. And he has -- this is the room. His 
bathroom was here and her bathroom was here. The mai 
room was here. And we have -- it was two sets of doors 
before -- two sets of double doors before you can go 
into the suite. There was one on top of the stairway 
and one in the middle of the hallway. And then you walk 
into the -- into the suite. 

Q. Okay. And you -- you just put a red eight by

Q. And Ms. Maxwell? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And his bath was on one side and hers was on

A. Yes. Yes, ma'am. 

Q. So did she not have a separate bedroom? 

A. Ms. Maxwell? No. Sometimes she slept in a 
different bedroom. Don't ask me why. 

Q. Okay. But generally at that point in time she 
was still -- 

A. Yeah. 

Q. -- sleeping in, for most nights, the same 
bedroom -- 

A. Yeah. 

Q. -- as Mr. Epstein? 

A. Uh-huh. 

Q. And then there was the service quarters, the 
service department? 

A. The service quarters before we moved down to 
the other house, it was in one corner of the property in 
the second floor. 

Q. And what -- what other bedrooms were there?

. Inthe service quarters?

On the second floor.

Other than --

the pink room. We called the blue room. And the parro 
room. We call a parrot room because there was a crazy 
designer, all full of parrots. It look like you were in 
the jungle. But that was changed, so that became the 
blue room. 

So it was the blue room, the red room and the 
pink room. That was the main guest, for the main guest 
rooms. 

Then it was my room and we have like a little 
sitting area for ourselves, for myself. 

And upstairs there were one, two, three, four,

And did you say that N.B. did spend nights

A. No, not that I remember. 

Q. She never did? 

A. Not that I remember, no. Because she was not 
there until the whole length of time that I work for 
Mr. Epstein. She was there for maybe a year or two 
years. Then she moved to California. She was -- moved 
the whole family to Hollywood. 

And that's N.B.? 

N. 

You mentioned Dr. Eva Anderson?

the house? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Would she stay in the house when Ms. Maxwell 
was there as well? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And did she have sort of a regular room there? 
A. Let me repeat. Can you repeat that again, the 
questions before? Because I think I says, yes, when 
Eva -- when Maxwell was there, I not think -- I can't 
remember Eva being there. She was there for a little 
bit because they become friends after that and they have 
dinners and lunches and she would come, because Eva gof 
married and she had kids and -- and they were -- called 
Mr. Epstein, Uncle Jeffrey. 
So they become friends. And -- but I don't 
think she ever slept at the house again because she had 
her own house in Palm Beach. 
Q. When you first went there to work would she 
sometimes sleep at the house? Was that before she was 
married?

split up and she went her own way. 

Q. Did she marry a Glen Dubin (phonetics)? 

A. That's correct. And Mr. Dubin used to come to 
the house, too. 

Q. Do you know, was Sarah Kellen ever one of the 
massage therapists before she became an assistant? 


arAroajuw BF WN EF 


A. I don't know if she was a massage therapist. 

I don't remember setting up a massage table for her. I 
think she was an assistant. And she would call -- at 
the end of my stay, I was -- tried to pull aside from my 
obligations and Sarah was doing all the phone calls and 
all the arrangement and all the looking out for these 
girls for the -- for massage therapists. They were 
constantly. 

Q. When did that role get transferred from you to 
Ms. Maxwell, the role of looking after girls and calling 
the girls? 

A. I didn't look after -- out for girls. 

Ms. Maxwell was the one that recruit -- I remember one 
occasion or two occasions she would says to me, John, 
give me a list of all the spas in Palm Beach County. 
And I will drive her from one to the other one to PGA 
and Boca. And she will go in, drop credit cards -- not 
credit cards, but business cards, and she come out. Andi 


Page 58 


then we go to -- she will recruit the girls. Was 
never -- never done by me or Mr. Epstein or anybody 
else, that I know. 
I don't know about Sarah because Sarah was 
there at the last, last -- probably last weeks of my 
stay there. So I cannot say anything about Sarah. 
Q. Was there any point in time -- well, let me 
ask you this way: Did -- you said sometimes you would 
call the girls to come -- 
A. Uh-huh. 
Q. -- to give them massage. And sometimes 
Ms. Maxwell would? 
A. Yeah. 
Q. Did there come a time when she took that over 
entirely from you -- 
. No. 
-- or that continued -- 
. That's continued.

. Yeah. 
. Do you remember, is Jeffrey Epstein godfather 
to one of the Dubin children?

A. Regularly. 

But I was more involved with her mother. I 
took care of her mother, Mr. Epstein's mother. She was 
avery ill lady. I don't know if she's still alive or 
not, but I lost contact. 

Q. How often would she come to visit? 

A. She didn't come to visit too often. She had 
an accident, a very bad accident. She lost her trachea, 
so she had a -- how they call the -- the thing they put 
them in your neck to talk? 

Q. Sort of a voice box. I don't know the 
technical name. 

A. I don't know the technical name, -- 

Q. Right. 

A. -- but they open her throat and she had this 
thing to talk and she had to cover her throat to talk. 

And I was more involved with her than her own 
kids. I took her to Miami for the operation. I was 
there for the operation. And she -- we have a lot of 
fun with her. I mean, she -- she was a very good lady. 

Q. Now, other than Mark Epstein, were there any 
other brothers and sisters? 

A. No. He only has one brother that I know. 

Q. And where does he live? 

A. He lives in New York.

Would you describe for me what kinds of 
vibrators you found? 

A. I'm not familiar -- not too familiar with the

rubber things like that (indicating). And I used to go 
and put my gloves on and pick them up, put them in the 
sink, rinse it off and put it in Ms. Maxwell -- 

Ms. Maxwell had in her closet, she had, like, a laundry 
basket, one of those laundry basket that you put laundry 
in. She have full of those toys. And that was -- and 
that was me being professional, leaving the room ready 
for bed when he would come back to the room again.

find out what it's all about. Because it was an 
occasion with Mr. Epstein that we had a disagreement. 
We settled that. Everything was well and we went our 


friendly ways and never heard from him again. 





And I received this from the police department 





that we need to talk to you. And, so, I got scared.

house. I left my family. I end up with a woman that

talk to him and says, John, -- I went with some faxes

$50,000, plus the van. 

And he says, okay, John, wish you good luck.

was friendly. At the beginning of the -- my job was 
very friendly. Then he changed when Ms. Maxwell come 
in. I didn't like to work for her. She was a bitch.

QO. Correct? 
A. Yes. 
Os And subsequently there was an incident in 2003 


that you've described in some detail, based on the 


questions that have been asked, and you and Mr. Epstein 


reached an amicable agreement; you repaid him the monies 
that you had taken and you parted? 

A. Yes. 

QO. Is that a fair statement? 

A. And I will have to add something to that. 


When we talk at the luncheonette, we have coffee, he 





says, John, if you were not my best employee that 








have and that you would not take care of my mother, 
would have put you away. And that's the way he come out 
to me. 

And I says, I like you and let's -- just pay 


me back in one or two weeks, because I send the money 





back and it got lost. So he give me another -- not him, 


but his lawyer says, you got another month to pay. So 





between I got the money -- the money order was lost in 





the mail. So I send it back. I pay everything, $6,310. 


think it was 6310. And that was it.

over, she would be over there at Mr. Epstein's home with 
her mother; is that correct?

were there, I think you've described on page 9 of your

different massage therapists? 


A. It could be less. I don't think it's more 


than 200, but it could be less than 200, yes. It was -- 
it was 11 years or 12 years or 13 years of constant

~~ and problems with your marriage? 

Absolutely. 

What kind of psychological problems? 

I say, psychological problems. I says, 
marital problems. That would be a better answer it. 
Because the stressful was on me. Tf there was a dust, 
spot of dust, they never came to her. And she was able 


to ~~ she was over involved with the cleaning crew, but 





it was never from Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell yell, they 


will never go to Mari to ask, hey, Mari, why this 
doesn't look good.

a massage therapist because she went to high school

brought to the house by her mother. So I knew they 
had nothing to do with massages. They were friends 


and they were going to the movie with her, dinner 





with her. And she had -- I think she travelled 


with her, too. They travel.

talking about the massage therapists. And you said that

you liked the job and you liked Mr. Epstein, but you

or Can you tell me why, other than that she 





blamed you for everything? 

A. She came from a very wealthy family and she 
was -- just my opinion; I give my personal opinion -- 
that she was rotten spoiled and she tried to drive the 
house like a palace and not a home. 


I was -- I discussed it with her, many, many 





times we have discussions. And sometimes I even refuse 





to do her orders, knowing that I was going to be backed 


up by Mr. Epstein or do the right thing, my thinking of 


running the house should be. But we never had a good 





- relationship at all from the beginning, I don't think 


so. But I was -- have to be her driver and she will go 
and shop all over the malls and I will have to go behind 
her, pay for it and bring the bags to the car. 

Next day or the same day she will do shopping 


and buy and say, John, go to this store and get it. It 





was a lot of work. Tt was a lot that she created and

QO. And one of those things you also had to do 
with her was to take her to different spas? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And there she would recruit young women to 


come and do massages? 





A. Because she was English. And she didn't know 


the area too much as well as I knew. So she -- she 





says, John, make a list of all the massage -- the spas 


in the area from Jupiter to Boca Raton. And we went to 





all the main spas. And then we went to the schools for 





| massage therapists, and all the massage parlors, and 


massage, the small massage. 





So I make a list from the telephone book and 





| 
we would go from one to the another one. I would wait 
in the car and she goes in. 

And sometime she took a couple minutes and 
walk out with cards, business cards. And that -- she 
did the recruiting. 


| And from then, she pick up the girls and that 





was the end of it. I never did any recruiting and I 
never really saw him doing it.

By Emily Smith February 2, 2015 | 9:38pm 


Ghislaine Maxwell is quietly selling her New York townhouse on East 65th Street amid 
renewed gossip about her relationship with disgraced mogul Jeffrey Epstein. 


Maxwell’s been accused of acting as a “madam” and “procuring girls” for wealthy sex 
offender Epstein — claims that she strongly denies. 


Her home’s said to be nearly 7,000 square feet and was reportedly purchased in 2010 
by an attorney with long-standing links to Epstein.

Now, sources tell Page Six, “Ghislaine is putting the word out to her wealthy friends 
that she is ready to sell,” and wants more than $20 million. 





Ghislaine Maxwell on the Upper East Side Perhaps she hopes to put some distance between herself and Epstein, who owns a

Her rep didn’t comment.

Deposition taken before MICHELLE PAYNE, Court 
Reporter and Notary Public in and for the State of 
Florida at Large, in the above cause. 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: This is the case of 
Jane Doe No. 2, plaintiff, versus | effrey 
Epstein, defendant. Jane Doe No. 3, 
plaintiff, versus J effrey Epstein, 
defendant. Jane Doe No. 4, plaintiff, 
versus J effrey Epstein, defendant. And Jane 
Doe No. 5, plaintiff, versus J effrey 
Epstein, defendant. Jane Doe No. 6, 
plaintiff, versus J effrey Epstein, 
defendant. Jane Doe No. 7, plaintiff, 
versus | effrey Epstein, defendant. CMA, 
plaintiff, versus J effrey Epstein, 
defendant. And Jane Doe, plaintiff, versus 
Jeffrey Epstein, et al, defendant. And Jane 
Doe -- is there a shorter thing that we can 
do here? It's also missing this one right 
here. 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: Do we have a problem 
with saying J ane Doe 2 and the Epstein and 
related cases? 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: I'm missing this J ane 


WOMONA UBRWNFE 





Page 8 
Doe right here on the copy you gave me. I'm 
missing which J ane Doe this is. 

They're all different case numbers. Do 
you want me to go through each case number? 

MR. CRITTON: I'm going to note my 
objection. Obviously if this deposition 
gets played -- not obviously, I'm going to 
object to the litany of each one so | don't 
know how we can separate it out. Maybe if 
and when at the time of trial and depending 
on how the Court determines what comes in 
and what doesn't with regard to the 
consolidated aspects of this. | have no 
great idea other than just saying Jane Doe 
versus Epstein, et al, or something like 
that, or Jane Doe, et al. 

MS. EZELL: Couldn't we just say and 
those cases which have been consolidated 
with it for Discovery purposes? 

MR. EDWARDS: Although there is cases 
here that have cross noticed this from state 
court that haven't been consolidated so that 
may not work. You may have to read them 
all, if it works out your way that will just 
get edited out, at least he will have read 


Page 9 
that caption, every caption. Right? Is 
there a better suggestion? 

MR. CRITTON: No. There may be a better 
suggestion if he starts this is such and 
such day, it's the deposition of Mr. 

Rodriguez in the case such and such, and we 
can almost fill it in depending on which 

tape it goes, how it fills in, at least 

we'll have the context of the first and 
depending on whether the J udge reads it in 
from a consolidated or they all come 

related, | have no great idea. 

MR. EDWARDS: | was thinking if he read 
every one of them and it was the seventh in 
line then you just would edit it so you 
would only read that one. 

MR. CRITTON: I'm okay with that too. 

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: On page number three 
there is something missing on the top here. 

Do you want me to read each case number 
separately? 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: | don't think it's 
necessary. 

MR. EDWARDS: | don't think it's 
necessary either.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: So just go through 
just the names. 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: That's sufficient. And 
there is a cross notice for one of the state

notice? Off the record.

Q. So he had coffee at 6:30 a.m. Did he

A. Yes. 

Q. Continue. What did you do then? 





Page 20 

A. We have guests that particular day and 
arrange, coordinate with the chef if | have to go 
buy the groceries, gas the cars. That was a 
routine everyday. Relay instructions to the 
housekeepers and the gardeners and the pool 
people. Arrange meals. This was done by the chef 
but | was trying to be sure Mr. Epstein was fed at 
his lunch time. And then of course through the 
day he will give me instructions. 

Q. So he would give you instructions himself 
personally? 

A. Secretary. 

Q. Okay. Now, let's go through who the 
household staff was at the time that you started. 

Who would you say worked under your 
supervision as the household manager? 

A. It was a Filipino lady by the name of 
Louella. | don't recall her last name. 

Q. Louella Rabuyo? 

A. Yes, exactly, yes. 

Q. What did she do? 

A. She would be the housekeeper in charge of 
the laundry, cleaning the household, everything 
inside the house. 

Q. And who else? 


Page 21 

Jerome. Jerome Pierre was the gardener. 

And he was full-time? 

Full-time, yes. 

Who else? 

And then we have a young lady who used to 
take care of the pool but | don't recall her name 
right now. She used to come three times a week, 
sometimes four times. Most every day we used to 
have J ohn Cassidy air conditioner came to the 
house because it's hot and it's humid. What 
contractor that's almost on a daily basis there. 

Q. Because there was problems with the air 
conditioner? 

A. Well, the house is big, and all the house 
in Palm Beach need constant attention. 

Q. Okay. 

A. That's the full -- and the chef, David, | 
can't remember his last name. 

Was it Mullen? 

| don't recall, sir, right now.

David, yes. 

Was there a butler as well?

Page 22 

Q. Was there a Michael Liffman that was 
hired as a butler at some point? 

A. That was before me. 

Q. Okay. Who was the household manager 
before you? 

A. | understand there were several in one 
year. There was Mike Friedman, there is J] oe 
Alessi. There was a couple of Filipino girls -- 
no, they were from Bangladesh. | can't remember. 
| used to send his -- | used to forward his mail 
to Maryland but | can't recall right now, sir. 

Q. Okay. And at the time you took the job 
it was open, he didn't have anyone in that 
position. Is that correct? 

A. What | find is the staff from his house 
in Manhattan they gave me the briefing on what he 
likes and what he doesn't like. Belinda Retta 
from Mrs. Maxwell, they were due to give me an 
inside look because it was too much to learn in 
48 hours so they were there handling the house 
before me, so there were two couples. 

Q. Two couples. All right. Let's walk 
through that. So the first day you come to work 
you're basically you received some training? 

A. Exactly. 


Page 23 

Q. And tell us who provided that training? 

A. Joe-Joe is his nickname but he runs Mr. 
Epstein's estate in Manhattan as well as his wife. 
They were very nice people telling me because you 
have to understand, there is a lot of specifics, 
where to park the car, here and there, if the 
plane lands here you have to park the Mercedes, 
you know, very specific details, and he gave me an 
inside of all of that. 

Q. Okay. So you would pick up Mr. Epstein 
at the airport? 

Yes. 

And how long did this training last? 

Two or three days. 

Okay. And it was J 0e-] oe and his wife? 

Joe-] oe, yes. 

You don't remember the last name or full 
names? 

A. No, sir. 

Q. Anything else you can remember that you 
were told specifically regarding his preferences? 

A. He likes Columbian coffee, that's the 
only type of coffee he drinks, and it was shipped 
from New York from Balducci's, stuff like that. 
Where to buy the groceries. And he's allergic to 





Page 24 
garlic, maybe something like that, you know, 
personal things. 

You mentioned Ms. Maxwell? 

Yes, 

Who is she? 

She was her companion. 

Whose companion? 

Mr. Epstein. 

By companion what do you mean? 

Well, in the beginning | assume they were 
husband and wife but, you know, they were not 
married, but | treated her as such. Mrs. Maxwell 
was like the lady of the house. 

Q. Okay. So it was your understanding they 
were in a romantic relationship? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Something like that. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. But they just weren't married? 

A. No, sir. 

Q. So you took instructions from Ms. Maxwell 
as well as Mr. Epstein? 

A. She gave me the instructions of how to 
run the household directly. In other words, she 
likes the towels, the sheets and all that so | 


Page 25 
give the instructions to Louella how to proceed 
with the cleaning and the upkeep of the house. 

Q. You went through the employees who worked 
under you as household manager. Who would you say 
was your direct supervisor, was it both 
Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein? 

A. Mrs. Maxwell. 

Q. Was your supervisor? 

A. Yes, sir. 

Q. I think! interrupted you. You were 
going through the daily routine, and I'm not sure 
you had completed going through what you would do 
in a day. 

A. Until noon we have all the -- we knew 
that the food that was going to be served for 
lunch and dinner. And then in the afternoon it 
was open to shopping, maybe have to drive him to 
the airport to pick up somebody, or answering the 
phones. 

Q. Was there a procedure or protocol for 
answering the phones? 

A. Yes, there was. 

Q. And what was that? 

A. | couldn't relay the message directly to 
Mr. Epstein but take message on a piece of paper

with a copy. 

Q. Were you the only one who was allowed to 
answer the phone? 

A. Yes. 

Q. I'msorry, what would you do -- 

A. | would leave it on the counter next to

Q. Could it be that you said that? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't think so, sir. But 
| don't remember saying an age.

Q. So what was your understanding as to what

Q. And did Mr. Epstein do you know have a 
preference for one massage table or another? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't think so. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:

Page 49 

Q. It was just he would use one of those for 
the massage? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. And the masseuse would come and open the 
table? 

A. | don't know, sir, because | send Louella 
to arrange everything, the table was in place 
already so | don't know who set the table. 

Q. I'm sorry, when you sent Louella? 

A. When we clean the house the table was 
already set so it was not neither us, the 
employees, to go upstairs and set the table, the 
table was already set. 

Q. The table was set in position to give a 
massage? 

A. Yes, 

Q. It was open? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And so it wasn't your understanding that 
Louella had done it?

THE WITNESS: Somebody, yes. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. Okay. You don't know who did it? 

A. No, sir. 

Q. Okay. And what happened after the girl 
completed the massage? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Sometimes | noticed that 
they leave after awhile because they didn't 
tell me when they were leaving, so | was in 
the staff house | was not aware what time 
they leave. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. Sometimes you wouldn't even know that 
they left? 

A. Exactly. 

Q. Okay. About how long were they there do 
you believe? 

A. One hour, two hours. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. Didn't you have to be called to let them 
out? 

A. No. 

Q. | thought there's a code on the door. 


Page 51 

A. Just to get in, to get out you go. 

Q. Okay. Did you have any duties or perform 
any tasks relating to cleanup after the massage? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And what was that? 

A. We used to go with Louella and see to 
replace used towels or sheets in the beds. 

Q. This was after the massage? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Were the beds made in the morning after 
Mr. Epstein woke up? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. So would the sheets need to be 
replaced after the massage? 

A. We couldn't go upstairs unless he will be 
out of the house. So when he leave we used to 
find minutes to go upstairs and put everything 
tidy again. So it was not always a routine. 

Q. Okay. Well, as generally in your 
routine, when would he leave during the course of 
the day? 

A. 10:00 a.m. 1 would say, go for a drive, | 
don't know where they go.

money?

you stay with the car or did you eat with them? 

A. No, | will stay with the car. 

Q. So who did you tip?

restaurant you got to tip the valet otherwise 
you're taking one of the spots. 

Sometimes | used to take -- I'm sorry. 
Aviation, you Know, you need to go to aviation and 
help those guys move your cars around, you need -- 
they carry luggage, so | used to tip those too. 

Q. That would be when you picked up or 
dropped off Mr. Epstein. Correct? 
A. Yes. 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: We'll mark this as an 

exhibit, composite exhibit. 

(Composite Exhibit 1 was marked for 

Identification.) 

MR. CRITTON: Just out of curiosity, on 

depositions are we going to use instead of 


Page 73 
doing plaintiff and defendant designations 
do you just want to run them one, two, 
three, four? 

MR. MERMELSTEIN: That's fine with me as 
long as we remember where we left off. 

MR. CRITTON: Well, are we going to do it 
consecutive with all of the depositions? 

I'm okay with that if someone can keep track 
of that. 

MR. EDWARDS: I've had that go wrong 
before, especially when we have some parties 
who aren't here, such as Mr. Garcia, he's 
going to join depositions, we have to start 
at 27 or whatever. 

MR. CRITTON: For each deposition one 
through whatever without necessarily giving 
them a plaintiff or defendant. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. Mr. Rodriguez, I've marked as Exhibit 1 a

at the bottom. Is that correct?

Q. Let's look at the message next to it. 

MR. CRITTON: Still on page one? 
MR. MERMELSTEIN: Still on page one. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN:

same person. Is that correct? Who is that? 

A. Alicia. 

Q. Who is Alicia? 

A. | don't know, sir. Please tell | effrey 
that | called so | just wrote the name.

through appears to be a different handwriting and 


Page 77 

there is no signature on the bottom. 

A. That's not mine, | don't know who's that 
is, Sir. 

Q. | thought you said earlier you were the 
one who was responsible for taking messages. 

A. Exactly, yes, | was, sir. 

Q. But there were other people who took 
messages as well? 

A. Maybe this is after or before my time, 
Sir. 

Q. Okay. Because there is no date on it. 

A. | used to put my dates and | know | used 
to do that all the time, but you know. 

Q. These style of message pads. It was a 
pad. Correct? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And this is the old fashion message pad 
that it's like duplicate? 

A. Exactly, the original stays with the 
Spiral. 

Q. Okay. So there was a spiral notebook? 

A. Exactly. 

Q. And you would write the message on the 
top copy and then you would take that out and put 
it on the counter in the kitchen?

his messages. Correct? 

A. Yeés, Sir. 

Q. Then there was a carbon copy that was 
with -- that remained with the spiral notebook. 
Correct?

Q. Now, if you look at the way this is 
copied it appears to be that this was taken from 
the spiral notebook. Is that fair to say? 

A. Ye@s, Sir. 

Q. Okay. So it would appear that, for 
example, that these ones that aren't dated are on 
the same pages as the ones that are dated. Is 
that fair to say? 

A. Yes, sir. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. Does that help at all as to who may have 
been the one to take these other messages? 

A. | don't know, sir, | don't know. 

Q. But it's your understanding that no one 
else other than you took messages? 

A. Exactly. 


Page 79

come to give massages? 

A. Probably there were some names there, 
Sir. 

Q. Why were there only some names? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Because it was an informal 
list, you know, it was not like A to Z 
thing, | just write it down sometimes. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. Did Sarah Kellen or Mr. Epstein or 
Ms. Maxwell instruct you to maintain a list of the 
people who came into the house? 

A. No, | do this, this is my job, you know. 
| do this in another place | used to work to have 
those telephone numbers handy because it's

some reference. 

Q. Okay. So this list included a person's 
name? 

A. Yes,

people, they were sometimes, you know, you need to 
have some kind of reference to yourself because 
you have too many information in your head, so it 
was like a cross reference for me that these 
people were in the house before so | used to jot 
around telephone numbers and names. 

Q. And this was a reference you kept for 
yourself? 

A. Yes, it was personal. 

Q. Okay. And that way if you were ever 
asked by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Kellen or Ms. Maxwell 
about someone who had come into the house you 
would have it on your pad? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Were there entries there for each day 
that people came?

Right? 

A. Yes.

time they were there. Correct? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And you would write down their name and 
phone number? 


Page 111 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 
Q. As you indicated this would include girls 
who came for massages. Correct? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And wouldn't the list have been longer 
than four or five pages if it recorded all this 
information about who was coming into the house? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't remember, sir, to 
be honest with you. He probably have it in 
his possession but -- 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 
Q. Okay. So it could have been longer than 
four or five pages; is that what you're saying? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 
Q. It's in Detective Recarey's possession? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Or you haven't seen it since you gave it 
to him? 
A. No. 
Q. Okay. Now, when would you write down the 


WOONA UNBWNFE 





Page 112 
information on this pad? If someone came to the 
front door you would escort them to the kitchen. 
Correct? What point would you get their name and 
phone number? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: At the end of each day | 
will have to prepare stuff for the next day 
so | will always make this is what happened 
today because sometimes it's very hectic so 
| make notes for tomorrow, this is what 
we're going to do, so | used to for my own 
information give these numbers and names, 
like | said, they were not only masseuses 
they were, you know, names of contractors 
that need to get back in the house. Notes 
for myself that was basically instead of 
having a personal computer | used to have 
that. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. When you came to the front door to let 
someone in you had to enter the code on the wall. 
Correct? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Did you have in your hand something to 
write with and a pen? 


Page 113 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No, that was kept in the 
staff house. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. The note pad you're referring to -- 

A. | used to have my own office, | used to 
keep these in my office. 

Q. Okay. Well, I'm trying to -- obviously, 
someone who walked into the house you escorted 
them into the kitchen. Correct? 

A. Yes. 

Q. You didn't memorize their name and phone 
number at that point? 

A. No, but | used to go and write it down. 

Q. Okay. They would give it to you and you 
would go and write it down? 

A. No, no, no. | would escort this lady or 
this person into the house, go to my staff house 
in my office and write it down. 

Q. Okay. But you wouldn't write down her 
telephone number as she gave it to you? 

A. No. 

Q. You would memorize it then write it down 
when you got to the staff house? 

A. | would get it from this.

Page 114 

Q. You would get it from the message pad? 

A. Yeah. Then | will match the name with 
the number as a source of information for me 
because if somebody walks into the house and says, 
I'm Maria, how you going to know really -- it was 
a source of -- it was a tool for making my job 
easier. 

Q. Okay. So if someone walks in the house 
and says they're Maria, then you could always 
cross reference them with a message? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. It would always be a message 
indicating their name and phone number on it? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. And then you would take that and put it 
on your pad? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. So if | understand the 
progression, you would -- the person would come to 
the door, you would escort them into the kitchen, 
they would say I'm Maria, you would then at some 
point during the day you would go to your message 
pad that we looked at was Exhibit 1, you would see 


Page 115 
there was a message with the name Maria and her 
phone number and then you would write it down on 
your yellow pad? 

A. Yes.

MS. EZELL: The main gate, is that what 
you said? 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. MERMELSTEIN: 

Q. Okay. So that was an unplanned visit? 

A. Yes. 

Q. That was after the meeting at the Don 
Shula Hotel or before? 

A. That was before. 

Q. So! understand the sequence, two men 
came to your door when your wife was there. 
Correct? 

A. Actually -- yes, yes, exactly. Then we 
met at the Don Shula. 

Q. So then you met at the Don Shula? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And when did the man come to your house? 

A. |t was like two weeks before that or 
something like that. 

Q. Two weeks before you met at the Don 
Shula? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And what did you discuss when he came to 
your house? 

A. The same questions | told the guy in Don 


Page 135 
Shula, and he sit down in a pad in my house and 
took notes who do | know, the phone numbers, if | 
talk to anybody. That was it. 

Q. And you hadn't spoken to anybody about

one of the same men that you met with at the Don

conducting this investigation and asking you these 
questions and seeking information from you?

to anybody outside the house. | was bound by a 
confidential agreement so | stick to that. 

Q. Okay. So you signed a confidentiality 
agreement with Mr. Epstein? 

Yes, 

Okay. When did you sign that? 

When | was hired. 

And what did that agreement provide? 
| shouldn't discuss anything, you know. 





Page 136 
Q. And your understanding of that was that 
was indefinite, that would last -- 
A. To this day | don't understand the extent 
of that but, you know, | think | did my job and 
I'm out of it, you know. 

At the moment when these people went to 
ask me questions | thought | was bound with that 
confidentiality agreement but because | was 
subpoena in Palm Beach County and they asked me if 
you know this and this and the phone numbers, you 
have to tell the truth. 

Q. Allright. | understand. But you 
understand that a confidentiality agreement -- let 
me strike that. 

| assume your understanding or is your 
understanding -- let me start again. 

Is your understanding that under a 
confidentiality agreement if you're not outside of 
a subpoena, outside of a legal obligation to talk 
with someone you weren't allowed to talk to anyone 
about Mr. Epstein? 

A. Exactly. 

Q. When these investigators came to your 
door did you have to verify that they in fact 
worked for Mr. Epstein?

told me I'm the head of security for Mr. Epstein.

and number and everything. | have probably for 
awhile a business card, but | don't remember their 
names.

business cards still? 

A. Yes, 

Q. What about the confidentiality agreement, 
do you still have that?

Q. So before you spoke with them you called 
Mr. Goldberger?

Page 158 
Epstein was not there obviously the house was shut 
down. When Mr. Epstein was here probably twice a 
week. 
Q. Okay. And going back to C.W., how often 
would you see her? 
A. More often. 
Q. More often then T.? 
A. Yeah. 
Q. If you saw T. twice a week then how often 
would you see C.? 
| will say three to four times. 
Per week? 
Yes. 
And do you remember S.R. at all? 
She goes under another name? 
| wouldn't think so. 
No, | don't remember her. 
Okay. And when you would see either T. 
or C., in what context would you see them; at 
Jeffrey Epstein's house? 
A. Yes. C. used to call me. 
Q. She used to call you directly? 
A. Yeah, no, well, | used to take the 
message from her, | clearly remember that, but not 
S. or -- 


Page 159 

Q. T.? 

A. T. 

Q. When C. would call you what would she 
typically say to you? 

A. | just looking at some of the messages | 
took, that's exactly what it is, | got females for 
him. 

Q. Okay. And when C. herself would come to 
J effrey Epstein's house, what would she come there 
to do? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | assume they were 
massages. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. You thought that C.W. was a 
masseuse? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. You mentioned earlier you have a 
daughter. Right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And your daughter is 20? 

A. 20, and! have a 16 year old. 

Q. C.W. is 21, so back in 2004, 2005, we're 
talking about a 15 year old girl. 

Is that you thought that the 15 year old 





Page 160 
girl was at J effrey Epstein's house, just so the 
record is clear, to give a massage, you thought 
she was a masseuse? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: It's hard to answer to say 
yes or no. At that time -- let me put it 
this way. | saw these girls coming into the 
house to have a good time. But! didn't 
know or! was not interested if it was going 
to be a massage or something else, that was 
my opinion. Now, they look young but, | 
mean, | never thought they were underage. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Do you recall C. when she would 
come to the house she actually had braces when she 
was visiting Mr. Epstein? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't remember that. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. C. when she was coming over the 
house -- I'm using her for an example because it 
seems you remember her the best of T., C., and S. 
Right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. It seemed like she was relatively the age 


Page 161 
of your daughter? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: It's hard to say. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. You wouldn't be shocked to know that she 

was the age of your daughter though. Right? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. And T. the same, | mean, you 
wouldn't be surprised if you learned that she was 
14, 15, 16 years old going over to J effrey 
Epstein's house, that doesn't shock you either. 
Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: (Shakes head.) 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. For the record, | just need you to answer 
out loud. 

A. No. 

Q. Okay. You mentioned that you knew that 
they were coming over, you thought they were 
coming over to have a -- I'll use your words, to 
have a good time. 

What made you believe these girls were

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 55-21 Filed 03/14/16 Page 43 of 69 


Page 162 
coming over to his house to have a good time? And 
then | think you finished by saying | didn't know 
if they were doing massages or something else. 

J ust elaborate on that, what did you mean by that? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Because they were cheerful, 
they were happy, like any young girl, you 
know, they would listen to |-pods, stuff 
like that. | think they were having a good 
time. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Other than being cheerful, happy, 
and listening to |-pods, what else do you remember 
about them that indicated to you that they were 
there to have a good time? 

A. 1 will say that knowing J effrey Epstein 
everybody that will met him he was -- because he 
was a reclusive mysterious man, getting to know 
him that close it was like a matter that you're 
going to get advance in life as modeling or acting 
career or something like that. Even so for men 
that used to go there they will have the probably 
doing business with him. Girls like that, the 
girls like including |'m talking about my girls, 
they like danger, so not danger with him but, | 


Page 163 
mean, that's my opinion, you know, they were 
having a good time, that's what | can say. 

Q. And when you said you're talking about 
your girl, did that mean for that minute you were 
thinking about your own daughter? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And that she would be impressed by 
somebody like Mr. Epstein? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes, exactly. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And somebody -- and that was common of 
visitors of Mr. Epstein to be impressed by him and 
hope that he could reward them by modelling or 
something else? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And getting to know him as well as you 
did, did that seem typical of the clientele or 
guests that would visit his house? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | would say yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Okay. And you called him mysterious and 


WOMONA UBWNFE 





Page 164 
reclusive and obviously you told us about his vast 
wealth. Right? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Are those characteristics things that you 
believe he used to get people over to his house 
such as these girls, C. and T.? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. And when C. or T. -- and just so 
that we're not only talking about C. and T., those 
are two of the girls, but there were also many 
other girls that were relatively the same age as 
C. and T. that came over to his house to have a 
good time. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Can you rephrase that? 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Yes. | mean, you told me that T. came 
over roughly twice a week, and C. came over three 
to four times a week. In addition to C. and T., | 
mean, obviously there is other attorneys in this 
room right now that represent other girls, there 


Page 165 
were many other girls roughly or approximately the 
same age as you would observe as C. and T. that 
came to his house frequently to have a good time? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. During the six month period of time that 
you were there, can you give us your best 
approximation as to the number of girls that would 
come to J effrey's house in that age group of C. 
and T. that were there to have a good time? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. As you've classified it. 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | would say eight. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. There is eight that you remember? 

A. Eight, ten. 

Q. Could be more, could be less? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. But that's your best approximation? 

A. (Shakes head.) 

Q. Do you have the names of these people

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 55-21 Filed 03/14/16 Page 44 of 69 


Page 166 
written down anywhere? 
A. No. 
Q. It's my understanding that C. and T. 
either came to his house alone to visit with Mr. 
Epstein or brought other girls in their age group 
to Mr. Epstein. 
Were you familiar with that type of 
recruitment process of girls bringing other girls? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Can you tell me more about what you know 
about girls bringing other girls that are 
relatively the same age to come to J effrey 
Epstein's house and to use your words, have a good 
time? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: It's hard to know who they 
knew. But! think that was -- they feel 
better themselves when they're in a group 
than going by themselves, but | don't know 
somebody recruiting. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Okay. And you've talked about, at least 
referred to yourself | believe to the police and 


Page 167 
as well today as a human ATM machine. Right? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Something like that. 
supposed to carry cash at all times. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. One of the primary reasons why you 
carried cash was to pay the girls in this age 
group of C. and T. for whatever happened at the 
house. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. That's a fair statement. Right? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. And when C., let's use her for 
example, would bring somebody else to the house, 
did you pay C. as well as whomever she brought to 
the house, pay them both? 

A. No, | pay only one person. 

Q. Okay. My understanding, and tell me if 
this is wrong or you can corroborate this, is that 
Mr. Epstein would pay the girl that was actually 
performing whatever was happening in the room -- 


| was 


ONOAUBWNEH 





Page 168 

for now we'll call it a massage -- as well as 
anybody who brought that person over to the house, 
they would both get paid cash. Are you familiar 
with that? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. IfC. brought another girl over to the 
house and C. stayed downstairs but this other girl 
went upstairs with Mr. Epstein, which one would 
you pay? 
A. | don't know because | was told who to 
pay. 
. And Sarah Kellen always told you? 

Sarah told me pay so and so. 
So if we were going to ask anybody else 
about the exact method in terms of who would get 
paid and for what, who would the people be? | 
mean, other than Mr. Epstein who else could we ask 
these questions? 

Sarah. 

Sarah Kellen? 

Yes. 

She would know this? 

Yes. 


Page 169 
. What about Ghislaine Maxwell? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: You're talking about the 
boss. | don't know. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. To your knowledge was Ghislaine Maxwell 
aware of these girls that are in the age group of 
C. and T. coming to J effrey Epstein's house to 
have a good time? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | have to say something. 
Mrs. Maxwell called me and told me not to 
ever discuss or contact her again in a 
threaten way. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. When was this? 

A. Right after | left because | call one of 
the friends for a job and she told me this, but, 
you know, | feel intimidated and so | want to keep 
her out. 

Q. What exactly did she say? First of all, 
was this a telephone call? 

A. Yes, she was in New York. 

Q. She called you on your cell phone? 

A. Yes.

you by Mr. Epstein? 
A. No, it was my personal phone. | was

Gone? 
Yeah, this is three, four months down the 


So if you left in --

Of 2005?

. And you got a call from Ghislaine Maxwell 
out of the blue? 

A. Yes.

telephone call? 

A. Because | contact somebody in New York to 
get a job. 

Q. Who was that person? 

A. | contact Jean-Luc and | contact Eva, the 
Swedish girl, she used to be very good friends 
with Mr. Epstein because she asked me she need 
somebody in New York. 

Q. What does Eva do? 

A. Eva was a model many years ago and he 


Page 171 
married -- Eva is the mother of the girl who was 
on the wall. 

Q. Who is on the wall of Mr. Epstein's 
house? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. Allright. There is a younger girl model 
that's on the wall of Mr. Epstein's house and this 
lady Eva is her mother? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And at some point in time you called her 
in New York to get a job? 

A. That's right. 

Q. And you also called J ean-Luc Bernell? 
That's his name. Right? 

A. Jean-Luc, yeah, | don't remember his last 
name. 

Q. Does that sound familiar to you, J ean-Luc 
Bernell? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. What did Eva and/or J ean-Luc say about 
employing you? 

A. No, they said they're going to find out 
and obviously the first thing they did was talk to 
Mrs. Maxwell. 

Q. She made a telephone call to you and what 


WOONA UN BRWN FE 





Page 172 
precisely did she say? 

A. She said | forbid you that you're going 
to be -- that | will be sorry if | contact any of 
her friends again. 

Q. Okay. Other than you will be sorry if 
you contact any of my friends again did she say 
anything else about what you know about Mr. 
Epstein and/or what goes on at his house? 

A. She said something like don't open your 
mouth or something like that. But you have to 
understand, I'm a civil humble, | came as an 
immigrant to service people, and right now you 
feel a little -- I'm 55 and I'm afraid. First of 
all, | don't have a job, but I'm glad this is on 
tape because | don't want nothing to happen to me. 
This is the way they treat you, better do this and 
you shut up and don't talk to nobody and -- 

Q. When you say this is the way they treat, 
who specifically are you talking about when you 
say the word they? 

A. Maxwell. 

Q. And usually when you say the word they, 
you're not only talking about one person -- 

A. Wealthy people. 

Q. Are you also putting Jeffrey Epstein in 


Page 173 
that category? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: | didn't talk to him 
directly most of the time. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. What's the reason why if you were his 
head of security that you wouldn't have more 
direct contact with him? Why is that? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: He wanted that way, you 
know, so, yeah, | have to talk to Sarah, 
Sarah is not available talk to Lesley in New 
York. He didn't want to be disturbed. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Even while you were in the same house 
with him he still had other people you could talk 
to directly but he was not one of them? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. When you were fired you were not fired 
directly by him? 

A. No. 

Q. It was through somebody else? 

A. Ms. Maxwell. 

Q. Okay. But it was for upsetting him for 
taking the wrong car?

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 55-21 Filed 03/14/16 Page 46 of 69 


Page 174 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. Ever since this communication that 
Ms. Maxwell made to you where she called you 
sometime in May or J une of 2005, and have you felt 
threatened? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Have you felt reluctant to come forward 
and give truthful, honest, and full disclosure of 
all information that you know about this case? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: | said this off the record 
but | will say it on the record, being in 
the Epstein case for me resulted in two 
years | have -- | won't bring the names but 
| was in the third interview to get hired as 
a household manager in Palm Beach and they 
told me you are the J effrey Epstein guy. 
Not in the sense | did something wrong 
because of the scandal, so they shun the job 
away from me. And so! was afraid that -- 
this is very powerful people and one phone 
call and you finish, so I'm the little guy. 
Even I'm wearing a tie I'm a -- I'm talking 


Page 175 
from my heart. This is the way it is. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. | feel for you, I'm sorry that you have 
to be in this position. 

MR. CRITTON: Move to strike this. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Well, when you applied for these jobs and 
they turned you down and gave you the reason that 
you're the person involved in the J effrey Epstein 
scandal, was it that they are associated or 
friends with J effrey Epstein or is it that you 
have information and you have this confidentiality 
but you're revealing some certain information that 
Mr. Epstein would not like? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Both. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Both? 

A. Both. 

Q. And since then given what you just told 
us about these people being very powerful, are you 
afraid for your life given the fact that you're 
involved to some extent in this case? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | just start thinking about 


ONOAUBWNE 





Page 176 
this. Because | went through -- the first 
time | went to the deposition | was in Palm 
Beach and | did my duty, | mean, | tell what 
| know, but now | know there is more 
digging, all! want is this to be to get on 
with my normal life and stuff. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. So when you come here today to testify, 
your main objective is to get back to your normal 
life and get out of the spotlight of this case. 

Yes? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And in doing so have you held back some 
of the details that you know about that happened 
in this case to remove yourself from the 
spotlight? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No, sir. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Have you ever talked to Ghislaine 
Maxwell after that telephone call where she called 
you and you felt threatened? 

A. No. 

Q. Okay. So going back to where we started 
here was, does Ghislaine Maxwell have knowledge of 


Page 177 
the girls that would come over to J effrey 
Epstein's house that are in roughly the same age 
group as C. and T. and to have a good time as you 
put it? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. And what was her involvement and/or 
knowledge about that? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: She knew what was going on. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. You referred to her at one point in time 
as J effrey Epstein's companion. But then later on 
you said that if she flew she flew on a different 
airplane and oftentimes or sometimes she slept in 
a different bed from Mr. Epstein. Did that seem 
unusual to you? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: It was odd but, | mean, and 
again, everything is odd in Palm Beach. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Okay, | don't mean to laugh. 
A. Mr. Epstein fly to J et Aviation, she fly 
to Galaxy Aviation, but they never flew the same

plane, | don't know why. 

And did you ever find out why? 

No. 

You never really inquired why? 

No. 

That wasn't your job? 

(Shakes head.) 

You were just there to do your job? 

Exactly. 

Obviously at some point in time you see 
these girls coming over to Mr. Epstein's house to 
have a good time and over time you start wondering 
what is going on with Mr. Epstein and these girls. 
Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And you understand that Mr. Epstein is a 
wealthy person that could have the best masseuse 
in the world come to his house. Yes? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. These were not professional masseuses 

that were coming to his house to give massages. 


Page 179 


Right? 


MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. They were not? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: They were not the best but 
they say they were masseuses. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. They said that or Sarah Kellen said that? 
Who is they? Is it Sarah Kellen and J effrey 
Epstein or is it C. and T. that would come and 
announce themselves as masseuses? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: We wanted to put the title 
masseuse. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Who is we? 

A. We the staff and Sarah. 

Q. Who taught you that these girls that are 
in T. and C. age group should be referred to as 
masseuses? Who taught you that title? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | just heard them, you 
know. 





Page 180 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Who heard who? 
A. | heard Sarah going to be coming to give 
a massage. 
Q. Okay. When the girls would come in to 
Mr. Epstein's house, would you be the first one to 
meet them and greet them or would that be Sarah? 
A. Me. 
Q. And if C. came would she normally come 
alone or with somebody else? 
A. Sometimes she had a companion sometimes 
she was by herself. 
Q. Given C.'s age you never truly believed 
she was there as a masseuse; did you? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: From the father point of 
view, no. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. And that in conjunction with the fact 
that when she called she gives you messages such 
as | have girls to bring for Mr. Epstein lead you 
to believe that there was something more going on 
then massages at Mr. Epstein's house with these 
girls? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 


Page 181 
THE WITNESS: When | was working | didn't 
have the time to realize that, but now 
you're out and you start -- yes, it is more 
than that. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And when C. would come over and she would 
bring a companion, who would lead them to the area 
-- | guess it's the upstairs bedroom, who would 
lead them up there, would it be Sarah or would it 
be yourself? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Sarah. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Let's say two of them come over, | know 
that there is numerous times that she is coming 
three or four times a week for the six month 
period that you're there, but if it is C. and 
another companion, and that other companion would 
usually be roughly her age. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: It was something like that. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. | mean, there were not people bringing 
over massage tables to give him a massage, these 
were girls who were C. and T. age, approximately,

upstairs would they go into the room with Mr.

THE WITNESS: 


Page 183 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Just your fatherly instinct told you 
that; is that it? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And when T. would come over would she 
normally bring others with her? 

A. Usually they came in couples, but 
sometimes | wouldn't say never happened but 
probably they were by themselves. 

Q. Okay. But your feeling was when they 
came in groups was because they felt more 
comfortable in a group? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS:

Q. You didn't? 

A. No. 

Q. I'm going to go to the police report that 
we have that mentions your name in it in several 
places. All right. | think the first time that 
we find your name is page 50 at the bottom. This 
is not a transcript of any statement that you gave 
so | want to read some of it and you tell me is 
this accurate or does it accurately reflect what 
you told Detective Recarey. Okay. 

A. Okay. 

MR. CRITTON: Just object to the 
procedure. | think that's improper, if 
you're trying to accredit him it's improper, 
if you're trying to impeach him it's 
improper. But go, do what you want. 

MR. EDWARDS: | said it's not a 
statement. Do you want to give me the 
statement? 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Mr. Rodriguez stated he had worked with 
Epstein for approximately six months after the 
previous houseman left. Correct? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Yes. 


Page 185 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. He stated that it was his responsibility 
to keep the identity of the masseuses private. 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And is that something that you told Mr. 
-- Detective Recarey that it was your 
responsibility to keep the identity of the 
masseuses private? 

A. That was part of my job. 

Q. Who delegated that particular 
responsibility, is that Sarah Kellen or J effrey 
Epstein? 

A. Sarah Kellen. 

Q. What specifically did she tell you about 
keeping the identity of the masseuses private? 

A. Everything in the house was confidential. 
And we didn't -- several times, you know, whatever 
was going on in the house Sarah told me, you know 
you're not suppose to say this, we know because | 
signed 27 pages of confidentiality agreement. 

Q. The confidentiality agreement that you 
referred to earlier was 27 pages long?

Q. You've worked for other people in a 
similar fashion in terms of being a housekeeper. 
Right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And with each of those people did you 
have to sign a confidentiality agreement? 

A. No. 

Q. That's something that only applied to 
your position with J effrey Epstein? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Who did you work for? I'm going to come 
back to this. Who did you work for just prior to 
Mr. Epstein? 

A. Mr. Arturo Torres in Fisher Island. 

MR. EDWARDS: Do you need a spelling? 
THE WITNESS: T-O-R-R-E-S. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Okay. Did you have to sign a 
confidentiality agreement with him? 
No.

Yes. 
And how long did you work for him? 
Four years and two different occasions. 
One in Fisher Island? 
One in Fisher Island, the other one in 


his ranch i in Texas. 

Q. Why did you leave him and start with Mr. 
Epstein? 

A. His health declined and he didn't need 
anybody like me so he moved back to Spain, he came 
once in awhile, | used to take care of his car, 
and then finally he passed away two years ago. 

Q. After you were relieved of your duties 
with Mr. Epstein where is the next place where you 
were employed? 

A. | worked for Sidney Goldman, a gentleman 
in Fort Lauderdale, a wealthy individual also, he 
was in his 80's, and | did some functions. 

Q. Okay. How long did you work for him? 

A. Probably six months. 

Q. And why did you stop there? 

A. Because he also 83 or 84 at the time and 
they start reducing staff. He used to go out, he 
didn't need a chauffeur so they slash one of my 





Page 188 
duties and then | started work for Mrs. Hammond. 
Q. And where was that? 
A. In Palm Beach. 
Q. How long did you work there? 
A. For Mrs. Hammond on and off for two or 
three years.

the people that you worked for ever get massages 
at their house?

Q. And did you see the masseuse that would 
show up? 
Yes. 
Male or female? 
Female. 
And what age group was that masseuse? 
Actually she was older, 40's. 
Did she bring a massage table or was 
there one in the house? 


Page 189 

There was one in the house. 

There was one? 

Yeah. 

And what about that person told you that 
that i is a legitimate masseuse when they showed up 
at Ms. Hammond's house? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Nothing, just maybe 
Ms. Hammond tried it the first time and she 
liked it, you know, nothing indicated to me, 
| didn't see her license or anything. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Was this specific responsibility that 
we're talking about your responsibility to keep 
the identity of the masseuses private, was that 
something that Sarah Kellen told you more than 
once after you signed the confidentiality 
agreement? 

A. | believe so. 

Q. And why would that subject matter come up 
to where she would need to reiterate that? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Maybe for directions from 
the boss. 

MR. CRITTON: Move to strike a guess.

Page 190 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. When you were at his house, | think you 
said earlier that he would get one or two massages 
everyday he was there. Is that right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And each of the massages, just so we're 
clear, that you're talking about are given by the 
girls that are in the age group of C. and T. that 
were at his house to have fun. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: | didn't know who was 
giving the massages but obviously the 
massages was going on. But! don't know how 
to answer your question. | don't know if 
these girls giving the massage itself. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. No, no, no. You're misunderstanding my 
question, or I'm just not communicating well with 
you. 

I'm not saying there was a massage or not 

a massage going on. I'm saying that you were 
taught to label these girls as masseuses. Right? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 


Page 191 

Q. And when we're talking about these girls, 
we are talking about the group of girls that would 
come to his house that are roughly in the age 
group of C. and T. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: More or less. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. We're not talking about some professional 
massage service that would show up at his house to 
give a massage, that's not what we're talking 
about. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: It's hard to say. It's 
hard to say because there are young 
masseuses too. It's hard to say. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Well, you testified that some of them 
would show up in taxicabs. Right? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. That's a little odd for a masseuse. 

Right? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: (Shakes head.) 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. | mean, that's one indication that this 


ONAUBWNEH 





Page 192 
is not a professional masseuse that's showing up 
at his house, they're showing up in a taxicab. 
Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. So that's something else that you as 
somebody who has common sense had told you that 
these are young girls that are at his house to 
have fun and that has very little, if anything, to 
do with a massage. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Right? 
MR. CRITTON: Form, argumentative. 
THE WITNESS: In fairness it's hard to 
say. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. What was going on behind closed doors? 

A. Exactly. 

Q. Why earlier did you say you had the 
feeling that there was something more going on 
than a masseuse? 

A. In terms of fun. You don't know if it's 
-- | have to say this. Some of this lawsuit is 


Page 193 
because forceful violation or something of a girl, 
| mean a rape. Okay. So it's hard to say if it 
was nothing except having fun. 

MR. CRITTON: Let me put an objection in, 
move to strike, I'm not sure what that was 
responsive to. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. We're talking about a time period when 
Mr. Epstein is 50 years old plus, and we're 
talking about these girls coming over to his house 
that are 14, 15, or 16 years old, and you're 
categorization is they're just there to have fun. 
Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Is that what you asked me? 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Yes. 

A. Yes, 

Q. Okay. And that in your mind was okay or 
that was strange or that was it's none of my 
business? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: | have to say yes or no or 
| have to give my opinion on that?

Q. Sure, go ahead and answer however you 
want. 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't think it was right. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Did you ever voice that opinion that you 
didn't think that it was right that these young 
girls were over behind closed doors upstairs with 
Mr. Epstein in his bedroom? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | been asked that question 
before. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Excuse me? 
A. | been asked that question before. 
Q. By whom? 
A. Palm Beach Police Department. 
Q. Did you give the same answer that you did 
not think it was right? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. And what about it to you aside from the 
fact that you had a daughter roughly the same age, 
what besides that told you that it wasn't right? 


Page 195 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Ask me your question again. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. My question is, why is it your opinion 
that it wasn't right for these young girls to be 
up in Mr. Epstein's -- 

A. It wasn't. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. It wasn't right? 

A. It wasn't. 

Q. And why not? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Because I'm a father, | 
have two daughters. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And given Mr. Epstein's wealth and power 
and influence, is that something that you as a 
father could have seen your daughters doing at 
that age? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't think that my 
daughters would be doing that. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. You would hope not. 





Page 196 

A. No, exactly. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. | think that the next time you're 
mentioned in the report, | believe it's page 70. 
MS. EZELL: Off the record briefly. 

(Thereupon, a discussion was had off the 
record.) 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Page 64. It says, Alfredo Rodriguez 
resides in Miami had eluded, meaning you were 
trying to evade or avoid service of process 
servers previously and was not served the 
investigative subpoena. 

This is an investigator saying you just 
weren't home or something. Right? 

A. But! never elude anybody. 

Q. You never intentionally tried to avoid 
the police officers? 

A. No, no, never. 

Q. Okay. 

MR. CRITTON: So much for the police 
report. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Allright. The bottom of page 70 says, | 


Page 197 
brought Mr. Rodriguez to the interview room. 
Were you taken to an interview room, to a 
room in the police department? 
A. This was in the District Attorney's 
Office. 
Q. Oh, it was at the State Attorney's 
Office? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. Was a State Attorney there as 
well? 
A. Yes, Mrs. Weiss. 
Q. Daliah Weiss? 
A. Young lady, Weiss. D-E-I-S-S. 
Q. Okay. | have D-A-L-Il-A-H, Daliah Weiss, 
W-E-I-S-S. 
Yes, 
That's her? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Did she ask you any questions? 
Both of them. 
Okay. So it was both -- if there is a -- 
| think you said earlier there is a taped 
statement, there is a tape of this? 
A. Yes. 
Q. If we listen to that tape if we ever get

Page 198 
that tape it's going to be Assistant Attorney 
Weiss and Detective Recarey asking questions? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Itsays, during the sworn taped statement 
Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by J effrey 
Epstein for approximately six months. 

| think we already talked about that. 
I'm skipping ahead a little bit. 

|f Rodriguez needed to relay a message to 
Epstein he would have to notify Epstein's 
secretary Lesley in New York who would then notify 
Epstein's personal assistant Sarah who would relay 
the message to Epstein. 

A. Yeah. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. That's pretty much the process you 
described? 

A. Yes, it was normal procedure. 

Q. Rodriguez stated Epstein did not want to 
see or hear the staff when he was in the 
residence? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: That's correct. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 


Page 199 
Q. That's something you agree with? 
A. Yes. 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Rodriguez advised Mr. Epstein had many 
guests. 
In addition to the girls who are roughly 
C. and T. age who had come to the house to have a 
good time, who were some of the other guests that 
you know of, if you know their name? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | mentioned Alan 
Dershowitz. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. That's a lawyer from Harvard? 
A. Yes. The magician, David Copperfield, 
some other lawyers from New York, you know. There 
were some other guests. 
Q. And how frequently would these other 
guests come over? 
A. Once a month, something like that. 
Q. Okay. So if it's only once a month and 
you were only there six months you're saying you 
only saw six guests come over in addition to -- 
A. They have people, you know, they have 


WOONA UN BWNFE 





Page 200 
friends, | will say, yeah. 

Q. Then you mentioned that you typed into 
Google, | guess you Googled Prince Andrew and Bill 
Clinton. Why would you pick those names, were 
they associated with Mr. Epstein? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And what is your understanding as to how 
Prince Andrew is associated with J effrey Epstein? 

A. Because there were pictures with him 
together. 

. Inthe house? 
Yes. 
Many pictures or are we talking about 
one? 

A. Many pictures. 

Q. Were these pictures that looked that 
appeared to be at social events, at Mr. Epstein's 
house or where? 

A. Mrs. Maxwell took him to England to 
introduce him to the royalty. 

Q. Is it's your understanding that Ghislaine 
Maxwell knew Prince Andrew and introduced -- 

A. Yes. 

Q. Is it also your understanding that at 
some point in time Ghislaine dated or had a 


Page 201 
romantic relationship with Prince Andrew? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't know that. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Do you know around what time period it 
was that Mr. Epstein was introduced to Prince 
Andrew? 

2003, | believe. 

How do you know that? 

I've heard dates. 

From people in the Epstein group? 

Yes, 

Okay. 

MR. CRITTON: Let me note my objection, 
move to strike, it's based on -- his 
testimony is based on hearsay. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. During the six month period of time when 
you worked directly for Mr. Epstein, how often did 
Mr. Epstein get together with or hangout with 
Prince Andrew; if you know? 

A. | didn't see him once. 

Q. You never saw Prince Andrew at the house? 

A. No, no, he called. 

Q. I'm sorry, how often would he call?

Page 202 

A. | will say once a week we used to get a 
call from him. 

Q. Did you ever hear or did you ever know of 
Prince Andrew being involved with any of the same 
girls that J effrey Epstein was involved? 

A. No. 

Q. Allright. Same question with Bill 
Clinton, were you ever aware of him being involved 
with any girls? 

A. No. 

Q. And David Copperfield? 

A. No. 

Q. What would he do when he was in town? 

A. He came to the house, played tricks and 
he leave. 

Q. Did you watch? 

A. Yeah. Cards and -- 

Q. That's nice, you get an up close and 
personal show from David Copperfield. 

How often would David Copperfield and 
Jeffrey Epstein talk? 

A. When | was there he was maybe two or 
three times in the house. 

Q. Besides those guests have you pretty much 
listed the guests that you were aware of? 


Page 203 
A. Mr. Dershowitz was there, | took him two 
or three times to the airport. And like I say, 
lawyers from New York, business matters. 
Q. Okay. And Donald Trump, did you ever see 
him at the house? 
A. No, he used to call. 
Q. Is it your understanding that -- or 
through your knowledge do you know if Donald Trump 
owned or runs the Mara Lago Club? 
Yes. 
Did Mr. Epstein go to the Mara Lago Club? 
No. 
. Why not? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: He's a very private person. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. So it's your understanding that Mr. 
Epstein didn't go to the Mara Lago Club just 
because he's private? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Are you aware, has he ever been there? 
A. That! don't know. 
Q. Do you know if he's a member? 





Page 204 
A. Probably is. 
MR. CRITTON: Form, move to strike, it's 
a guess, speculation. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. When you say he probably is, what are you 
basing that on? 

A. Because he belongs to all the clubs in 
Palm Beach. 

Q. Okay. But you don't have a list of all 
of the clubs that he belongs to? 

| used to. 

And on that list -- 

| don't remember, you know. 

Okay. Do you know where that list is? 

Probably it's in the house. 

Skipping down on page 71 of the report to 
the third paragraph, Rodriguez stated once the 
masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry 
into the kitchen area and offer them something to 
eat or drink. Do you agree with that? 

A. Yes, 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. They would then be encountered by Sarah 
or Epstein. 


Page 205 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: (Shakes head.) 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Yes? 

A. (Shakes head.) 

Q. They would then be taken upstairs to 
provide a massage. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Again, you don't know what happened 
behind closed doors? 

A. No. 

Q. But you were told to refer to these girls 
as masseuses? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Aside from being told that, you have 
absolutely no idea what went on up there? 

A. No. 

Q. Allright. | asked Rodriguez any of the 
masseuses appeared to be young in age, he advised 
he didn't ask their ages but felt they were very 
young. 

A. Early 20's, you know. They're all very 
young, but | mean, it's hard to say who's underage

now, you know. It's a fine line, you know. 

Q. Okay. You didn't ask their ages? 

A. No. 

Q. And these are the masseuses where you 
were told to keep their identities private anyway? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Rodriguez stated they would eat tons of 

cereal and drink milk all the time. Is that true? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. So the masseuses would come over and 
either before or after going up to Mr. Epstein's 
bedroom they would go to the kitchen and eat 
cereal and milk? 

And ice cream. 
That's what the kids would eat? 
(Shakes head.) 
Yes? 
. Yes. 
MR. CRITTON: Let me object to the form 
of the last question. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 


Page 207 

Q. Rodriguez stated the girls that would 
come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. 

Is that something you agree with? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Some of them, you know. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Especially when we're talking about C. 
and T, those girls, they appeared to be too young 
to be masseuses. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. He stated one time under Epstein's 
direction he delivered a dozen roses to Royal Palm 
Beach High School for one of the girls that came 
to provide a massage. 

And that is the -- that is the girl that 
we talked about earlier, A.? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. And that's a girl who also came 
over to Mr. Epstein's house and was one of the 
girls who was up in the bedroom privately with Mr. 
Epstein at times. Right?

THE WITNESS: But he was in the house. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. You don't know why she was there? 

A. Honestly the truth, you know, | cannot 
say, they all came for the same motive but -- 

Q. To have fun? 

A. To have fun. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Let me try to figure this out 
then. They all came over in your mind to have 
fun. 

Did you ever see any contact between 
Epstein, Mr. Epstein, and any of these girls other 
than whatever contact he was having with them in 
the bedroom? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: No, no. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. So when you say they came over to 
have fun, you're talking about whatever fun was 
going on behind closed doors in the bedroom? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: They go to the pool during 

the daytime. 


Page 209 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Without Mr. Epstein? 

A. With Mr. Epstein. 

Q. He would go with them? 

A. (Shakes head.) 

Q. Do you ever remember C. or T. or A. 
going to the pool with Mr. Epstein? 

A. The pool was used everyday, so probably 
they were there, but | cannot -- | cannot say yes, 
| saw her, you know. 

Q. So you know that some of these girls who 
were -- who you labelled as masseuses that were 
very young in age came over to the house and they 
oftentimes used the swimming pool area but you 
can't say that any of those girls were C. or T. 
or A.? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No, because when they were 
at the pool it was off limits for any of the 
staff. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Why is that? Is that in the rule book? 

A. No, because they were naked. Louella 
told me to leave them alone, so until they leave 
the area we couldn't go, so we couldn't -- |

specifically what is the current name, address, 
and telephone number of each person that resided 
or worked within the home located at 358 EI Brillo 
Way, West Palm Beach, between 2001 to the present. 

The answer was -- and just so the record 
is very clear in terms of what the answer was 
talking about, plaintiff's complaint alleges a 
time period of approximately August 2002 and 
continuing until approximately September 2005, so 
the answer is within that time period of 2002 and 
2005.

A. Could be. 

Q. Is that somebody who would also have had 
to sign this confidentiality agreement? 

A. Yes, 

Q. And in addition to you signing this 
confidentiality agreement is that an agreement 
that you know all of the staff working with 
Jeffrey Epstein had to sign?

that they pulled these message pads out of the

message pads from the trash?

And that's something you told us about 
earlier. Right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Then it says, he knew the girls were 
still in high school and were of high school age. 

Speaking of the girls who were coming 
over labelled as masseuses, is that something -- 
(Thereupon, an interruption was had.) 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. The statement is, he knew the girls were 
still in high school and were of high school age. 
That's something you agree with? 

MR. CRITTON: Form, out of context. 
THE WITNESS: | saw them in high school. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 


Page 219 

Q. The girls that we were talking about, and 
I'm talking about C. and T. specifically, but 
these are girls that looked of high school age to 
you. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: It's hard to say. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. That wouldn't shock you though? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Doesn't surprise you? 
A. No. 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS:

felt there was a lot more going on than just 
massages. 
Is that something you told him? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Do you know if it was a feeling that -- 
well, let me ask you this way. 

Did you ever talk about that feeling that 


OONA UN BWNFE 





Page 220 
there was more going on than just massages with 
anybody else that worked at the house? 

A. No. 

Q. Did you talk about that with anybody 
else? 

A. No, nothing. This is the first time that 
| said this openly because | was subpoenaed and 
there were these things, you know. 

Q. Right. And right now is the second time 
you Said it openly because you're subpoenaed 
again? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Otherwise you have not expressed those 
feelings to anybody else? 

A. No. 

Q. What about when you spoke with Mr. 
Epstein's attorneys or investigators, did you talk 
to them about that? 

A. No. 

Q. And why did you choose not to tell them 
that you felt there were more -- that there was 
more going on in the bedroom with these young 
girls than just massages? 


Page 221 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: The only reason | contacted 
the attorneys was to see what's my position 
because | didn't have money to go to an 
attorney myself. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Why would you feel like you may need an 
attorney though if you didn't do anything wrong? 

A. | didn't need an attorney. 

Q. You were just frightened by the process? 

A. The process and the people who was 
involved in this. 

Q. The people involved meaning Ghislaine 
Maxwell and J effrey Epstein? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. I'll ask you, which people are you 
talking about? 

A. Ghislaine Maxwell. 

Q. And were you still frightened because of 
the threat that she -- 

A. | don't think so now, you know, I'm 
protected because I'm doing this publicly. 

Q. Okay. Well, going back to my other 
question about why didn't you reveal to Mr.

Page 222 
Epstein's investigators that you felt there was 
more going on in the bedroom than just massages? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Because they were more 
interested in how much | know, they didn't 
ask me anything else, and | told them 
exactly what | knew and what | was doing. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. You were asked by Mr. Mermelstein 
when he was asking you about the meeting with Mr. 
Epstein's investigators he said, did they make any 
threat or did they threaten you, and you paused 
and said | don't believe so. 

A. Yeah, | think they didn't tell me 
anything that | will feel -- they told me that 
they want to know what | know and if | need an 
attorney. 

Q. Okay. Did you find that strange at all 
that they offered you an attorney? 

A. | went to have dinner at my house and | 
told this to my wife and she told me, Alfredo, you 
don't need an attorney, so | called him the next 
day and that was it. 

Q. You called the investigators? 

A. Yes. | declined, | don't need an 


Page 223 
attorney. 

Q. If we want to know the exact names of the 
investigators that you met at Don Shula's and at 
your house, how would we get that information, do 
you have it somewhere? 

A. Probably | have it in the house. 

Q. So if we do have to come back here and 
finish this up, the next time would you be able to 
bring that? 

A. | think so. 

Q. Okay. Do you know where in your house 
that you have it, | mean, have you kept it in a 
certain place? 

A. | have to look. 

Q. Allright. After the sentence that we 
left off it says, he, speaking of Mr. Rodriguez, 
would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the 
alleged massages and would discover massagers 
slash vibrators and sex toys scattered on the 
floor. 

Can you tell us what types of sex toys 
that you found scattered on the floor after the 
massages with these young girls? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Like! explain, there was a 





Page 224 
massage with a handle with two rubber things 
that you can do massage yourself, this was 
always on the floor, maybe one or two. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. When you say this is always on the 
floor, do you mean 24 hours a day it's on the 
floor? 

A. No, no, no, after each massage. Because 
| assume the masseuses or anybody they were doing, 
they were taken out of the closet wherever they 
belong and they would leave there. So Louella and 
myself, we always find this on the floor. 

Q. And this is a massager that belongs to or 
is owned by Mr. Epstein? 

A. Yes. 

Q. This isn't something that these girls 
would bring over to the house? 

A. No, no, it's in the house, it's part of 
the inventory. 

Q. And that statement is a few statements 
after you felt that there was a lot more going on 
than just massages, is there something about that 
object being left on the ground and the type of 
object that it was that also lead you to believe 
that there is something more going on here than 


Page 225 


just massages? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 


THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. What about it, just tell us? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: | thought they were having 
a good time, | never thought it was 
something done against anybody's will, but 
of course, you know that it's more than 
massage. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Right, I'm just asking you to explain how 
you know that. 

MR. CRITTON: Let me just move to strike 
his last answer as speculation. Form as to 
your statement. 

THE WITNESS: You're 50 years old and 
it's -- you're an old -- you know, it's just 
instinct. 

MR. CRITTON: Move to strike. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. It was obvious to you? 
A. Yes. 
MR. CRITTON: Form.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. He also said he would wipe down the 
vibrators and sex toys and put them away in the 
armoire. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: These things have a tip, 
they have the cream, they have all kinds of 
cream for giving massage. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. How many of these massagers or vibrators 
would you wipe down? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: This big one all the time. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Right. Other than the big one all the 
time did you wipe down at any time any of the 
other sex toys or vibrators? 

A. No. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. So if there were any other sex toys or 
vibrators or | believe you used the term dildo 
earlier that were ever used, those are items that 
you did not find on the floor and were put away in 
the armoire? 


Page 227 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Louella told me | did this, 
| did that. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. So tell us what did Louella tell you? 

A. She find toys on the floors, she have to 
clean them. 

Q. Did she tell you when she found the toys 
on the floor? 

A. After his massages, you know. 

Q. With the young girls that we're talking 
about? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. And when did Louella tell you 
that? 

A. Almost every other time when she found 
it, you know, Alfredo | found this thing again 
because she despised to clean this, she had to put 
the gloves or whatever. 

Q. Okay. So it sounds like you had an 
actual conversation about this where she's 
describing she doesn't want to clean it. 

A. Because | told her to tell me up to date 
on things that are not normal, so she told me, you 
know, | found this, | found that, or some 





Page 228 
underwear she brought it to the laundry and we 
used to label it. 

Q. Just so that the record is clear as to 
what we're talking about with this and that, | 
want you to tell us what Louella would tell you 
specifically, | found this and then would she show 
you what it was? 

A. No, she didn't show me, she said | 
cleaned this and | put it away, it was a vibrator. 

Q. Did she describe the vibrator for you so 
that you knew which one she was talking about? 

A. The vibrator that a female would use for 
personal use. 

Q. Not the same long one that you've been 
describing? 

A. No. 

Q. One that is a penis shaped vibrator. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. That's what she was talking about? 

A. Yes, 

Q. And did she tell you on how many 
occasions after these -- 

A. Several times. 


Page 229 

Q. And can you explain to us why it is that 
-- and maybe it's just | don't understand the 
process of cleaning the room who went in first and 
second and whatever, but my question is why is it 
that she would always be the one to encounter the 
penis shaped vibrators and you would encounter 
this other longer vibrator? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Because it was her job to 
clean the room. When she was busy she will 
ask me, Alfredo, can you help me carry, | 
have a lot of towels, because there were 
mountains because being an older woman | 
help her carry to the -- and put the towels 
downstairs, take it to the laundry. But she 
told me | found these things, | clean it, | 
put it in that armoire, they're over there. 

So she will give me -- we used to 
communicate all those little details, but it 
was her job to be in the room first. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And what did she say about liking or 
disliking the fact that she had to clean these 
vibrators? 

A. She didn't like to clean those.

Page 230 

Q. Did she tell you why? 

A. Because, you know, she knew what they 
were for and probably she despised to clean 
objects. 

Q. Did she ever make any comments about how 
young the girls were that were in the room with 
Mr. Epstein just before she had to go in and clean 
these vibrators? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Is the age of the girls that were coming 
over and going behind closed doors with Mr. 

Epstein a subject that ever came up between you 
and Louella? 

A. Sometimes. 

Q. And what would the conversation consist 
of? 

A. She will be surprised and say some of the 
girls are too young, and | said -- we just wonder, 
you know, but we comment each other. 

Q. Did it ever -- as a father did it ever 
occur to you that maybe | should say something or 
| shouldn't be here or | shouldn't be apart of 
this considering how young they are and how old he 


Page 231 
is? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Is that something that on more than one 
occasion you thought to yourself this is just 
wrong? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And did you ever have a conversation with 
Louella about the fact that that's not right? 

A. We had. 

Q. And Louella stayed there and she's still 
employed there? 

A. | believe she was. 

Q. And did she ever mention to you that she 
thought that the situation was wrong and that she 
was contemplating -- 

A. She was a deeply religious -- 

MR. CRITTON: Form to the last question. 
THE WITNESS: -- Catholic Filipino girl 
-- lady, and one day she came crying because 
she found a picture of the Pope next to 
naked girl, both pictures, and she said it's 


WOONAUBWNFE 


Page 232 
a lack of respect. So, you know, she was 
shocked. So obviously she needed a job but 
she expressed her -- 

MR. WILLITS: I'm sorry, | did not hear 
that, could the witness repeat that? 

THE WITNESS: | was just talking about 
Louella, deeply religious staff member that 
worked with me and she told me one occasion 
that she was crying because the picture of 
the Pope was next to a naked girl. 

MR. WILLITS: Okay. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Besides Louella did you ever have 
a conversation with anybody else that works in the 
house about the young age of the girls and Mr. 
Epstein being in the bedroom and the fact that 
there are sex toys on the floor afterwards being 
wrong? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Nobody else inside the 
house was allowed except just the two of us, 
so | never commented on this with anybody. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Allright. The next sentence starts a 
new paragraph, Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to 


Page 233 
the Dollar Rent a Car and rent a car for the same 
girl he brought the roses to. 

| guess we're talking about A. 

So that she could drive herself to 
Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said 
the girl always needed rides to and from the 
house. 

Are those statements you agree with? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: | took her a few times to 

her house. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. You took A. to and from her house? 

A. In Royal Palm Beach. 

Q. Okay. Did she say anything in the car to 
you about what was going on in the bedroom with 
Mr. Epstein?

a minimum when | was with them because it was my

to that are roughly the same age as a daughter 
that you have? 

A. Yeah.

to or from their homes? 

A. | don't remember but if it was somewhere

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Did any of the girls ever talk to you in 
the car about anybody else that they ever gave a 
massage to? 

A. No, they were very private. 

Q. Rodriguez referred to himself as a human 
ATM machine and was ordered by Epstein to maintain 
a minimum balance of $2,000 on him at all times. 

That's something you've told us already. 
Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. When a girl would come by the house and 
Mr. Epstein was either not in the residence or was 
not at home at the time Rodriguez was to provide 
the girl, in parenthesis, masseuse, several 
hundred dollars for their time and to notify 
Epstein the amount they were given. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Well, | have to give this 
report to the comptroller in New York to 
keep track of the cash. | never talk to Mr. 





Page 236 
Epstein. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Okay. But this is talking about a 
situation where girls come to the house, and these 
young girls come to the house and Mr. Epstein is 
not at the house at all. That happened? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Well, they left and -- 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Wait. Who are you talking about? 
A. Mr. Epstein, the girls, and Sarah, they 
go away. 
Q. You're talking about a different set of 
girls now, now you're talking about the girls that 
fly with him on the airplane. 
A. Exactly. But they're out of the house. 
But Sarah will call me and leave me instructions 
on my phone that | have to pay so and so and they 
will be there this evening or this afternoon, 
that's why there was nobody in the house but | 
still have to pay them. 
Q. Okay. Would these girls usually arrive 
by taxicab and you would have to pay them? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Sometimes taxi and 


Page 237 
sometimes their own cars. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And you mentioned that you would 
sometimes be the person to call them a cab. 
Right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. How did you know which cab service to 
use? 

A. Weused to have in the house two or three 
numbers and people knew the house because 
sometimes it was hard to -- it was easy to get 
lost to get to the house. 

Q. So were there certain taxicab drivers 
that you would ask to come specifically? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Who? 

A. | don't remember, but they knew the house 
right away, it's like Joe, come here, | need you. 

Q. Would you have that name of that person 
that would typically drive these girls, you know, 
in taxicabs to and from the house anywhere? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | don't think so. 
BY MR. EDWARDS:

Cab Company? 

A. West Palm Beach Taxi. No, it's not 
Yellow. Could be Yellow, but | don't know. 

Q. Would Mr. Epstein have the names or the 
list? 

A. Probably. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Anybody else? 

A. Sarah. 

Q. Sarah would have? 

A. Yes. 

Q. In addition to Mr. Epstein obviously 
knowing who's coming to and from the house, would 
Sarah also be familiar with the names of the girls 
and who they were? 

A. Yes. 

Q. In addition to Sarah and Mr. Epstein 
would Ghislaine Maxwell be familiar with the names 
of some of these girls? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Are these names kept in a database in a 

computer system? 


Page 239 

A. Could be. 

MR. CRITTON: I'm sorry, did you say 
could be? 
THE WITNESS: Yeah. 
MR. CRITTON: Move to strike as 
speculation. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. When you say could be, why do you say 
that? 

A. Because there were too many and they were 
very organized and there is nothing you write on a 
piece of paper. 

Q. When you say they were very organized, 
are we talking -- 

A. Mr. Epstein and Sarah. 

Q. Anybody else beside Mr. Epstein and 
Sarah, | guess beside Sarah that would do the 
scheduling to coordinate the times these girls 
would come to the house? 

A. |'m sorry, anybody else you say? 

Q. Right, aside from Sarah. 

A. No, no. 

Q. And do you know what role, if any, Nadia 
Marcenacova ever played in any of what would go on 
behind the bedroom door with Mr. Epstein? 





Page 240 

A. Nadia was the number one girlfriend for 
Mr. Epstein. Very sweet girl, and she was always 
-- she would come over to the house but different 
girls with her all the time. 

Q. Okay. But Nadia, that's somebody who 
lives in New York? 

A. Nadia, | believe, yes, her address is in 
New York. 

Q. So how often would she stay at 358 El 
Brillo? 

A. Very often. 

Q. Usually every time when Mr. Epstein was 
there? 

A. Yes, 

Q. And she would for the most time fly on 
the plane with Mr. Epstein? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And it would be her and Mr. Epstein and 
oftentimes some other girls? 

A. Exactly. 

Q. Where some points | think earlier when 
Mr. Mermelstein was asking you questions where 
there was some confusion was we're talking about 
two different sets of girls, the girls that would 
come over and be labelled masseuses from the Palm 


Page 241 
Beach area, and the girls that would fly on the 
plane with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Marcenacova. 

So, what I'm asking you is what, if any, 
involvement did Nadia Marcenacova have with the 
girls that would arrive and be labeled as 
masseuses behind closed doors with Mr. Epstein? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: He was the second -- the 
first role was Sarah and she was always -- 
Nadia is a very shy person so she will be in 
the background. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Did you ever know of Nadia Marcenacova to 
engage in -- to be in the room with Mr. Epstein 
while any of these young girls were up there? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: Yeah. 

BY MR. EPSTEIN: 

Q. How often do you remember Nadia and Mr. 
Epstein being in the room with any of these young 
girls? 

A. | would say most of the time. 

Q. Nadia would go up there too? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. Did you ever believe that Nadia was

engaging in sex acts with these young girls? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No, | don't know. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. No one ever told you that? 

A. No. 

Q. Well, since you've been keeping up with 
what's been written in the newspapers, at some 
point in time you've read that Nadia Marcenacova 
joined in some of these sex acts with some of 
these girls. Right? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: | believe so. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. I'm not the first person telling you 
that? 

A. No, no, no, | read it in the newspaper. 

MR. CRITTON: He read your press release. 
MR. EDWARDS: Long before | ever had 
anything to do with this case. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Were you surprised when you read that? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 


Page 243 

Q. Were you surprised when the story started 
coming out that these girls that were coming over 
to the house were under the age of 18 and Mr. 
Epstein was engaging in sex acts with them? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. When was the first time that you knew for 
sure 100 percent that -- well, let me say it this 
way. 

When was the first time that you read 
that information? 

A. Underage? 

Q. Yes. 

A. When this scandal broke out when the Palm 
Beach Police Department -- 

Q. Contacted you? 

A. Yeah. 

MR. CRITTON: Why don't you let him 
finish his answer instead of suggesting or 
giving him the answer. 
THE WITNESS: The West Palm Beach Police 
Department got involved. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. Skipping to the second paragraph of 


OMONA UN BWNFE 





Page 244 
page 72, Rodriguez stated the amount of girls that 
came to the house was approximately 15. 

That's the estimate that you gave back -- 

A. All the girls that | saw coming in and 
out. 

Q. Well, when | read this, you can tell me 
what it actually means, when | read this | 
interpreted that as because they were talking 
about masseuses | interpreted that as the number 
of girls of the Palm Beach area that came over and 
you labeled masseuses. Is that correct? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. Could you name -- | mean, | know 
that we've named T. and C., could you name any of 
the other -- 

A. C. comes all the time, you know, | 
remember her. 

Okay. No other names pop out though? 

To be honest with you, no. 

A.? 

Yeah, because | remember because the car. 
All right. It goes on to say, when asked 


to identify these girls, so somebody else asked 


Page 245 
you the same question | just did, Rodriguez stated 
he could not at the moment but knew he wrote their 
names down on a journal he kept during his employ 
with Mr. Epstein. Is that true? 

A. Yes. 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Did you ever find that journal? 

A. Probably has some pages at home. 

Q. Because later on it seems like you met up 
with the police officer and produced a green 
folder that contained documents, but that's not 
the same thing as the journal. Right? 

A. No, this is my writings. 

Q. Okay. So if we want to obtain that 
journal from you what's the best way to go about 
getting it? 

A. | probably have to look in my house. 

Q. Okay. Well, it looks like we're going to 
come back for a second part of this, so by next 
time maybe you could find it. Right? 

A. Okay. 

Q. Allright. Mr. Mermelstein asked you if 
anybody had contacted you about this case that was 
either an -- that was an investigator with Mr.

Epstein. Right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And the first thing that | wrote was that 
two investigators met you for a couple of hours at 
Don Shula's. Is that right? 

A. Yes. 

Q. How did that whole meeting come together, 
did they call you? 

A. Well, they came to my house and then we 
agreed for a more detailed meeting, and halfway 
through -- | was in the area something he said | 
can meet you there, so he suggest Don Shula Hotel. 

Q. How long did you talk with them at your 
house? 

A. Probably an hour or two. 

Q. So there was an hour or two at your 
house? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And then they decided you weren't 
finished talking with them yet and they talked 
with you two more hours at Don Shula's? 

A. Yes. 

Q. So you spent up to four hours with these 
investigators for Mr. Epstein? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 


Page 247 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. And! know that you told us a couple of 
things, they wanted to know what you knew, but did 
they suggest a way for you to testify to help Mr. 
Epstein? 

MR. CRITTON: Form, asked and answered. 
THE WITNESS: The way the meeting went is 
he took notes and asked me questions how do 
you know, he asked me about -- it's like I'm 
going to a job, what do you know about this, 
running this, who is this person, so it was 
like questions and answers, questions and 
answers. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. Okay. 

A. And that was it, you know, but mostly the 
questions from their side. 

Q. Okay. And then the next contact that you 
had was with J ack Goldberger? 

A. Yeah. 

Q. And you called J ack Goldberger -- 

A. Yeah, because the subpoena. 

Q. Okay. Well, the first time you call J ack 
Goldberger had something to do with the FBI. 





Page 248 


A. Yeah, exactly, we talked before, yes. 

Q. So this is before the subpoena -- 

A. Yes, yes. 

Q. And you called him and said the FBI is 
wanting to talk to me, what should | do? 

A. Yeah. He told me, you know, tell them 
the truth. And so actually he didn't call me back 
but he know the FBI sat down with me in the 
morning in Green's Pharmacy in Palm Beach. 

Q. Where? 

A. In Green's Pharmacy, it's in front of the 
church. 

How long did you talk to the FBI? 

From 8 to 12, more or less. 

So another four hour talk? 

More or less, yes. It was the same thing 
as the Palm Beach Police Department but they told 
me this is a new investigation because the same 
questions that Palm Beach Police Department ask me 
they start with the same thing, what was going on, 
this and that, and so -- but in a different -- in 
a different character they ask me the same 
questions but they went on and on and on. 

Q. Okay. When did you have your sit down 


Page 249 

meeting with Mr. Critton? 

In his office. 

When? 

Oh when? Last week. 

Last week? 

Or | believe two weeks ago, something 
like that, before this. 

Q. So you received the subpoena for your 
deposition that was scheduled for last week -- 

A. Exactly. 

Q. -- but you had car problems. And you 
called Jack Goldberger again? 

A. Yeah. And he told me he was out of town, 
and then one guy came to my house -- actually, one 
of the securities from Epstein. 

Q. A security guard for Epstein? 

A. No, security expert. 

Q. So an investigator? 

A. An investigator, sorry. And he said get 
in touch with Mr. Critton. 

Q. Do you remember who that is? 

A. | have his card at home.

A. Yes. 

Q. And how long did you meet with him?

gave me Mr. Critton telephone number, he said 
don't talk to Mr. Goldberger.

Critton? 

A. No. | assume that he was not on the case 
anymore, but | didn't ask questions but -- 

Q. You assumed that who wasn't on the case 
anymore? 

A. Mr. Goldberger, Jack Goldberger. 

Q. Okay. But what I'm asking you, | guess, 
is did this investigator, Mr. Riley, tell you why 
it was important for you to call any attorney 
that's associated with Mr. Epstein, why was that 


Page 251 
important? 

A. He didn't say that. He didn't say that. 

He just said that get in touch and that's it. 
Because | said what am | going to do, because | 
said | thought this was -- you know, but | didn't 
know | was going to be subpoena. And like | said 
in the beginning of this deposition, | don't have 
an attorney so | don't have money, first of all, 

to pay for an attorney. First of all, | don't 

think I'm in trouble, but every time you hear high 
powered lawyers you feel intimidated so | said, 
listen, what am | going to do, and that was my 
basic question. 

Q. Okay. So then you spoke with somebody at 
Mr. Critton's office and arranged to meet with him 
personally? 

A. Yes. | called his secretary and we sit 
down with his assistant, the three of us. 

Q. So it was Mr. Critton, yourself, and 
somebody else? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And you sat down for another two hour 
period of time? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And what did you go over in that meeting? 





Page 252 

A. We discuss -- he asked me a lot of 
questions, obviously he didn't know a lot of 
things about the case, and | told him who | was, 
what | did in the house. 

Q. He told you he didn't know a lot about 
the case? 

A. No, no, no. He asked me questions about 
so | got the feeling that Mr. Critton didn't know 
as much as other lawyers. 

Q. Okay. Did you tell him what you told us 
here today? 

A. No. He asked me tell the truth, you 
know, just go over there, you know, he advise me 
like you're on your own, Alfredo, just tell the 
truth, you know. He didn't give me any advice. 

He paid for my gas. Thank you very much. 
And that's it, you know. 

The main thing | wanted to have a lawyer 
on my side but then | keep going to the first 
instance when my wife told me you don't need a 
lawyer, and |'m here today to say that, |'m here, 
I'm speaking the truth. 

Q. Okay. You mentioned there were five or 
six computers in the house? 

A. Yes. 


Page 253 
Q. And do you know what happened to the 
computers? 
No. 
You don't know where they are?

in the house?

allegation that there were photographs of them 
nude in the house. Do you remember seeing that? 
A. Inthe closet, yeah, in a mosaic. It was 
one frame with probably 15 pictures, small 
pictures.

lawsuits against Mr. Epstein with allegations 
similar to the allegations that C. and T. have 
made, which is that they were underage when Mr.

EXAMINATION 
BY MR. LANGINO: 

Q. My name is Adam Langino from the Law Firm 
of Leopold Kuvin and we represent B.B. in this 
case. 

So you've obviously been here for about 
six hours so | don't have to reinvent the wheel, 
so |'m going to ask you a couple of questions that 
came to mind. 

Any of the individuals that provided 
massage to Mr. Epstein, were they provided any 
drugs? 


Page 261 
No, | don't think so. 
Were they provided any alcohol?

saw a couple of times. 
Q. Do you remember which month that girl 
came to the house?

Q. Do you know why she was at the house? 
A. She asked me when | met her, she said I'm 
looking for a job, | want to help doing the 
laundry, so | related this message to Sarah and 
Sarah told me I'll take care of her from here, but 
| don't know. 
Q. Do you know if she gave a massage to Mr. 
Epstein? 
A. No, | don't know. 
Q. Do you remember any individual who came 
to the house to give Mr. Epstein a massage was

under the influence of alcohol? 

A. No, | don't know. 

Q. When Mr. Epstein's investigators first 
contacted you, did you want to speak with them? 

A. If | wanted to talk to the investigators? 

Q. Did you want to speak with them? 

A. Yes, because | was concerned if | was in 
trouble with Mr. Epstein or | was in trouble with 
anything. 

Q. In December 2005, early J anuary 2006 when 
you cooperated with the police, how come you 
cooperated with the police? 

A. They give me an introduction of what was 
going on, and the investigation, at that time 
nobody knew, the press, nobody, and they told me 
they needed my cooperation and | -- they asked me 
we like to know your honest answers, and that's 
what | did. 

How did you feel about cooperating? 
| feel good. 

You stated -- 

Sorry, go ahead. 

Did you have anything else to add?

some of the oils and creams that were left over 
after the massage. 

A. Yes.

A. And it's a big tube like this, no, | 
don't remember right now.

oils had any kind of a sexual connotation to the 
name or the product? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. LANGINO: 

Q. Do you know if any masseuse that came to 
Epstein's home ever provided massage to someone 
else besides Mr. Epstein? 

A. No, | don't know. 

Q. Before you talked about a massager that 
was always present after a massage and you stated 
that you placed that massager back into inventory. 

A. Yes. 





Page 264 

Q. Where was that inventory? 

A. It was kept in an armoire in the master 
bedroom -- master bath. 

Q. Was that massager that was always found 
after these massages kept in the same armoire with 
the sex toys? 

A. No, it's a different armoire, different 
furniture. 

Q. Were any other massagers kept in that 
armoire? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Can you describe them? 

A. Two, two big ones, the two rubber tips, 
they were kept in the bathroom. 

Q. And where was this armoire in relation to 
the one that held the sex toys? 

A. The one with the sex toys was in his 
bedroom in front of his table, in front of his 
bed, and the other ones were inside the bathroom.

any of these masseuses? 

A. No, | don't know. 

Q. Do you hold any significant feeling 
regarding Mr. Epstein finishing his jail sentence 
now that he's free? 

MR. CRITTON: Form. 

THE WITNESS: If he was sentenced for 
solicitation of prostitution and he did 
leave before that, you know, | think it's 
not -- | don't think he has been doing what 
he was supposed to do, you know, the full 
18 months, and to be monitored after that 
and what have you. But! don't think -- 
answering your question, | don't think it's 
been done justice. 

MR. CRITTON: Let me move to strike as 
irrelevant to anything.

Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully submits this 
Reply in Response to Defendant’s Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Response to Plaintiff's 
Motion to Compel the Production of Documents Subject to Improper Claim of Privilege (D.E. 
46).' For the reasons set forth below, this Court should grant Ms. Giuffre’s Motions to Compel in 
their entirety. 


I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT? 


This Reply references and incorporates Ms. Giuffre’s arguments on Defendant’s improper 
assertion of privilege on Defendant’s privilege log as iterated in Ms. Giuffre’s Motion to Compel 
the Production of Documents Subject to Improper Claim of Privilege (D.E. 33). In order to 
comply with page limit restrictions, this Reply primarily addresses new arguments raised in 
Defendant’s Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Compel the 
Production of Documents Subject to Improper Claim of Privilege (D.E. 46). 

Il. ARGUMENT 

A. Under The Second Circuit’s “Touch Base” Test, New York Law Applies 

This Court need not even reach a choice-of-law analysis for three reasons. First, while 
Defendant claims that English privilege law applies, she does not claim a privilege under English 


law. For every entry on her privilege log, she claims attorney-client privilege, a privilege 


'Ms. Giuffre notes that Defendant’s combined “responses” are over the page limit pursuant to this Court’s 
individual practice rules. 


* Ms. Giuffre views Defendant’s “Supplemental Responses” (D.E. 45 and 46) as impermissible sur-replies. 
Defendant already filed a Response, and her “supplemental” responses were filed after Ms. Giuffre filed 
her Reply to Defendant’s Response. See In re A2P SMS Antitrust Litig., 972 F. Supp. 2d 465, 500 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (striking sur-reply because it does not respond to “new issues which are material to the 
disposition of the question before the [C]ourt,”); Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich Ltd., 982 F. Supp. 2d 260, 
263 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“the Court notes that Plaintiffs’ letter is a sur-reply filed without permission of the 
Court and does not identify new controlling law, and therefore will not be considered.”). 


To the extent that this Court has not yet made a sua sponte ruling to strike them from the docket to 
date, Ms. Giuffre hereby files her reply briefs within the time allotted under the Local Rules.

recognized by New York (and the remainder of United States jurisdictions). She does not claim 
the “legal advice privilege,” the analog to the attorney-client privilege in England. 

Second, English “legal advice privilege” law is substantially similar to that of New York’s 
“attorney-client privilege” law (the privilege claimed in Defendant’s privilege log), making the 
analysis unnecessary. On Time Aviation, Inc. v. Bombardier Capital, Inc., 354 F. App'x 448, 450 
(2d Cir. 2009) (declining to reach a choice of law analysis as the result would the same under the 
various jurisdiction’s law). “The parties appear to agree that the relevant privilege law is that of 
New York, rather than of England . . . the court will follow the parties' decision to apply New 
York law. The English rule, which is apparently similar, appears also to require that legal 
advice be a predominant purpose of the communication (see Waugh v. British Ry. Bd., [1980] 
AC 521 (HLL.).”* Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London, 176 Misc. 2d 
605, 609, 676 N.Y.S.2d 727, 730 (Sup. Ct. 1998) aff'd sub nom. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Certain 
Underwriters at Lloyd's, 263 A.D.2d 367, 692 N.Y.S.2d 384 (1999) (Emphasis added). Therefore, 
because New York’s “attorney-client privilege” is substantially similar to the British “legal advice 
privilege,” this Court need not reach a choice-of-law analysis. 

Third, the facts do not support the application of the choice-of-law test cited by defendant. 
In Astra Aktiebolag v. Andrx Pharm., Inc., the court explained, “[w]here, as here, alleged 
privileged communications took place in a foreign country or involved foreign attorneys or 
proceedings, this court defers to the law of the country that has the ‘predominant’ or “the most 
direct and compelling interest’ in whether those communications should remain confidential, 


unless that foreign law is contrary to the public policy of this forum.” 208 F.R.D. 92, 98 


> Waugh v. British Ry. Bd., [1980] AC 521 (H.L.), attached hereto to the McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, 
states, at p. 521-522, “Held. . . that the due administration of justice strongly required that a document such 
as the internal inquiry report, which was contemporary, contained statements by witnesses on the spot and 
would almost certainly be the best evidence as to the cause of the accident, should be disclosed; that for the 
important public interest to be overridden by a claim of privilege the purpose of submission to the party’s 
legal advisers in anticipation of litigation must be at least the dominant purpose for which it had been 
prepared.” 


(S.D.N.Y. 2002). Here, there are not sufficient facts to trigger the application of this 
“predominance” analysis, but several facts militate against its application. First, the 
communication as at issue did not “take place in a foreign country,” as defendant participated in 
these communications from the United States.* Second, the communications at issue” did not all 
involve a “foreign attorney;” many were just between Defendant and her non-attorney press agent. 
Finally, this analysis does not apply as there are no “foreign proceedings” involved, as discussed 
in greater detail infra. Therefore, the Court need not reach a choice-of-law analysis because New 
York’s attorney-client privilege law and English legal advice privilege law are substantially 
similar, and the facts do not trigger the application of Defendant’s choice-of-law test. 

However, should the Court choose to employ a choice-of-law analysis regarding the 
applicable privilege law, New York law controls. There were no foreign proceedings, the damage 
control on Defendant’s tarnished New York socialite reputation was the predominant purpose of 
the communications involving Gow, and Defendant’s reputation that was harmed, primarily, in 
New York where she resides. Finally, absent any declaration or other evidentiary showings that 


English law applies, this Court should find that New York law applies. 


* Defendant addressed a journalist on a Manhattan street the day after her initial defamatory statement was 
released and she referred reporters to her statement. 


° For example, Defendant claims attorney-client privilege with communications from Ross Gow to 
Defendant. See log entry from January 2, 2015 email on Defendant’s Privilege Log.

B. Under English Law, the Privilege Log is Still Deficient® 


Should the Court determine Defendant has met her burden in showing that English law 
should apply to the determinations of privilege, ’ Ms. Giuffre submits that it must reach the same 
conclusion as under New York law: (1) there is no legal advice privilege (i.e. the English 
equivalent of attorney-client privilege) that attaches to the communications in which an attorney is 
not present, (2) no legal advice privilege attaches to communications with attorneys when made in 
the presence of a third party, such that the communications are not confidential and (3) no 
litigation privilege applies when litigation is not reasonably in prospect or ongoing at the time the 


communications are made. 


1. The English “Legal Advice” Privilege Does Not Apply 


Under English law, a document can be withheld from disclosure on grounds of legal advice 
privilege if it is: (1) a confidential communication; which passes between a client and his/her 


lawyer (including via an agent); and (2) which has come into existence for the purpose of giving 


° This discussion in this brief on the application of English privilege law is based upon the legal opinions of 
attorneys in the London branch of the undersigned’s law firm, as well as English case law, cited through 
and attached as exhibits. 


Under Rule 44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in determining foreign law, “the court may 
consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or 
admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1. Rule 44.1 gives a court “wide 
latitude” to determine foreign law, Rutgerswerke AG & Frendo S.p.A. v. Abex Corp., No. 93 Civ. 
2914(JFK), 2002 WL 1203836, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. June 4, 2002), and the Second Circuit has “urge[d] 
district courts to invoke the flexible provisions of Rule 44.1 to determine issues relating to the law of 
foreign nations,” Curley v. AMR Corp., 153 F.3d 5, 13 (2d Cir.1998). 


“In making rulings regarding foreign law, courts have employed various methods: they have 
considered the plain text of applicable foreign law; made assumptions regarding the interpretation of 
translated foreign law sources; considered expert affidavits submitted by parties; evaluated experts’ 
credibility; assessed experts’ opinions and the basis of such opinions as supported by the foreign country’s 
civil law, cases, treatises, and logic.” In re: Lyondell Chem. Co., 543 B.R. 428, 444 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 
2016). 


Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre respectfully requests that the Court consider the plain text of the attached 
case law should the Court decide to make a ruling based upon English law. 


7 «tT ]he party relying on foreign law has the burden of showing such law bars production of documents.” 


Tansey v. Cochlear Ltd., No. 13-CV-4628 SJF SIL, 2014 WL 4676588, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 18, 2014) 
(Internal quotation and citation omitted). 


or receiving legal advice about what should prudently and sensibly be done in the relevant legal 
context. Where there is no attorney involved in the communication (such as those 
communications between Defendant and other non-attorneys), there can be no “legal advice” 
privilege under English Law. 
a. Confidentiality Under English Law 

Under English law, the fact that a third party is present at the time legal advice is 
sought/obtained (as with communications Defendant made with attorneys with a third party 
involved) does not necessarily prevent the communication from being confidential. Ifa 
communication is provided to a third party on express terms that it is to remain confidential and 
was not generally available outside the limited group of recipients, privilege will not necessarily 
be lost to the outside world (USP Strategies v London General Holdings Ltd, [2004] EWHC 373 
(Ch)).* On that basis, Defendant must bear the burden of proving that the documents are 
privileged.’ Defendant has not submitted any evidence, such as a Non-Disclosure Agreement, that 
expressly places Ross Gow under an obligation of confidence in respect to information received 
by him relating to legal advice/litigation. In absence of any express obligation of confidentiality, 
Ms. Giuffre submits that privilege does not attach to communications involving Ross Gow and the

* USP Strategies v London General Holdings Ltd, [2004] EWHC 373 (Ch), attached hereto to the 
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2, states, “[i]f A shows a privileged document to his six best friends, he will not 
be able to assert privilege if one of the friends sues him because the document is not confidential as 
between him and the friend. But the fact six other people have seen it does not prevent him claiming 
privilege as against the rest of the world.” I think that it follows from that that A would be able to restrain 
each of the friends from disclosing to the outside world what they were told on the basis that it remained 
privileged. The friends could not give secondary evidence of the privileged material — it would be 
“evidence of [privileged] communications”, or their evidence would be “evidencing such communications” 
within the formulation in Three Rivers. By the same token, if a client summarizes or extracts advice in a 
letter to a third party, that written communication is capable of retaining or attracting the privilege which 
attached to the original advice, subject to waiver. It, too, is something which evidences a privileged 
communication.”

claiming privilege”. West London Pipeline and Storage v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 258, at para. 50,

b. Communication Via An Agent Under English Law 


Under English Law, communications between client and lawyer through an agent will be 
protected by legal advice privilege, but this will only apply in situations where the agent functions 
as no more than a mere conduit (e.g. a translator). Third parties engaged to provide their own 
intellectual input (e.g. accountants) will not be regarded as agents for the purposes of legal advice 
privilege. Whether Ross Gow functioned as a true agent for the purposes of privilege must be 
assessed by reference to the type of information that was being provided to the attorney. USP

Cc. Under English Law, The Communication Must Be For The Purpose 
Of Giving Or Receiving Legal Advice 





Ross Gow’s website notes that he is a “Reputation Manager” — not a lawyer. Maxwell 
states that Mr. Gow provided information to Mr. Barden “regarding press inquiries so as to further 
Mr. Barden’s ability to give appropriate legal advice to Ms. Maxwell regarding potential 
defamation litigation in the United Kingdom” (D.E. 46 at 9). Even if legal advice were obtained 
from Mr. Barden as a result of the information provided by Mr. Gow, it is not clear that the 
information provided by Ross Gow was itself confidential, particularly if it related to information 
that is already in the press/public domain. Maxwell should be put to prove that the written 


communications were confidential, came into existence specifically for the purpose of giving or

receiving legal advice and were not simply for damage control purposes to her socialite reputation 
relating to her intimate involvement with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

C. Under New York Law, The Privilege Log Is Deficient 

Defendant submitted a 16-entry, facially deficient log under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(b)(5) and Local Rule 26.2(a)(2)(B) and the governing case law. First, Defendant 
attempts to wrongfully claim that the attorney-client privilege shields documents from production 
as to her communications with non-attorneys. Second, Defendant improperly claims a “common 
interest” privilege applies to her communications with convicted sex offender — and non-attorney - 
- Jeffrey Epstein, for which no attorney-client privilege applies, thus, precluding the application of 
the “common interest” privilege. This is simply wrong. “The common interest rule is an extension 
of the attorney-client privilege and not an independent basis for privilege.” Pem-Am., Inc. v. 
Sunham Home Fashions, LLC, No. 03 CIV. 1377JFKRLE, 2007 WL 3226156, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 31, 2007). “In order for a communication to be privileged within the common interest rule, it 
... must still meet the requirements of a privileged attorney-client communication.” Jd. 
(Emphasis added). See Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290 F.R.D. 421, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) 
(“communications are protected where there is a disclosure by A to the attorney representing B 
and vice-versa’). 

Third, Defendant improperly claims the attorney-client privilege when the communications 
involved the presence of a third party not involved in providing legal services, such as Ross Gow 


or Mark Cohen. See Egiazaryan, 290 F.R.D. at 431.'' Fourth, the descriptions of the 


'' Defendant attempts to base her argument on Jn re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated March 24, 2003, 265 F. 
Supp. 2d 321, 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2003), but that the facts are so different between that case and the instant case 
that the comparison is inapt. Instead, for this case, Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290 F.R.D. 421 (S.D.N.Y. 
2013) and NXIVM Corp. v. O’Hara, 241 F.R.D. 109, 141 (N.D.N.Y. 2007) should control. See also Nance 
v. Thompson Med. Co., 173 F.R.D. 178, 182-83 (E.D. Tex. 1997). The bulk of the relevant authority, in 
circumstances similar to the case at hand, does not extend attorney-client privilege to communications with 
public relations firms - even if attorneys are present for the communications - and for good reason. Public 
relations firms are not in the business of giving legal advice; they exist to manage their client’s public

communications in the log are inadequate. Every single communication on the log, even those not 
involving any attorneys, is described as “Communication re: legal advice.” 

These sparse and unvaried descriptions simply do not comply with Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 26(b)(5) and Local Rule 26.2(a)(2)(B), and are not sufficient to support the privilege 
claims asserted therein. 

Accordingly, this Court should find that Defendant has waived her privilege claim for 
every entry which describes the subject matter as “Communication re: legal advice,” or at the very 
least, require Defendant to submit the documents in question for in camera review to determine 
whether they are actually subject to any privilege claim. In addition, the Court should direct the 
production of documents on the privilege log that involve communications between the two non- 
lawyers. - 


CONCLUSION 


For the foregoing reasons this Court should order Defendant to produce the documents 
listed in her privilege log, or at the very least, conduct an in camera inspection to determine 


whether or not these documents are privileged under applicable law. 


reputations. And management of her public reputation is why Defendant retains Gow, and has for many 
years. (D.E. 56 at 9). 

'? Defendant inexplicably states that Ms. Giuffre has somehow waived her argument that she is entitled to 
communications from Gow subsequent to the issuance of the press release. In the section on 
communications with Gow, Ms. Giuffre stated: Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre is entitled to communications 
relating to Mr. Gow - particularly the January 2, 2015 email - for the entire Relevant Period. (D.E. 35 at p. 
19, emphasis added). The Relevant Period is defined as 1999 through the present. Therefore, there is no 
waiver.

for which prépared 


The plaintiff’s husband was employed by the defendant 
railways board. In a collision between locomotives, he 
received injuries from which he died. The practice of the 

D board when an accident occurred was that on the day of the 
accident a brief report was made to the railway inspectorate, 
soon afterwards a joint internal report (“the joint inquiry 
report”) was prepared incorporating statements of witnesses, 
which was also sent to the inspectorate, and in due course a 
report was made by the inspectorate for the Department of the 
Environment. The heading of the joint inquiry report stated 
that it had finally to be sent to the board’s solicitor for the 

E purpose of enabling him to advise the board. The plaintiff 
brought an action against the board under the Fatal Acci- 
dents Acts, alleging that the collision had been caused by their 
negligence, and sought discovery of, inter alia, the joint inquiry 
report. The board, who denied negligence and alleged that 
the collision had been caused or contributed to by the 
deceased’s own negligence, refused to disclose the report on 
the ground, as stated in an affidavit sworn on their behalf, 

F that one of the principal purposes of preparing it had been 
so that it could be passed to their chief solicitor to enable 
him to advise the board on its legal liability and, if necessary, 
conduct their defence to the proceedings, and that it was 
accordingly the subject of legal professional privilege. On 
an interlocutory application by the plaintiff for discovery of 
the report, the master ordered discovery, but an appeal by the 

G board from his order was allowed by Donaldson J., and the 
Court of Appeal by a majority (Eveleigh L.J. and Sir David 
Cairns, Lord Denning M.R. dissenting) dismissed an appeal 
by the plaintiff from Donaldson J.’s order. 

On appeal by the plaintiff: — 

Held, allowing the appeal, that the due administration of 
justice strongly required that a document such as the internal 
inquiry report, which was contemporary, contained statements 

H by witnesses on the spot and would almost certainly be the 
best evidence as to the cause of the accident, should be dis- 
closed; that for that important public interest to be overridden 
by a claim of privilege the purpose of submission to the party’s 
legal advisers in anticipation of litigation must be at least the

INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL from the Court of Appeal. 

By an action. against the- respondent defendants, the British Railways 
Board, the appellant plaintiff, Alice Simpson Waugh (widow of John 
Wallace Waugh, deceased), claimed damages against the board in respect 
of the death of the deceased under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents 

p Acts 1846-1959, alleging that a collision between two of the board’s, 
locomotives that had resulted in the death of the deceased, who had been 
employed by the board, had been caused by the negligence of the board, 
their servants or their agents. By their defence, the board denied negli-. 
gence, and alleged that the collision had been caused or contributed to by 
the deceased’s own negligence. The plaintiff sought discovery of an internal 
inquiry report made by two. officers of the board two days after the 

E accident, but the board refused discovery on.the ground of legal pro- 
fessional privilege. On an interlocutory application by the plaintiff, Master 
Bickford Smith, on January 26, 1978, ordered disclosure of the report, but 
Donaldson J., on May 8, 1978, allowed an appeal by the board from that 
order. The Court of Appeal, on July 28, 1978, by a majority (Eveleigh L.J. 
and Sir David Cairns, Lord Denning M.R. dissenting) dismissed an appeal 

p by the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed by leave of the Court of Appeal. 

The facts are set out in their Lordships’ opinions. 


Peter Weitzman Q.C. and Michael Brent for the plaintiff. Where a 
report is brought into existence for several reasons or purposes only one 
of which is to obtain professional legal advice in litigation that is pending 
or anticipated, is it protected by legal professional privilege from dis- 

G covery? What is the test? There are a number of possible answers. 

(1) It is enough to secure privilege if the intention to obtain legal advice is 

a purpose, inter alia. (2) The intention to obtain legal advice must be at 

least a substantial purpose. (3) The purpose for which the document is 

brought into existence must be wholly or mainly that of obtaining profes- 

sional legal advice, or it must have been “the primary,” “ the substan- 

H five,” or “the dominant,’’ purpose (these different phrases have all been 

used in the cases). (4) It must be the sole purpose. The plaintiff says 
that the answer is (4), alternatively, possibly, (3). 

As to the authorities, the following preliminary observations may be 


oe ere Document 57-1 Filed 03/14/16 Page 5 of 26 


Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(E.) ) [1980] 


made. At one time, the practice differed as between equity and com- 
mon law. (2) R.S.C., Ord. 24, r. 5, first came into existence in 1894 as 
R.S.C., Ord. 31, r. 19A. It was not until then that there was power in 
the court to inspect the documents in respect of which privilege was 
claimed. The authorities fall into three groups: (i) pre-1913; (ii) Birming- 
ham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and North Western 
Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 and Ogden v. London Electric Railway 
Co. (1939) 49 T.L.R. 542; (iii) the cases after that, which do not add B 
much. Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. v. Quick (1878) 3 Q.B.D. 315 

is strong authority for the “sole purpose” test, and Collins v. London 
General Omnibus Co. (1893) 68 L.T. 831 is also clear authority that at 
that stage the test was the “sole purpose” test. [Reference was made 

to Woolley v. North London Railway Co. (1869) L.R. 4 C.P. 602; 
Anderson v. Bank of British Columbia (1876) 2 Ch.D. 644; London and 
Tilbury Railway Co. v. Kirk and Randall (1884) 28 S.J. 688; Cook v. Cc 
North Metropolitan Tramway Co. (1889) 54 J.P. 263; and the Sixteenth 
Report of the Law Reform Committee (Privilege in Civil Proceedings) 
(1967) (Cmnd. 3472), pp. 8 (para. 17), 13.] 

Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and 
North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 turns, to begin with, on 
the form of words used in the affidavit (Eveleigh L.J. in the present case D 
said that the judgment of Buckley L.J. there could be read in that way). 
It was not, therefore, intended to deal with the proper principles or test to 
be applied. Alternatively, Buckley and Hamilton L.JJ. were by implica- 
tion referring to the “‘ dominant purpose ”’ test. The plaintiff relies on the 
passage at p. 860: ‘‘ The only authority . . .” Hamilton L.J. is at least 
saying that there is no authority for the view that the purpose does not 
at least have to be the primary or substantial purpose, and the judgment 
of Buckley L.J., even taken on its own, does not go to the extent of 
contradicting that of Hamilton L.J.: see at p. 856: “It is not I think 
necessary . . .” (In Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. v. Quick, 3 
Q.B.D. 315, the word “‘ merely ” was used a number of times by Brett L.J.) 
The argument in the Birmingham case was directed largely to the form 
of the affidavit. There is no suggestion in the report that there was any F 
other purpose. The judgment of Buckley L.J. relates primarily to the 
wording of the affidavit rather than to the substance of it. [Reference 
was made to Adam Steamship Co. Ltd. v. London Assurance Corpora- 
tion [1914] 3 K.B. 1256 and Ankin v. London and North Eastern Rail- 
way Co. [1931] 1 K.B. 527.] 

Ogden v. London Electric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542, is moving to 
the position that, as a matter of substance, it is enough that one, substan- G 
tial, purpose for bringing the document into existence is that it shall be 
available for legal advice. This is inconsistent with the judgments in 
Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. v. Quick, 3 Q.B.D. 315. Scrutton L.J. 
misinterpreted that case, and wrongly extended what the Birmingham case 
decided. Ogden was wrongly decided, if it is authority that a substantial 
purpose is sufficient. Westminster Airways Ltd. v. Kuwait Oil Co. Ltd: yy 
(1951] 1 K.B. 134 is against the plaintiff: it shows that, since Ogden, the 
courts have been following Ogden and taking the view that a substantial 
purpose is enough. There is a reference to ‘‘ other purposes” at p. 143.

AC. Waugh v. British Railways Board (HLL.(E.) ) 


[Reference was made to Seabrook v. British Transport Commission [1959] 
1 W.L.R. 509; Longthorn v. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 
W.L.R. 530 and Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd. v. Customs 
and Excise Commissioners (No. 2) [1974] A.C. 405.] 

The privilege should only be accorded where it is necessary in order 
to achieve the purpose for which it is designed. Where the party would 
have brought the document into existence apart from the seeking of legal 
B advice, there is no need for the privilege. Before 1894, when only the 
affidavit was produced, the inability of the court to inspect the actual 
documents could lead to abuse or mistake. Birmingham and Midland 
Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and North Western Railway Co. 
[1913] 3 K.B. 850 was the first case where the court examined what the 
affidavit had to say and also looked at the documents. Thus, the language 
of the affidavit was no longer vital. There were now two questions: 
should the court inspect the documents, and was the form of words 
conclusive? Because the court could inspect the documents, the form of 
words was no longer conclusive. [Reference was made to Grant v. 
Downs (1976) 135 C.L.R. 674; Wigmore’s Law of Evidence (1905), vol. iv, 
paras. 2317-2319 and R.S.C., Ord. 38, r. 29.] 

The plaintiff’s submissions, in summary, are as follows. 1. Ogden v. 
Dp London Electric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542, was wrongly decided. One 
can go back to the situation before Birmingham and Midland Motor 
Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 
K.B. 850, where, as was said in Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. v. 
Quick, 3 Q.B.D. 315, the sole purpose test was the appropriate test. 
What is said by Lord Cross of Chelsea in Alfred Crompton Amusement 
Machines Ltd. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners (No. 2) [1974] 
A.C. 405, with the concurrence of the others of their Lordships, is that 
the matter is now open for the House to decide what is the appropriate 
test to be applied—that is, presumably, that which is most desirable in 
the interests of justice. If privilege is to be accorded to a document, it 
is only to be accorded where that is necessary for the basic rationale 
of the rule, as expressed, inter alia, by Sir George Jessel M.R. in 
F Anderson v. Bank of British Columbia (1876) 2 Ch.D. 644, 648-649. 
If a document comes into existence in circumstances such that it 
cannot be shown that it would not have come into existence but for 
the purposes of litigation, then in truth the privilege does not serve 
the purpose that is the basis of the rule, but merely provides an adventi- 
tious advantage. This is particularly the case with large corporate 
employers who are obliged to collect knowledge, as in this case. These 
points were made in Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, on which 
the plaintiff very much relies. The problem posed can best be met by 
applying the sole purpose test; alternatively, the dominant purpose test, 
on the basis that the dominant purpose is the one that, if it had not 
existed, would mean that the document would not have come into exist- 
ence. Here, the litigation purpose is at the highest one of two equal 
H_ purposes.

port or Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. 

One of the objects of privilege is to prevent one party Geta seeing in 
detail what the other party’s case is. It is very difficult to define “‘ sub- 
stantial.” As to the tests, (1) once duality has been raised, there is no 
English case that has approved the sole purpose test. The only case, 
Telied on by the plaintiff, is Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674. (2) the 
dominant purpose test has not been used by any judge except Barwick 
C.J. in Grant v. Downs. How does one assess dominance? Dominance 
in whose eyes? At what particular time? 

[Lorp EpMuND-Davigs. In a civilised society, would not the domin- 
ant purpose be to find out what happened, so as to prevent it from 
happening again? ] 

In this case, there was no dominant purpose. The second report, the C 
joint inquiry report of May 6, 1976, was really the collection of evidence. 
One difficulty of this approach is to distinguish between one aspect and 
another: which is the important one? The answer here should therefore 
be that'the real test here can be described as: a ‘‘ substantial purpose ”’— 

a substantial purpose ’’—test, or an “‘ appreciable purpose” test. ‘‘ An 
appreciable ” means. that it is something of consequence. The board does yy 
not accept the substantial purpose test because there was not a substantial 
purpose here. If there had been one, they would not go as far as to 
accept that. test. They would accept that it is a question of ‘* dominant 
in whosé eyes? ’” Even there, there is difficulty, because one might have, 
for example, two members of a family charged with making a report about 
an accident that had happened to them: one might regard the dominant 
purpose of the report: as liability, the other safety. ‘‘.4 dominant pur- E 
pose ” means a substantial purpose without the need to inquire whether it 
was the dominant purpose. -There are two basic criteria: (1) that the test 
should be fair to both parties to the litigation; (2) that it should be simple 
to understand and easy to apply in practice. Support for the “a substan- 
tial purpose” test is found in the judgment of Diplock J. in Longthorn 
v. British Transport Commission {1959] 1 W.L.R. 530, 534; see also Konia F 
v. Morley [1976] 1 N.Z.L.R. 455 and the test that Eveleigh L.J. applied 
in the present case. Provided that the board establish a substantial purpose, 
they concede that there may be cases—not this one—where there may be 
a more important function. Thus, the substantial, appreciable purpose 
test ought to be applied. It represents the law and practice of at least 
‘the last 60 years. It is fair to both parties, in the sense that the privilege 
attaching to the document supports the case of the board in this instance. G 
It has that advantage, but it precludes the plaintiff, on general grounds, 
from having access to information to. which otherwise she would be 
entitled. 

[Lorp SIMON OF GLAISDALE. There are two conflicting principles— 
‘curiously, both advanced to further the administration of justice. They 
point in different directions. One usually tries to resolve such a conflict yy 
by finding a middle line. ] = 
+ That is the difficulty here: to find a workable middle line. This 
advances the board’s case for ‘substantial ”’ or “ appreciable.”

[Lorp.RUSSELL OF KILLOWEN. What about the preliminary au 
report?: There must also.have been a report -to the police? ] 

The accident report was not disclosed. The coroner’s notes were dis. 

closed. The ‘board could hold ‘two. inquiries, -one as to liability and’one 
as to safety. It could not then be said that the first would be ciscloss O's 
The second would’be. * 
. The plaintiff says that Southwark: ine Vauxhall Water Co. Vv. Quick; 
B 3 QB.D: 315, is ‘strong authority for the sole purpose test. There, the 
court was not concerned with any duality of purpose, and they were not 
directing their mind to that-point. “Secondly, ‘the plaintiff says that 
Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co.’ Ltd. v. London and 
North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 turned mainly on the 
form of ‘words used in thé affidavit and was not, therefore, intended to 
deal with the proper principles and the test to be applied; alternatively; 
she suggests that Buckley and Hamilton L.JJ. were by implication referring 
to the dominant purpose test: That case has been considered ever since 
it was decided as settling matters of principle; and it is not correct to say 
that within the language used the court were favouring the dominant 
purpose test. There is no distinction between ‘‘ primary” and ‘ domins 
ant ”” ; that is why one should prefer the substantial purpose test. 

D - The plaintiff said that Ogden v. London Electric Railway Co., 49 
T.L.R. 542, was wrongly decided: Scrutton L.J. misinterpreted the 
Southwark and Vauxhall case and extended what had. been decided in the 
Birmingham case. Ogden, like the Birmingham case, has been regarded 
as settling matters of principle now for’a great number of years; Scrutton 
LJ. took a correct view of the Southwark and Vauxhall case and correctly 
interpreted and applied the Birmingham case. The present state of the 

E law, based principally on the Birmingham case, the Ogden case and other 
cases referred to in Seabrook. v. British Transport Commission [1959]. 
1 W.L:R. 509, may be summarised as follows. (1) All communications. 
between a client or his legal adviser and‘ third parties are prima facie 
privileged if one of the purposes for which they are made is the purpose 
of pending or contemplated litigation. (2) This purpose need not be the 

fF “dominant” purpose for the document’s existence, but it must be a 
“substantial ’ or ‘‘ appreciable’”’ purpose. (3) Whether or not the pur- 
pose is sufficiently substantial to attract the cloak of privilege will be a 
question of fact and degree in évery case. There is no magic in any 
particular form of words, and (for example) it is not necessary that the 
affidavit should state that information was obtained “ solely ” or ‘“‘ merely ” 
or “ primarily ”’ for the legal adviser. (4) Such a communication remains. 

G privileged notwithstanding the fact that it is brought into existence as a 

matter of routine, or in accordance with standing instructions, and not- 

withstanding the fact that it may pass through various hands before 
coming finally to the legal adviser. 

If the test is dominant purpose, it is possible to argue that the domiinaiit 
purpose of the joint inquiry report was an inquiry into liability. The 
H. “ label“ on the affidavit of the assistant to the general manager of the 
board’s Eastern Region in support of the board’s claim of privilege and 
on the joint inquiry report cannot be more than an indication of its pur> 
pose. Paragraph 2 of the board’s list of documents, stating that they have:

in their possession, custody or power the documents “relating to the A

standard form. 

Marr-Johnson following on the Commonwealth authorities. As to 
Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, the House should have in mind the 
principle set out by the majority there. Using shorthand, they applied the 
sole purpose test. The judgment of the majority is based on a fallacy, 
based on a misunderstanding of Anderson v. Bank of British Columbia B 
(1876) 2 Ch.D. 644: see at pp. 687-689. It can be reduced to four pro- 
positions. (1) An ordinary individual can always be compelled to dis- 
close his own knowledge of relevant facts. (2) A corporation generally 
has to acquire knowledge of relevant facts through the written communi- 
cations of its agents. (3) It would be extraordinary if a corporation could 
claim the benefit of a privilege that was not available to an ordinary 
individual. (4) The majority conclude that, if the dual purpose claim 
is allowed the effect would be precisely that. The board agrees with 
(3), but (4) does not follow from (1) and (2). (1) is correct, but ‘‘ relevant 
facts”? means the basic facts of the transaction, the res gestae, one 
might almost say: the written documents in an accident case—typically, 
the entry in the accident book in a factory case—or, in a commercial 
case, the bank account in question. Anderson v. Bank of British D 
Columbia is probably right if one reads it from end to end. The facts 
were wholly different from those in Grant v. Downs. That is plain, 
especially from the judgment of Mellish L.J., at p. 658: “*. . . as to the 
question that we have to decide in this case. . .” 

It is well-established that a client is entitled to act on behalf of his 
legal adviser in obtaining information from third parties. A corporation 
is in no different position from an individual. That point was made 
clearly by Cotton L.J. in Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. v. Quick, 
3 Q.B.D. 315, 321. There is no difference at all that the board is aware 
of. It is plain from all the judgments in Anderson v. Bank of British 
Columbia, 2 Ch.D. 644, particularly that of Mellish L.J., that all the docu- 
ments there would legitimately have been the subject of discovery if the 
bank had been in England: they were, in truth, bankers’ records. F 

The board is not aware of any case other than Grant v. Downs, 135 
C.L.R. 674, where the sole purpose test has been applied. It is not right 
to draw the line at that particular point. If one is to draw a line at 
all, one should draw it where it is capable of being applied easily in 
practice (it is not only High Court judges who have to apply it). 
Apart from Australia, the Commonwealth authorities all apply the sub- 
stantial purpose test, which does work adequately in practice. One G 
might have two different safety officers, one concerned with safety, one 
with liability. Or one might have a document 90 per cent. of which was 
concerned with safety, 10 per cent. with liability. These Commonwealth 
cases follow the practice in England and Wales, and in two of them where 
the substantial purpose test was applied the claim to privilege failed:

[1974] A.C. 405 was considered in Reg. in Right of Canada v. Hawker 
Siddeley Canada Ltd. (1976) 73 D.L.R. (3d) 453. [Reference was made 
to Konia v. Morley [1976] 1 N.Z.L.R. 455.] 

Weitzman Q.C. in reply. One should not go through this report line 
by line, but should look at what the person says who inspired it. There 
is confusion in the board’s argument between the function of pleadings on 
the one hand: and particulars on the other. One should distinguish 
B between the purpose for which the report was made and the use even- 

tually made of its contents. As to the proposition that the test should be 

simple to understand and easy to apply, that is the whole question here. 

It is very difficult to say exactly where such a test as “‘a@ substantial 

purpose ” draws the line. It seems as though the Law Reform Committee 

in its Sixteenth Report (Privilege in Civil Proceedings) (1967) (Cmnd. 

3472) were recommending the dominant purpose test: see at p. 8, para. 
C47: * wholly or mainly.” 

Even if the board’s historical summation of the authorities be right, 
the House in Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd. v. Customs 
and Excise Commissioners (No. 2) [1974] A.C. 405 regarded the matter 
as open for reconsideration. 

It is quite impossible that the board should succeed on the dominant 
D purpose test, because their affidavit falls far short of it. That was 

recognised by Eveleigh L.J. 

As to the Commonwealth authorities, see Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 

674: the Commonwealth cases more or less follow what was said in 

Seabrook v. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 W.L.R. 509 and 

Longthorn v. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 W.L.R. 530. 

E Fairness and good sense suggest that the privilege should be limited to 
those cases where it is essential that it should be granted. Where a docu- 
ment would have been produced anyway, whether there was to be litigation 
or not, that suggests that the privilege is not necessary. 


Their Lordships took time for consideration. 


_ July 12. Lorp WixsBerrorce. My Lords, the appellant’s husband was 
an employee of the British Railways Board. A locomotive which he was 
driving collided with another so that he was crushed against a tank wagon. 
He received injuries from which he died. The present action is brought 
under the Fatal Accidents Acts 1846-1959 and this appeal arises out of an 
interlocutory application for discovery by the board of a report called the 
G “joint inquiry report,” made by two officers of the board two days after 
the accident. This was resisted by the board on the ground of legal pro- 
fessional privilege. The Court of Appeal, Eveleigh L.J. and Sir David 
Cairns, Lord Denning M.R. dissenting, refused the application. 

When an accident occurs on the board’s railways, there are three reports 
which are made. 1. On the day of the accident a brief report of the 
H_ accident is made to the Railway Inspectorate. 2. Soon afterwards a joint 
internal report is prepared incorporating statements of witnesses. This too 
is sent to the Railway Inspectorate. Preparation of this report, it appears, 
is a matter of practice: it is not required by statute or statutory regula-

tion.. 3. In due course.a report is made by the Railway Inspectorate for 
the Department of the Environment. 

The document now in question is that numbered 2. The circumstances 
in which it came to be prepared, and the basis for the claim of privilege, 
were stated in an affidavit sworn on behalf of the board by Mr. G. T. 
Hastings, assistant to the general manager of the Eastern Region. I find 
it necessary to quoté the significant passages in this affidavit. 


“3. The general manager of the Eastern Region is required (as are the 
general managers of the other railways regions) to submit returns to the 
Department of [the] Environment in respect of accidents occurring on 
or about any railway ... 6. It has long been the practice of the board 
and its predecessors to require that returns and reports on all accidents 
occurring on the railway and joint internal departmental inquiries 
into the causes of the said accident be made by the local officers of C 
the board who would forward them to their superiors in order to 
assist in establishing the causes of such accidents. 7. Such reports 
and the statements of ‘witnesses to such accidents are made for the 
purposes mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 6 of this affidavit and equally 
for the purpose of being submitted to the board’s solicitor as material 
upon, which he can ‘advise the board upon its legal liability and for D 
the purpose of conducting on behalf of the board any proceedings 
_ arising out of such accidents . ... 9. It is commonly anticipated by the 
‘ board that: (a) where an employee of the board suffers personal injury 
‘or death at. work or (b) where a passenger suffers loss [or] personal 
injury: or death while on or about the railway a claim for damages 
will be made against the board and proceedings will ensue if liability 
is repudiated. The present action is brought as the result of a fatal E 
accident suffered at. work by the late husband of the plaintiff and 
’ it was anticipated from the very outset that a claim for damages would 
almost certainly ensue.; 10. The documents in this action namely the 
reports made by the board’s officers and servants and the report 
referred to in correspondence as: the internal inquiry report. for 
which the defendants have claimed privilege in part 2 of the first 
schedule of. their -list of documents dated November 11, 1977, came 
into existence. by reason of the fact that the appropriate officer, in 
_ this. case the divisional manager at Newcastle, in accordance with long 
. Standing practice was required to and did so call for such reports and 
statements. One of the principal purposes for so doing was so that 
they could be passed to the board’s chief solicitor to enable him to 
advise the board on its legal liability and if necessary conduct its G 
defence to these proceedings. 11. The internal inquiry report in fact 
states on the face of it that it has finally tobe sent to the solicitor for 
the purpose of enabling him to advise the board.” 


This last paragraph refers to ‘the’ ‘wording which appears at the head of the 

report: ' — ‘ 

“For the information of the board's eilicice: This foi is to be 
“used: by every ‘person reporting an occurrence when litigation by or 

-. ‘against ‘the B.R.B.:is anticipated. -It is to be:-provided by: the person

A! ‘making it to his immediate superior officer and has finally to be sent 
to the solicitor for the purpose of enabling him to advise.the B.R.B. 
in regard thereto.” . 


Whatever this heading may say, the affidavit makes it clear that the 

report was prepared for a dual purpose: for what may be called railway 

operation and safety purposes and for the purpose of obtaining legal 

B advice in anticipation of litigation, the first being more immediate than 

the second, but both being described as of equal rank or weight. So 

the question arises whether this is enough to support a claim of privilege, 

or whether, in order to do so, the second purpose must be the sole purpose, 

or the dominant or main purpose. If either of the latter is correct, the 
claim of privilege in this case must fail. 

My Lords, before I consider the authorities, I think it desirable to 

C attempt to discern the reason why what is (inaccurately) called legal pro- 

fessional privilege exists. It is sometimes ascribed to the exigencies of the 

adversary system of litigation under which.a litigant is entitled within limits 

to refuse to disclose the nature of his case until the trial. Thus one side 

may not ask to see the proofs of the other side’s witnesses:or the 

opponent’s brief or even know what witnesses will be called: he must 

D wait until the card is played and cannot try to see it in the hand. This 

argument cannot be denied some validity even where the defendant is a 

public corporation whose duty it is, so it might be thought, while taking 

all proper steps to protect its revenues, to place all the facts before the 

public and to pay proper compensation to those it has injured. A more 

powerful argument to my mind is that everything should be done in order 

to encourage anyone who knows the facts to state them fully and candidly 

E -—as Sir George Jessel M.R. said, to bare his breast to his lawyer: Anderson 

y. Bank of British Columbia (1876) 2 Ch.D. 644, 699. -This he nny not do 

unless he knows that his communication is privileged. _ od 

But the preparation of a case for litigation is not the. -only interest 

which call for candour. In accident cases ‘ . the safety of the public 

may well. depend on the candour and completeness ‘of. reports. made by 

F subordinates whose duty it is to draw attention to defects”: Conway v. 

Rimmer [1968] A.C. 910, per Lord Reid, at p. 941. This however does 

not by itself justify a claim to privilege since, as Lord Reid continues: . 


. no one has ever suggested that public safety has been endangered 

, by the candour or completeness of such reports having been ‘inhibited 

by the fact that they may have to be produced if the interests of the 

G K .due administration of justice should ever Tequire production at any 
time.” Ls 

So one may deduce from this the ‘iindinis shat while privilese may 

be required in order to induce candour in statements made for the purposes 

of litigation it is not required in relation to statements whose ” purpose is 

different—for example to enable a railway to operate safety. : 

H __ It is clear that the due administration of justice strongly requires dis. 

closure and production of this report: it was contemporary; it contained 

statements by witnesses on the spot; it would be not merely. relevant 

evidence, but’ almost certainly the best ‘evidence as to the cause of the 


Case,4,15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-1 Filed 03/14/16 Page 13 of 26

accident. If one accepts that this important public interest can be over- 
ridden in order that the defendant may properly prepare his case, how 
close must the connection be between the preparation of the document 
and the anticipation of litigation? On principle I would think that the 
purpose of preparing for litigation ought to be either the sole purpose 
or at least the dominant purpose of it: to carry the protection further into 
cases where that purpose was secondary or equal with another purpose 
would seem to be excessive, and unnecessary in the interest of encouraging B 
truthful revelation. At the lowest such desirability of protection as might 
exist in such cases is not strong enough to outweigh the need for all rele- 
vant documents to be made available. 

There are numerous cases in which this kind of privilege has been con- 
sidered. A very useful review of them is to be found in the judgment 
of Havers J. in Seabrook v. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 
W.L.R. 509 which I shall not repeat. It is not easy to extract a coherent 
principle from them. The two dominant authorities at the present time 
are Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and 
North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 and Ogden v. London 
Electric Railway Co. (1933) 49 T.L.R. 542, both decisions of the Court 
of Appeal. These cases were taken by the majority of the Court of 
Appeal in the present case to require the granting of privilege in cases D 
where one purpose of preparing the document(s) in question was to enable 
the defendants’ case to be prepared whether or not they were to be 
used for another substantial purpose. Whether in fact they compel such a 
conclusion may be doubtful—in particular I do not understand the 
Birmingham case to be one of dual purposes at all: but it is enough that 
they have been taken so to require. What is clear is that, though loyally 
followed, they’ do not now enjoy rational acceptance: in Longthorn Vv. 
British Transport Commission [1959] 1 W.L.R. 530 the manner in which 
Diplock J. managed to escape from them, and the tenor of his judgment, 
shows him to have been unenthusiastic as to their merits. And in Alfred 
Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd. v. Customs and Excise Com- 
missioners (No. 2) [1974] A.C. 405 Lord Cross of Chelsea, at p. 432, 
pointedly left their correctness open, while Lord Kilbrandon stated, at fF 
p. 435, that he found the judgment of Scrutton L.J. in Ogden v. London 
Eleétric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542, 543-544, “hard to accept.” Only 
Viscount Dilhorne (dissenting) felt able to follow them in holding it to be 
enough ‘if -one- purpose was the use by solicitors when litigation was 
anticipated. 

The whole question came to be considered by the High Court of 
Australia in 1976: Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674. This case involved @ 
reports which had “as one of the material purposes for their preparation ” 
submission to legal advisers in the event of litigation. It was held that 
privilege could not be claimed. In the joint judgment of Stephen, Mason 
and Murphy JJ., in which the English cases I have mentioned were dis- 
cussed and analysed, it was held that “legal professional privilege” must 
be confined to documents brought into existence for the sole purpose of 4 
submission to legal advisers for advice or use in legal proceedings. 
Jacobs J. put the test in the form of a question, at p. 692: “.. . does 
the purpose ’—in the sense of intention, the iritended use—“ of supplying

the. material to the legal adviser account for the existence of the 
material? ” Barwick C.J. stated it in terms of “dominant” purpose. 
This is closely in line with the opinion of Lord Denning M.R. in the 
present case that the privilege extends only to material prepared 
“wholly or mainly for the purpose of preparing [the defendant’s) case.” 
The High Court of Australia and Lord Denning M.R. agree in refusing 
to follow Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London 
B and North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 and Ogden v. London 
Electric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542, as generally understood. 

My Lords, for the reasons I have given, when discussing the case in 
principle, I too would refuse to follow those cases. It appears to me that 
unless ‘the purpose of submission to the Jegal adviser in view of litigation 
is at least the dominant purpose for which the relevant document was 
prepared, the reasons which require privilege to be extended to it cannot 
apply. On the other hand to hold that the purpose, as above, must be the 
sole purpose would, apart from difficulties of proof, in my opinion, be 
too strict a requirement, and would confine the privilege too narrowly: as 
to this I agree with Barwick C.J. in Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, and 
in substance with Lord Denning M.R. While fully respecting the necessity 
for the Lords Justices to follow previous decisions of their court, I find 
D myself in the result in agreement with Lord Denning’s judgment. I would 
allow the appeal and order disclosure of the joint report. 


Lorp SIMON OF GLAISDALE. My Lords, the appellant’s late husband, 
an employee of the respondents, was killed in an accident on part of their 
railway system. In accordance with their usual practice, shared by many 
industrial and commercial undertakings in such circumstances, a report 

E was made about the accident. As so often, the report came into being 
partly for the purpose of ascertaining whether the working system was 
defective. and could be improved so as to obviate such accidents, partly 
for the purpose of informing the respondents’ solicitors in case of the 
threat or initiation of litigation, which, at the time when the report was 
made, was contemplated by the respondents as possible or probable. 

fF The report, as is usual, contains statements by -all such persons 
as could throw light on the circumstances of the accident, the majority of 
whom could be witnesses in any ensuing litigation. Litigation having in 
fact been started by the appellant against the respondents, the former has 
sought disclosure of the report to assist her in the preparation and/or 
conduct of her case. The respondents resist its disclosure, on the grauns 
that it is protected by legal professional privilege. 

G The situation being far from unusual, the issue has quite drécieritly 

been before the courts. The English authorities were meticulously reviewed 

by Havers J. in Seabrook y. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 

W.L.R. 509. His conclusion was that he was bound by what had been 

said by the majority of the Court of Appeal in Birmingham and Midland 

Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and North Western Railway Co. 

H_ [1913] 3 K.B. 850, and by the ensuing Court of Appeal decisions in Ankin 

v. London and North Eastern Railway Co. [1930] 1 K.B. 527 and Ogden 

v. London Electric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542. The law thus laid 

down was that such a report need not be disclosed if one of its purposes

(even ‘though subsidiary) was to inform the solicitor with a view to A 
litigation contemplated as possible or probable. That this-was the correct 
distillation of the prevailing case law was recognised by Diplock J. in 
Longthorn Vv. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 W.L.R. 530; though 

he deftly avoided its application. It was also recognised as the prevailing 
English: law, and: applied, by various Canadian courts: see Northern 
Construction Co. Vv. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (1970) 

75 W.W.R. 21; Vernon v. Board of Education for the Borough of North B 
York (1975).9 O.R.(2d) 613; Reg. in Right of Canada v. Hawker Siddeley 
Canada Ltd. (1976) 73 D.L.R. (3d) 453. In New Zealand, too, the 
Court of: Appeal held that to attract privilege its use in reasonably 
apprehended litigation need not be the only purpose of the document 
(though it must be an appreciable purpose): Konia v. Morley [1976] 1 
N.Z.L.R. 455. Ankin v. London and North Eastern Railway Co. [1930] 
‘1s K.B. 527 -and Ogden v. London Electric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542 
being English Court of Appeal decisions, the law declared there was 
binding on, and: applied by the majority of, the Court of Appeal in the 
instant case. 

'' The earlier authorities are, however ‘by no means so categorical; and 
the views of Hamilton L.J. in Birmingham and'Midland Motor Omnibus 
Co. Ltd. v. London and North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 D 
were preferred, though not as a matter of decision, by the majority of the 
members of the Appellate Committee in Alfred Crompton Amusement 
Machines Ltd. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners (No. 2) [1974] 
A.C. 405; and it was the Birmingham case which was the foundation of 
Ankin and Ogden. In Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, the majority of 

the High Court in Australia took those earlier authorities into account E 
and also the doubt that had been thrown on the more recent ones in 
Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd. v. Customs and Excise 
Commissioners (No. 2); and, weighing various other considerations, held 
that to attract privilege the use of the document for reasonably anticipated 
litigation must be its sole purpose. Barwick C.J., at p. 677, “Having 
considered the decisions, the writings and the various aspects of the 
public interest which claim attention,” thought that use of the document F 
either for legal advice or to be used in reasonably apprehended litigation 
had to be the dominant purpose in order to attract privilege from dis- 
closure. The Law Reform Committee, in its Sixteenth Report (Privilege 

in ‘Civil Proceedings) (1967) (Cmnd. 3472) thought that, under the sub- 
sisting English law, the test of privilege was that the document should 

be “wholly or mainly” for the purpose of preparing one’s case in G 
litigation then pending or contemplated (para. 17); and, although I do not 
myself consider that that was the prevailing law (nor, indeed, I think, did 
Lord Denning MLR. in the instant case, for all that he favoured it as the 
test),-the views of such an eminent committee are entitled to pret 
respect. 

- The upshot ‘of this cursory conspectus of the authorities is that your 
Lordships are, in my view, free to consider the issue on grounds of 
principle and convenience, unembarrasséd by previous authority, which, 
rather, constitutes diverse springboards. The appellant argues that the

A correct test is that preferred by the majority of the High Court in: 
Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, namely the sole purpose; or,. alterna= 
tively, that preferred by Barwick C.J. in that case, namely the dominant 
purpose. The respondents argue that Ankin v. London and North 
Eastern Railway Co. [1930] 1 K.B. 527 and Ogden. v. London Electric 
Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542, were correctly decided, and that it is 
sufficient to attract privilege from disclosure if one of the purposes 

B (however subsidiary) is with a view to apprehended litigation. 

The issue exemplifies a situation which frequently causes difficulties— 
where the forensic situation is covered by two valid legal principles which 
point each to a different forensic conclusion. Here, indeed, both principles 
subserve the same legal end—the administration of justice. The first 
principle is that the relevant rules of law should be applied to the 

c_ Whole body of relevant evidence—in other words, in principle all relevant 

evidence should be adduced to the court. The report in question in this 

appeal undoubtedly contains information relevant to the matters in issue 
in the litigation here. The first principle thus indicates that it should be 
disclosed, so that the appellant may make use of it if she wishes. 

The second general principle arises out of the adversary (in contradic- 
tion to the inquisitorial) system of administration of justice. Society 
provides an objective code of law and courts where civil contentions 
can be decided. But it contents itself with so providing a forum and a 
code (and nowadays some finance for those who could not otherwise 
get. justice). Having done so much, society considers that it can safely 
leave each party to bring forward the evidence and argument to. establish 
his/her case, detaching the judge from the hurly-burly of contestation 
E and so enabling him to view the rival contentions dispassionately. It is 

true that this does not .in itself give rise to legal professional privilege. 

Sir Thomas -More;, before his. time for judicial and administrative 

responsibility, had a different system for the Utopians: 


*“ For they thinke it most mete, that euery man shuld pléadé his owne 
matter, and tell the same tale before the ‘iudge, that he would tel to 
F .__ his man of lawe. So shall there be lesse circumstaunce of wordes, 
and the trwth ‘shal soner cum to light; whiles the -iudge with a 
discrete judgement doth waye the wordes of hym whom.no lawier 
hath ‘instruct with deceit; and whiles he helpeth and beareth out 
simple wittes agaynst the false and malicious circumuertions of craftié 
chyldren.” (Utopia, 1516, tr. Ralph Robinson; 1551; Bk. 2, [ch:°7].) 


G This is all very. fine; but that great moralist and master -of. common 
sense, Dr. Johnson, saw.the snag. Quite apart, from. the descent of the 
judge into the arena: . ee A ok 


“As it rarely happens that a man is fit 1 ‘to plead his own’ causé, 
lawyers are a class of the community, who, by: study and experience, 
have ‘acquired the art: and power of arranging evidence, and- of 
H applying to the points at issue what the law has settled: A lawyer 
is to do for his client all that his client might fairly do for himself; 
if -he could.” (Boswell, Life of Johnson, ed. Birkbeck Hill- (1950), 
vol. v, 26). eo yea, over ee

ied ince Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(E.) ) [1980] 
So the adversary system calls for legal representation if it is to operate 
with such justice as is vouchsafed to humankind. 

. This system of adversary forensic procedure with legal professional 
advice and representation demands that communications between lawyer 
and client should be confidential, since the lawyer is for the purpose of 
litigation merely the client’s alter ego. So too material which is to go 
into the lawyer’s (i.e. the client’s) brief or file for litigation. This is the 
basis for the privilege against disclosure of material collected by or on B 
behalf of a client for the use of his lawyer in pending or anticipated 
litigation: see Cotton L.J. in Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. Vv. 
Quick (1878) 3 Q.B.D. 315, 321-322; D. v. National Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] A.C. 171, 231; Sixteenth 
Report of the Law Reform Committee, paras. 17-21. Apart from 
the limited exception of some expert evidence, for which the Rules 
of the Supreme Court make express provision (Ord. 38, r. 37), a 
party in civil litigation is not entitled to see the adversary’s proofs of 
what his witnesses will say at the trial; there has been no suggestion 
that he should be so entitled; and any such development would require 
the most careful consideration based on widespread consultation. The 
report. in question in this appeal undoubtedly contains material collected 
by or on behalf of the respondents for the use of their solicitors in anti- D 
cipated litigation. The second principle thus indicates that the respon- 
dents are entitled to claim that it is confidential as between themselves 
and. their solicitors and that they are not bound to disclose it. 

.’ Historically, the second principle—that a litigant must bring forward 
his own evidence to support his case, and cannot call on his adversary 

to make or aid it—was fundamental to the outlook of the courts of 
common law. The first principle—that the opponent might be compelled E 
to disclose relevant evidence in his possession—was the doctrine of the 
Chancery, a court whose conscience would be affronted by forensic success 
contrary to justice obtained merely through the silent non-cooperation 

of the defendant (see Y.B. 9 Ed. IV, Trin. 9), and which therefore had 
some. inclination to limited inquisitorial procedures. The conflict between 

the Chancery and the courts of common law was, here as elsewhere, fF 
ultimately resolved by compromise and accommodation. 

I can see no intrinsic reason why the one principle rather than the 
other should prevail in a situation where they are counter-indicative. 
Neither is absolute: both: are subject to numerous exceptions. For 
example, if a document protected by legal professional privilege (or 
secondary evidence of it) has been obtained by the opposite party 
independently—even through the default of the legal adviser—even by G 
dishonesty—either will probably be admissible: Phipson on Evidence, 
12th ed. (1976), p. 241, para. 584; Sixteenth Report of the Law Reform 
Committee, para. 31. The numerous exceptions to the principle that all 
relevant evidence should be disclosed arise partly from historical reasons 
(the tensions ‘between the courts of common law, where questions of 
fact weré tried, and the Court of Chancery, where the remedy of discovery 
was developed), partly from considerations of justice, partly from wider 
social considerations: see D. v. National Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Children [1978] A.C. 171, at pp. 231 et seq. Thus the

AC, Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(E.) ) toa Sac 


A historical exclusion of hearsay evidence, “‘ the best evidence” rule and 
“without prejudice’ communications are examples of exceptions to 
the principle of adduction of all relevant evidence. So too is the rule 
excluding, in general, evidence going merely to the discredit of a witness, 
even though the credibility of the witness may be decisive of the case. 
But the exception which most nearly touches the issue facing your 
Lordships was cogently invoked in this very connection by James L.J. 

‘B in Anderson v. Bank of British Columbia, 2 Ch:D. 644, 656: 


“ 


. as you have no right to see your adversary’s brief, you have 
no right to see that which comes into existence merely as the materials 
for the brief.” 


The adversary’s brief will contain much relevant material; nevertheless, 
Cc you cannot see it because that would be inconsistent with the adversary 
forensic process based on legal representation. I would, though, draw 
attention to the word “merely” in James L.J.’s dictum. 

There is, then, no a priori reason why the one general principle should 
yield to the other. But in my judgment each party’s main contention 
would virtually result in the total exclusion of the principle relied on by 
the other. The rule in Ogden in effect means that reports such as that 
in the instant case will always be excluded, because it is unlikely that 
there is not in such circumstances even the subsidiary purpose of inform- 
ing the legal advisers. On the other hand, to enjoin that privilege can 
only be claimed if the information of legal advisers is the sole purpose 
of the report will in effect mean that such reports must always be dis- 
closed, because it is unlikely that in such circumstances there will not be 
E even the subsidiary purpose of ascertaining whether the system of work 
can be improved. Indeed, in this type of report causation and fault can 
hardly be kept apart. 

Your Lordships will therefore, I apprehend, be seeking some inter- 
mediate line which will allow each of the two general principles scope 
in its proper sphere. Various intermediate formulae as a basis for 
the privilege have been canvassed in argument before your Lordships, 
most based on some authority—the obtaining of legal advice was “an 
appreciable purpose”; “a substantial purpose”; “the substantial 
purpose”; it was “wholly or mainly” for that purpose; that was its 
“dominant ” purpose; that was its “ primary” purpose. 

Some of these are in my view too vague. Some ‘give little or no 
scope to the principle of open litigation with the minimum exclusion of 
G relevant evidence. The one that appeals most to me is “dominant” 

purpose, as it did. to Barwick C.J. in Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674. 

It allows scope to each of the governing principles. It seems to me less 

quantitative than “mainly”; and I think it would be easier to apply— 

the law is already cognisant of the concept of a dominant purpose—in 
the law of conspiracy, for example (see Crofter Hand Woven Harris 
H Tweed Co. Ltd. v. Veitch [1942] A.C. 435, especially at pp. 445 

(Viscount Simon L.C.), 452 (Viscount Maugham) ), and in the law as to 

fraudulent preference in bankruptcy (see Halsbury’s Laws of England, 

4th ed., vol. 3 (1973), pp. 496, 499, paras. 908, 913).

I would therefore overrule Ankin v. London and North Eastern A 
Railway Co. [1930] 1 K.B. 527 and Ogden v. London Electric Railway 
Co., 49 T.L.R. 542. 

My noble and learned friend on the Woolsack has already cited the 
crucial passages from the affidavit of Mr. Hastings. These show that 
the procuring of legal advice or preparation for litigation was not the 
dominant purpose of the report. It follows that the claim for legal 
professional :privilege fails, and the report must be disclosed. B 

Accordingly, I would allow the appeal. 


Lorp Epmunpb-Daviges. My Lords, the circumstances of the fatal 
accident on May 4, 1976, giving rise to this litigation have already been 
related by my noble and learned friend Lord Wilberforce. A copy of 
the short report sent the same day by the respondent board to the ¢ 
Ministry of Transport in accordance with section 6 of the Regulation of 
Railways Act 1871 has been furnished to the appellant’s solicitors. They 
have also been supplied with a copy of the report of October 29, 1976, 
prepared by the Railway Inspectorate of the Department of Transport. 
But what has not been disclosed is the May 6, 1976, report based upon 
a joint internal inquiry conducted by the board’s personnel. The 
importance to the appellant of such a report, made only two days after D 
the accident and. when the memory of witnesses were fresh, is manifest. 
But from the outset disclosure of its contents has been resisted. In their 
list of documents the board claimed that they were 


“.. . documents which came into existence and were made by the 
defendants or their officers or servants after this litigation was in 
contemplation and in view of such litigation for the purpose of E 
obtaining for and furnishing to the solicitor of the defendants 
evidence and information as to the evidence which will be obtained 

or otherwise for the use of the said solicitor to enable him to 
conduct the defence in this action or to advise the defendants.” 


‘But that the reports referred to were not made solely for litigation 
purposes emerged when the board, being nevertheless pressed for dis- 
closure of the -internal inquiry report, responded by an affidavit sworn 
by Mr. Hastings, assistant to the general manager of their Eastern 
Region. So important is it that I must quote from it at some length: 


“6. It has long been.the practice of the board and its predecessors 

‘:, to require that returns and reports.on all accidents occurring on the 
“+ railway and joint internal departmental inquiries into the causes of G 

‘the said .accident be .made by the local officers of the board who 

would forward them to their superiors in order to assist in establish- 

ing the cduses of such accidents. 7. Such reports and the statements 

of witnesses to such accidents are made for the purposes mentioned 

.. in paragraphs 3 and 6 of this affidavit and equally for the purpose 
> of being submitted to the board’s solicitor as material upon which yy 

. he can advise the board upon its legal liability and for the purpose 

‘.. of conducting on behalf of the board any proceedings arising out of 

such accidents.. 8. This system of reporting accidents and making

AC, Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(E.)) Lord Edmund-Davies 


joint internal departmental inquiries into the causes of the said, 
_ accidents and laying down the necessary instructions to the relevant 
staff to do so for the purposes aforesaid continues today. “9. It- is 
commonly anticipated by the board that: (a) where an employee of 
the board suffers personal injury: or death at work ‘or (b) where a 
passenger suffers loss [or] personal. injury or, death while -on. or 
_- about the railway a claim for damages will be made against the 
B board and. proceedings will ensue if liability is repudiated. The 
- present action is brought as the result of a fatal accident suffered at 
work by the late husband of the plaintiff and it was anticipated from 
the very outset that a claim for damages would almost certainly 
ensue. 10. The documents in this action namely the reports made 
by the board’s officers and servants and the report referred to in 
. correspondence as the internal inquiry report:for which the defendants. 
have claimed privilege in part 2 of the first schedule of their list of 
documents dated November 11, 1977, came into existence by reason 
of the fact that the appropriate officer, in this case the divisional 
manager at: Newcastle, in accordance with long standing practice 
was required to and did so call for such reports and statements. 
One of the principal purposes for so doing was so that they could 
D be passed to the board’s chief solicitor to enable him to advise the 
board on its legal liability and if necessary conduct its defence to 
these proceedings. 11. The internal inquiry report in fact states on 
the face of it that it has finally to be sent to the solicitor for the 
purpose of enabling him to advise the board.” 


Pe 


In the light of such affidavit, counsel for the appellant accepts that he 

E cannot challenge that litigation arising out of the fatal accident was 
anticipated when the report of May 6, 1976, was prepared: see Jones 
v. Monte Video Gas Co. (1880) 5 Q.B.D. 556. The fact that the report 
states on its face that it has finally to be sent to the Solicitor for the 
purpose of enabling him to advise the board cannot, however, be deter- 
minative of the outcome of this appeal, for, as the Lord President (Lord 

F Strathclyde) said in Whitehill v. Glasgow Corporation, 1915 S.C. 1015, 
1017—quoted with approval by Lord Kilbrandon in’ Alfred Crompton 
Amusement Machines Ltd. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners (No. ?) 
[1974] A.C. 405, 435-436: 


“These words cannot alter the character of the report which is.made 
by the employee for the purpose of informing his employers of the 
G accident, and made at the time.” 


My Lords, in the light of their own affidavit, are the board. entitled 
to resist disclosure? There is a very large body of case Jaw on the topic 
of legal professional privilege, much of which was reviewed in Seabrook 
v. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 W.L.R. 509 by Havers J., 
who quoted extensively from earlier decisions. It would not, I think, be 

H_ helpful were I to make a further attempt to do that which that learned 
judge so admirably accomplished. Instead, I propose to consider first 
whether Eveleigh L.J. and Sir David Cairns in the present case were 
right in holding that the earlier Court of Appeal decisions in Birmingham 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-1 Filed 03/14/16 Page 21 of 26 
540 
Lord Edmund-Davies Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(E.) ) [1980] 


and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. vy. London and North Western 
Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 and Ogden v. London Electric Railway A 
Co., 49 T.L.R.. 542 compelled them to dismiss the plaintiff's appeal from 
the decision of Donaldson J. refusing disclosure. 

In the Birmingham case Buckley L.J. (with whom Vaughan Williams 
L.J. concurred) said, at p. 856: 


“It is not I think necessary that the affidavit should state that the 
information was obtained solely or merely or primarily for the B 
solicitor, if it was obtained for the solicitor, in the sense of being 
procured as materials upon which professional advice should be 
taken in proceedings pending, or threatened, or anticipated.” 


That passage was cited with approval in Ogden v. London Electric 
Railway Co., the facts of which were strikingly similar to those of the 
present case, Scrutton L.J. saying, at pp. 543-544, with reference to a C© 
non-privileged purpose for which accident reports had been obtained: 


“Tt may be that that is part of the purpose of making the reports, 
but there is also the substantial purpose that if a writ is issued these 
are the materials that will be wanted by the solicitor conducting the 
litigation, and they are obtained for that purpose, among others, and 
as appears from the form at which we look . . . the reports are made 
on a form headed: ‘For the information of the company’s solicitors 
only,’ which is a very important heading to have, because if you 
know that you are making a confidential report to the solicitor you 
are much more likely to state accurately what has happened than if 
you are afraid that somebody presently seeing that report may take 
proceedings against you in respect of the statements that you have 
made, which may be defamatory.” (Italics added.) 


I have already indicated my inability (in concurrence with Lord Denning 
M.R. in the present case) to have regard to such a heading. Nevertheless, 
Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and 
North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 and Ogden v. London 
Electric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542, are authorities for the proposition 
that reports such as that compiled in the instant case two days after the 
fatal accident are privileged even though they were obtained for other 
purposes as well as to meet impending or anticipated litigation. And 
they led the majority of the Court of Appeal to hold here that the 
internal inquiry report need not be disclosed, Eveleigh L.J. going to the 
length of saying: G 
“, . I believe that in so far as this court is concerned it has been 
firmly established that the documents in question in the present case 
are privileged. They were obtained for the purpose of being sent to 
the solicitors to serve in preparing the defendant’s case for litigation 
which was anticipated. And they would also be used for another 
very substantial and even more important purpose. On the authori- y 
ties I do not believe that this entitles me to say that the privilege 
which otherwise would have attached [to them] has been removed.”

AC, | Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(E.)) | Lord Edmund-Davies 


But Lord Denning M.R.., in the course of his dissenting judgment, refused 
to be bound by such earlier Court of Appeal decisions. Instead, he 
adverted to the view expressed in the Sixteenth Report of the Law 
Reform Committee, para. 17, that 


“_.. it is, we think, essential... that [a party] should be entitled 
to insist upon there being withheld from the court any material 
which came into existence . . . wholly or mainly for the purpose.of 
preparing his case in litigation then pending or contemplated by him.” 


Lord Denning M.R. added: 


“We should not extend it further. If material comes into being for 
a dual purpose—one to find out the cause of the accident—the other 
to furnish information to the solicitor—it should be disclosed, 

Cc because it is not then ‘wholly or mainly’ for litigation. On this 
basis all the reports and inquiries into accidents—which are made 
shortly after the accident—should be disclosed on discovery and 
made available in evidence at the trial.” 


Applying that test to the facts of this case, Lord Denning MLR. said: 


“The main purpose of this inquiry and report was to ascertain the 
cause of the accident and to prevent further accidents or similar 
occurrences. Its nearby purpose was to put before the departmental 
inspectorate. Its far-off purpose was to put before the solicitors of 
the board, should a claim be made and litigation ensue.” 


My Lords, it will later emerge how closely I am at one with Lord 
E Denning M.R. in this matter. I must, however, say that I am in respectful 
agreement with the view adopted by Eveleigh L.J. and Sir David Cairns 
that Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. London and 
North Western Railway Co. [1913] 3 K.B. 850 and Ogden v. London 
Electric Railway Co., 49 T.L.R. 542, were binding upon the Court of 
Appeal and that none of the many other cases cited—such as Jones V. 
Great Central Railway Co. [1910] A.C. 4, Alfred Crompton Amusement 
F Machines Ltd. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners (No. 2) [1974] 
A.C. 405, Seabrook v. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 W.L.R. 509 
and Longthorn v. British Transport Commission [1959] 1 W.L.R. 530— 
enabled them to escape from that thraldom. In these circumstances, I 
regard it as fortunate for justice that an appeal has reached this House, 
for in my judgment a grievous wrong might have been done had Master 
G Bickford Smith’s original order in favour of disclosure not been finally 
upheld. 
It is for the party refusing disclosure to establish his right to refuse. 
It may well be that in some cases where that right has in the past been 
upheld the courts have failed to keep clear the distinction between (a) 
communications between client and legal adviser, and (b) communications 
between the client and third parties, made (as the Law Reform Committee 
put it) 
“.. for the purpose of obtaining information to be submitted to the 
client’s professional legal advisers for the purpose of obtaining advice

upon pending ‘or contemplated litigation.”’. (Sixteenth Report, A 
para. 17 (c).) : : 


In cases falling within (a), privilege from disclosure attaches to com- 
munications for the purpose of obtaining legal advice and it is immaterial 
whether or not the possibility of: litigation were even contemplated, 
Kindersley V.-C. saying in Lawrence v. Campbell (1859) 4 Drew. 485, 
490: B 
“|, it is not now necessary as it fonuealy was for the purpose of 
obtaining production that the communications should be made either 
during or relating to an actual or even to an expected litigation. It 
is sufficient if they pass as professional communications in a 
professional capacity.” 


But in cases falling within (b) the position is quite otherwise. Litigation, © 
apprehended or actual, is its hallmark. Referring to “the rule which 
protects confidential communications from discovery as regards the other 
side,” Sir George Jessel M.R. said in Anderson v. Bank of British 
Columbia, 2.Ch.D. 644, 649: 


“The object and meaning of the rule is this: that as, by reason of 
the complexity and difficulty of our law, litigation can only be D 
properly conducted by professional men, it is absolutely necessary 
that a man, in order to prosecute his rights or to defend himself 
from an improper claim, should have recourse to the assistance of 
professional lawyers, and it being so absolutely necessary, it is equally 
_ hecessary,.to use a vulgar phrase, that he should be able to make a 
clean breast of it to ‘the gentleman whom he consults with a view 
to the prosecution of his claim, or the substantiating his defence 
against the claim of others; that he should be able to place un- 
restricted and unbounded confidence in the professional agent, and 
that the communications he so makes to him should be kept secret, 
unless with his consent (for it is his privilege, and not the privilege 
of the confidential agent), that he should be enabled properly to 
conduct his litigation. That is the meaning of the rule.” , oF 


And in the Court of Appeal James L.J. summed up the position, at 
P- 656, by speaking succinctly of 


“. . an intelligible principle, that as you have no right to see your 
adversary’s ‘brief, you have no right to see that which comes into 
existence merely as the materials for the brief.” G 


Preparation with a view to litigation—pending or anticipated—being 
thus the essential purpose which protects a communication from disclosure 
in such cases as the present, what in the last resort is the touchstone of 
the privilege? Is it sufficient that the prospect of litigation be merely 
one of the several purposes leading to the communication coming into 
being? And is that sufficient (as Eveleigh L.J. in the present case held) yy 
despite the fact that there is also ‘“‘ another .. . and even more important 
purpose”? Is it enough that the prospect of litigation is a substantial 
purpose, though. there may be othérs equally substantial? Is an

appreciable .purpose sufficient? Or does it have ‘to be the main ‘purpose? 
Or one of its main purposes (as in Ogden v. London Electric Railway 
Co., 49 T.L.R. 542)?. Ought your Lordships to declare that privilege 
attaches only to material which (in the words of Lord Denning M.R.) 

“comes within the words ‘wholly or mainly’ for the purpose of 
litigation” ? Or should this House adopt the majority decision of the 
High Court of Australia in Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, that legal 
B professional privilege must be confined to documents. brought into 
existence for the sole purpose of submission to legal advisers for advice 
or for use in legal proceedings? 

. An affirmative answer to each of the foregoing questions can be 
supported by one or more of the many reported decisions. And so can 
a negative answer. But no. decision is binding upon this House, and 
your Lordships are accordingly in the fortunate position of being free to 
choose and declare what is the proper test. And in my judgment we 
should start from the basis that the public interest is, on balance, best 
served by rigidly confining within narrow limits the cases: where material 
relevant to litigation may be lawfully withheld. Justice is better served 
by candour than by suppression. For, as it was put in the Granf v., 
Downs majority judgment, at p. 686: “.. . the privilege . . . detracts 
D from the fairness of the trial by denying a party access to relevant 
documents or at least subjecting him to surprise.’ 

Adopting that approach, I would certainly deny a claim to privilege 
when litigation was merely one of several purposes of equal or similar 
importance intended to be served by the material sought to be withheld 
from disclosure, and a fortiori where it was merely a minor purpose. 
On the other hand, I consider that it would be going too far to adopt 
the “sole purpose” test applied by the majority in -Grant v. Downs, 
which has been adopted in no United Kingdom decision nor, as far as 
we are aware, elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Its adoption would 
deny privilege even to material whose outstanding purpose is to serve 
litigation, simply because another and very minor purpose was also being 
served. But, inasmuch.as the only basis.of the claim to privilege in such: 
cases as the present one is that the material in question was brought 
into existence for use’ in legal proceedings, it is surely right to insist 
that, before the claim is conceded or upheld, such a purpose must be 
shown to have played a paramount-part. Which phrase or ‘epithet should 
be’ selected to designate this is.a matter of individual judgment. Lord 
. Denning M.R., as we have séen, favoured adoption of the phrase employed. 
in the Law Reform Committee’s Sixteenth Report, viz., “* material which. 
came into existence . . . wholly or mainly” for the purpose of litigation 
(para. 17). ‘ “ Wholly” I personally would reject for the same reason as 
I dislike “solely,” but “ mainly” is nearer what I regard as the prefer- 
able test. Even so, it lacks the element of. clear paramountcy which 
should, as I think, be the touchstone. After considerable ‘deliberation, I 
have finally come down in favour of the test propounded by. Barwick 
C.J. in Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, in the ne WOLss at. 
p. 677: oe " 4

Lord Edmund-Davies Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(E) ) [1980] 


“Having considered the decisions, the writings and the various 
-aspects of the public interest which claim attention, I have come to 
the conclusion that the court should state the relevant principle as 
‘.. follows: a document which was produced or brought into existence 
either with the dominant purpose of its author, or of the person or 
authority under whose direction, whether particular or general, it 
was produced or brought into existence, of using it or its contents 
in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct B 
. of litigation, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect, 
should be privileged and excluded from inspection.” (Italics added.). 


A 


Dominant purpose, then, in my judgment, should now be declared by 
this House to be the touchstone. It is less stringent a test than “sole” 
purpose, for, as Barwick C.J. added, 135 C.L.R. 674, 677: 


“ ., the fact that the person... had in mind other uses of the C 
document will not preclude that document being accorded privilege, 
if it were produced with the requisite dominant purpose.” 


_ Applying such test to the facts of the present case, we have already 
seen that privilege was claimed in Mr. Hastings’s affidavit on several 
grounds. Thus, the report of May 6, 1976, was produced in accordance 
with the long-standing practice of the board regarding “accidents occur- 
ring on or about any railway ... in order to assist in establishing the 
causes of such accidents,” and this whether or not (so your Lordships 
were informed) any personal injuries were sustained and even where 
there was no prospect of litigation ensuing. This particular report was 
called for in accordance with such practice and: 


“ One of the principal purposes for so doing was so that they could E 
be passed to the board’s chief solicitor to enable him to advise the 
board on its legal liability and if necessary conduct its defence to 

_ these proceedings.” (Italics added.) 


Were the “sole purpose” test adopted and applied, on the board’s own 
showing their claim to privilege must fail. Then what of the “dominant F 
purpose ” test which I favour? Dominance again is not claimed by the 
board, but merely that use in litigation was: “one of the principal 
purposes.” Such moderation is only to be expected in the face of a 
claim arising out .of a fatal accident. Indeed, the claims of humanity 
must surely make the dominant purpose of any report upon an accident 
(particularly where personal injuries have been sustained) that of discover- 
ing. what happened and why it happened, so that.measures to prevent G 
its recurrence could be discussed and, if possible, devised. And, although 
Barwick C.J. in Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674, observed, at p. 677, that 
“ , . the circumstance that the document is a ‘routine document’ 
- will not be definitive. The dominant purpose of its production may 
none the. less: qualify it for professional privilege,” 


the test of dominance ‘will, as I think, be difficult to satisfy when inquiries 
are instituted ‘and reports: produced automatically whenever any mishap 
occurs, whatever its nature, its gravity, or even its triviality.

AC, Waugh v. British Railways Board (H.L.(£) ) Lord Edmund-Davies 


My Lords, if, as I hold, “dominant purpose” be the right test of 

A privilege from disclosure, it follows that the board’s claim to privilege 

must be disallowed, and the same applies if the “sole purpose” test be 

applied. I would therefore allow this appeal and restore the order of 
Master Bickford Smith in favour of disclosure. 


Lorp RUSSELL OF KILLOWEN. My Lords, it has already been 

B demonstrated by my noble and learned friend Lord Wilberforce that if, 

in order to attract privilege from its production, it is necessary that the 

joint internal report should owe its genesis: to either the sole or the 

dominant purpose that it should be used for the purpose of obtaining 

legal advice in possible or probable litigation, the evidence in this case 

falls short of both those standards. At the conclusion of the arguments 

in this appeal I was minded, while agreeing that anything less than the 

Cc standard of the dominant purpose would not suffice to support a claim 

for privilege from production, to prefer the higher standard of the sole 

purpose, in line with as I understand them the judgments of the majority 

in the High Court of Australia in Grant v. Downs, 135 C.L.R. 674. It 

appeared to me that such a standard had the merit of greater simplicity 

in a decision on a claim for privilege from production, as being a line 

D easier to draw and to apply to the facts of a particular case. However 

on reflection I am persuaded that the standard of sole purpose would be 

in most, if not all, cases impossible to attain, and that to impose it would 

tilt the balance of policy in this field too sharply against the possible 

defendant. Moreover to select the standard of dominant purpose is not 

to impose a definition too difficult of measurement. It is to be met 

with in other fields of the law, of which I need instance only the question 

in bankruptcy law whether there has been a fraudulent preference of a 
creditor. 

In summary, therefore, my Lords, I am in agreement with the speech 
of my noble and learned friend Lord Wilberforce, and would allow this 
appeal and order the production to the plaintiff of the joint internal 
report. 


Lorp KEITH oF KINKEL. My Lords, I have had the advantage of 
reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend Lord 
Wilberforce. I agree with it, and accordingly I too would allow the 
appeal. 


Appeal allowed with costs.

Mr Justice Mann: 


Background 


1. 


The two applications before me are related applications which turn on the question of 
legal professional privilege and, to a more limited extent, general obligations of 
disclosure and listing. In 1998 the claimants prepared, or caused to be prepared, 
documentation for a warranty scheme which they sought to sell to retailers to replace 
insurance based schemes which had been rendered commercially unattractive by a 
change in the tax regime. A Mr Chan and a Mr Cooper, solicitors on the Isle of Man, 
devised a scheme involving moneys being held off-shore and in trust. In the course of 
devising the scheme a document known in these proceedings as a CAA (an acronym for 
Collections Account Agreement) was prepared. Copyright in that document vested in the 
second claimant; in due course it was transferred to the first claimant. I shall not 
distinguish between those two companies for the purposes of this judgment (because it is 
not necessary to do so) and shall treat all relevant copyright and confidentiality rights as 
being vested in what I will call "USP". The CAA came into the possession of the first 
defendant ("LGH") because that company was, at the time, the administrator of the 
scheme in question ("the Scottish Power scheme"), but it was the subject of a 
confidentiality agreement. Modifications were carried out to it, and a finalised version 
was used in that scheme. As a result of joint input into the final document, the judge at 
the hearing on liability referred to below found that copyright in that final version vested 
jointly in Scottish Power and USP. 

In 2000 the claimants and LGH were rivals in bidding to participate in another scheme, 
this time for an entity which I will call Powerhouse. In this context LGH and the other 
two defendants, who are all companies in the same group (the AON group), used the final 
form draft CAA as a starting point for the drafting of a similar document which they put 
forward in their bid to devise and operate a scheme for Powerhouse. In doing so they are 
said to have been able to maintain a bidding position in competition with the claimants 
until Powerhouse ultimately decided that the claimants' scheme was one that they 
preferred. In a judgment delivered on 8" November 2002 HH Judge Weeks QC held that 
that use was an infringement of the copyright in the 1998 original and a breach of 
confidentiality, and he ordered an inquiry as to the damages arising from those wrongs. 
That inquiry is not confined to the actual breaches that he found; it is set to be held at the 
end of April before a Master. 

In the context of the inquiry questions of privilege arise. In the course of considering their 
participation in the Powerhouse scheme LGH instructed lawyers on the Isle of Man. The 
results of their deliberations were apparently passed to Powerhouse. It is in relation to 
that advice and certain matters passing among the defendants and between the defendants 
and Powerhouse that privilege questions arise. In addition, the inquiry will consider 
infringements relating to another transaction in relation to a concern identified as Apollo. 
The defendants, or their group, did enter into a scheme with Apollo, and it is not alleged 
that the final scheme involved the use of any documents over which copyright or 
confidentiality is claimed. However, it is said that at some stage consideration was given 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 5 of 30 


to using the CAA, and that there were infringements at that stage of the transaction. 
Questions of privilege and disclosure arise in relation to that too. 


The Powerhouse claim facts — detail 


The background to this matter leading up to the infringements found by HH Judge Weeks 
is set out in some detail in his judgment; I do not propose to set them out again here. For 
present purposes I can take the story up at the beginning of 2000. At that point of time, as 
HH Judge Weeks QC stated, LGH and USP found themselves in competition. The 
claimants offered their scheme at a given price (the details do not matter). A Mr 
Brimacombe of LGH had a copy of the Scottish Power CAA on his computer. It was 
copied for a Mr Mian, a sales director of LGH, with names blanked out. In due course it 
was sent to Powerhouse's lawyers, on 7" March (which was the infringement relied on 
and established at the trial). Part of the case of the claimants is that the defendants did this 
in order to establish that they had a workable (or "robust", as it was put at the time) 
scheme, so that they remained in the game. That gave Powerhouse competing bidders and 
they were able to play one off against the other. As a result of this Powerhouse were able 
to come back to the claimants at the end of March and negotiate a reduction in the price 
quoted. A deal was done at that reduced price. This reduction in price forms part of the 
damages claim. The claimants say that the infringement helped to keep the defendants in 
the running, and the fact that they were in the running enabled Powerhouse to come back 
and require a reduction in price. I do not need to consider this chain of causation — that is 
a matter for the inquiry. 

However, the claimants also now rely on earlier matters. The claimants seek to establish 
an earlier breach. I have already referred to a reduction of price at the end of March. 
However, earlier, on 1‘ March 2000 Powerhouse had been also been able to negotiate a 
reduction in price from the claimants. In the inquiry the claimants will seek to establish 
that that reduction was attributable to earlier infringements. In mid-February 2000 LGH 
had sought advice from Manx lawyers. According to a chronology submitted by Mr 
Monson, who appeared for the defendants, a letter from Mr de Freitas, the solicitor acting 
for the defendants, stated that: 


"The nature of the advice sought from the solicitors in the Isle of Man concerned whether 
a trust based arrangement could be set up to protect monies from the Powerhouse scheme 
from being merged, or treated as merged, with other moneys held by AWS for other 
clients"; 


but at the same time it was made clear that in providing those details privilege was not 
waived in the instructions and the advice. The claimants will seek to establish that in 
order to get that advice, the CAA was copied, and that copying was a further 
infringement of copyright and of confidentiality rights. The advice that was obtained was 
apparently passed on to Powerhouse; it is said that it was the subject of a confidentiality 
agreement operating between the defendants and Powerhouse. The agreement is dated 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 6 of 30 


15"" March 2000 and is made between "Aon Warranty Group" and Powerhouse Retail 
Ltd. The relevant clauses are as follows: 


In consideration of AON making available to the Recipient [i.e. Powerhouse] certain 
information, the Recipient hereby undertakes to AON in the terms set out below: 


Confidential Information 


For the purposes of this confidentiality agreement the expression Confidential 
Information includes information available (whether before or after this confidentiality 
agreement is agreed) in writing (including by fax) and other forms of electronic 
transmission (including but not limited to information relating to clients data belonging to 
AON, know-how, trade secrets and any other information concerning the Purpose and 
also any information or analyses derived from, containing or reflecting such 
information... 


The recipient shall: 


Keep the Confidential Information secret and confidential and not disclose any of it to 
any person other than the persons who need to know the same for the purposes of 
considering, evaluating, advising on or furthering the Purpose and whom the Recipient 
shall procure are informed of the terms of this confidentiality agreement and observe the 
terms of this confidentiality agreement as if they were party hereto; 


Only use the Confidential Information for the sole purpose of considering, evaluating, 
advising on or furthering the Purpose and, in particular, not for any other commercial 
purpose;... 


Keep the Confidential Information and any copies thereof secure and in such a way so as 
to prevent unauthorised access by any third party, shall not make copies of it or reproduce 
it in any form except for the purpose of supplying the same to those to whom disclosure 
is permitted in accordance with this confidentiality agreement. 


[There is a provision for the return of all written Confidential Information within 7 days 
of termination of the agreement]. 


The Purpose is defined as being the wish of the group to "[launch] an offshore extended 
warranty programme". 


In late February 2000, Mr Borrill of the claimants was told by Mr Turner of Powerhouse 
that their bid was still too high, and on 1** March 2000 Mr Turner was able to negotiate a 
drop in the price that the claimants had originally quoted for their scheme. This price 
drop was bigger in amount than that negotiated at the end of the month. The case of the 
claimants is that Mr Turner was only able to do this because of what he had been told by 
the defendants; and the defendants were only able to say what they said by dint of their 
legal advice; and they were only able to get that legal advice by infringing copyright in 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 7 of 30 


the CAA, and breaking the confidentiality agreement. Since this earlier price drop is 
greater than the later one, it is a more valuable part of the claimant's claim. The losses 
flowing from this price drop are a material part of what the claimants seek in this action 
as flowing from the wrongs alleged. Again, it is not for me to comment on the merits of 
this chain of causation. 

It is in the context of that earlier part of the claim that the material which is the subject of 
this part of the present application came into existence. I am not asked to rule on 
relevance; both parties accept that the documents and material that I have to consider are 
relevant. The question for me is whether it is privileged. The material, and the issues 
relating to each part of it, can be summarised as follows: 


a. There are documents or parts of documents where the documents have already 
been disclosed by the defendants but in respect of which privilege is claimed in 
whole or as to part. Where privilege is claimed as to the whole, the document has 
not been produced for inspection. Where it has been claimed in part, the allegedly 
privileged part has been obscured for the purposes of inspection. These 
documents are e-mail or letter correspondence passing between one or more of the 
defendants of the one part and Powerhouse of the other, one e-mail from the 
Manx solicitors to the third defendant, and one e-mail from the third defendant to 
the first defendant. 

b. Iam asked to strike out parts of certain witness statements which are said to refer 
to privileged communications in a manner which makes it improper for the 
witnesses to give evidence of that material. The witnesses are witnesses for the 
claimants. One is Mr Turner, who at certain points in his evidence makes 
reference to the legal advice which the defendants had told him they had received, 
and at one point sets out the terms of an e-mail referring to it. The second and 
third are Mr Borrill (a director of each of the claimant companies) and Mr Chan, 
another director and also a Manx solicitor. The allegedly objectionable parts of 
their witness statements are those containing what Mr Turner told them in the 
negotiations leading up to the Powerhouse contract, and in which Mr Turner made 
reference to the advice which the defendants had obtained on their (the 
defendants’) scheme. In Mr Chan's case objection is taken to a reference to legal 
advice which, it is to be inferred, he heard about from Mr Turner and one 
paragraph in an e-mail that he sent at the time which refers to the same sort of 
thing. 

c. Iam asked to order the removal from the evidence of part of two Powerhouse 
internal memoranda which Powerhouse has disclosed to the claimants and which 
contain, among other things, a reference to the legal advice which had been 
obtained in the Isle of Man. It is that reference which I am asked to order the 
deletion of. 

d. There was one document, a copy letter from LGH to Powerhouse (document 15), 
in respect of which privilege was originally maintained, but which on reflection 
was sought to be excluded from inspection on the grounds that further 
consideration of the letter indicated that it was not relevant. The parties agreed 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 8 of 30 


that that dispute would be resolved by my looking at the document and ruling on 
the point. The claimants have not seen it, but were happy to adopt that expedient. 

e. Iam asked to strike out parts of the Particulars of Claim in the inquiry on the 
footing that they are abusive because they refer to and rely on privileged material, 
or can only be pleaded because the claimants are in possession of material which 
has been obtained in infringement of the rights of the defendants. 

f. Iam asked to order that the defendants serve a formal list of documents in relation 
to the inquiry. 


The contentions of the parties 


Mr Monson, for the defendants, maintains that privilege exists in all the material that he 
seeks to have excluded, and that it has not been waived. That being the case, the 
documentary material containing privileged material ought to be excluded, with limited 
exceptions. All the material fell within the proper definition of material that was the 
subject of legal professional privilege. For the purposes of the exercise of analysis, and to 
distinguish various types of material for the purposes of the debate, the written material 
was divided into three categories or levels: 

a. Level | — this was a reference which merely referred to the fact of getting 
solicitors advice, without indicating the instructions, advice or even the subject 
matter. 

b. Level 2 — these were indications that advice had been obtained from solicitors, 
and indicating its subject matter but not its content or the instructions given. 

c. Level 3 — written advice, or written instructions, or paraphrases, summaries or 
extracts from that advice. 


Using this categorisation he was able to go through the redacted documents and explain 
the basis, in respect of each, on which privilege was claimed. The same categorisation 
was adopted for the purposes of considering the witness statement material and the 
Powerhouse documents, but Mr Monson did abandon his claims to strike out the Level 1 
and 2 material from those statements and documents, which narrowed the scope of the 
debate (but not by much). 


The principal dispute between the parties was the extent to which the defendants could 
claim privilege in relation to the substance of communications between the client (in 
effect, the defendants) and a third party where what was communicated was, or referred 
to, privileged advice given to the client. Mr Monson's case was that the advice started out 
as privileged and it remained privileged notwithstanding its wider dissemination, as a 
result of two strands of authority. The first is The Good Luck [1992] 2 Lloyds Rep 540, 
which demonstrates that privileged material disseminated within the client company that 
obtained it is capable of retaining its privilege, but he seeks to apply it to show that 
privilege exists in documents communicated to a third party on the facts of this case. The 
second is Gotha City v Southeby's [1998] 1 WLR 114. That case is said to demonstrate 
that it is possible to disclose advice to an outsider without destroying or waiving the 
privilege which attaches to it other than as between the privilege owner and the third 
party. Those principles entitle the defendants to redact material which would otherwise 


10. 


11. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 9 of 30 


be disclosed. So far as restraining material which emanates from Powerhouse is 
concerned (the Powerhouse documents, Mr Turner's evidence and evidence from USP 
witnesses as to what Mr Turner told them at the time about legal advice) Mr Monson says 
that the defendants are entitled to restrain that on the footing that the material was and 
remained privileged, and its use ought to be restrained on principles to be gleaned from 
Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch 469 and Goddard v Nationwide Building Society 
[1987] QB 670. This applies whether or not Mr Turner, Mr Chan or Mr Borrill is giving 
evidence of it, or whether it is in documents revealed voluntarily by Powerhouse. So far 
as the Particulars of Claim go, the claim which attempts to base itself on this material 
must similarly be struck out as an abuse of the process. 

Mr Watson QC, for the claimants, comes at this from a slightly different angle. He 
obviously starts by accepting that there is privilege in the original advice from the Manx 
lawyers. He also accepts that it remains privileged while being passed within the client 
company, and he accepted that there would be common interest privilege where the 
advice was shared between the defendants. (This last concession makes it unnecessary for 
me to distinguish between the various defendants and enables me to treat the defendants 
as if they were one body for the purposes of considering the issues I have to decide). 
However, with the exception of a passing on of the advice verbatim and in whole, which 
he accepts remains privileged, he says that passing on summaries or parts of the advice to 
a third party does not amount to a privileged communication. This is because those 
communications do not fall within what he says are the requisite elements of privileged 
communications (which he extracts from the decision of Moore-Bick J in United States of 
America v Philip Morris & others, unreported, 10'" December 2003) because: 

a. They are not communications passing between lawyer and client — they are 
communications passing between client and a third party. 

b. They are not confidential, on the facts of this case. This means that the 
communications were not privileged, and if privilege might otherwise attach it has 
been waived. 

c. They were not for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice — the 
legal advice was conveyed as part of a sales pitch. 

Mr Watson goes on to submit that so far as Level 1 and Level 2 communications are 
concerned, they do not even contain a sufficient reference to advice to get a privilege case 
off the ground, and in any event there has been waiver of privilege because of material 
already deployed by the defendants in this litigation. Gotha is irrelevant, he says, because 
it is a case about waiver, and the question of whether a communication is privileged has 
to be answered first. So far as restraining the use of information that has already been 
obtained is concerned, he says that the principles to be extracted from Goddard and Lord 
Ashburton do not apply so as to restrain officers of the claimants giving evidence of what 
they were told in negotiations by Mr Turner, and Mr Turner should not be constrained 
from giving the evidence sought because his communications did not infringe any 
confidentiality rights of the defendants. He has various particular points on the wording 
which is sought to be excluded and in addition says that even if some of the material 
would otherwise be within an unwaived privilege, I should exercise my discretion not to 
strike it out, or otherwise restrain witnesses from giving evidence, because the defendants 
are using privilege to cover up wrong-doing (a sort of "clean hands" point), the claimants

were innocent recipients of the information from Powerhouse and there has been delay on 
the part of the defendants in making their application. 

In relation to this last point Mr Watson relies on an e-mail which has already, as a matter 
of form, already appeared in evidence in this case. He relies on this as showing not only 
that the defendants were or ought to have been aware of disclosures by Mr Turner as long 
ago as August 2001, when it was disclosed in this action as part of the disclosure process, 
but also in support of a proposition that much if not all of the position that the defendants 
seek to protect has been put in the public domain by the previous (and current) use of that 
e-mail. I need to set out this material. 

On 6" March 2000 Mr Chan, who it will be remembered is a director of the Claimant 
companies, wrote to Mr Turner in the course of his negotiations. Apparently, Mr Turner 
had asked for a copy of the Claimants' collection account agreement for the purpose of 
comparing it with the scheme proposed by the AON Group. He declined to supply it. The 
email observes that at that stage Mr Chan suspected that the Defendants had used "a draft 
prepared from our precedent". The sentence relied on by Mr Watson is a paragraph which 
reads as follows: 


"The solution promoted to you by AON and their advisors is that a Collections Account 
Agreement (sic) in the form of a trust will attain this and that therefore they have 
demonstrated the robustness required of them." 


(This, I would observe, is the passage that the defendants seek to have removed from the 
evidence, as referred to above. It will appear below that I am against redacting this 
material, so I am free to set it out in this judgment.) This email was annexed to a witness 
statement used by Mr Chan at the trial on liability. Mr Watson says that this email points 
to the fact that Mr Turner was saying things about legal advice, and that accordingly the 
Defendants have been aware of his disclosures, or the possibility of his disclosures, ever 
since the discovery process. So far as publicity is concerned, Mr Watson also relies on 
this email as demonstrating that the present position which the Claimants rely on in their 
particulars of claim is already in the public domain because the judge will be taken to 
have read this material at the trial, and it was formally part of Mr Chan's evidence on that 
occasion, although it does not appear that any specific reference was made to it at the 
trial. I shall deal with the significance, if any, of this email below. 


The legal principles involved 


One doctrine can be put on one side for the purposes of this judgment, and that is the 
doctrine of common interest privilege. I have already indicated that Mr Watson for his 
part accepted that common interest privilege existed as between the three defendant 
companies, so that communications of advice between the three of them attracted this 
form of privilege. Mr Monson for his part accepted that the doctrine did not operate as 
between the defendants on the one hand and Powerhouse on the other, because one of the 
tests which have to be fulfilled in order for joint privilege to exist is that the parties in 
question have to be capable of acting by the same solicitor in the matter in question, 
which requirement could not be fulfilled in the case of the defendants and Powerhouse.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 11 of 30 


It is therefore necessary to consider the extent to which privilege is maintained in 
material which is communicated to a third party by the client, which is the issue lying at 
the heart of these applications. This involves considering whether the communication was 
capable of being privileged, and if so whether the privilege has been waived. 

Mr Watson's submissions rely heavily on the effect of the Court of Appeal decision in 
Three Rivers District Council v The Governor & The Company of the Bank of England 
(no 7) [2003] EWCA Civ 474. He claims that that authority confines privilege to 
communications between solicitor and client, or vice versa. Communications with a third 
party fall outside that, because they do not fall within the description of communications 
between solicitor and client. While the case allows evidence of the contents of 
communications to attract privilege, that is limited to internal communications 
disseminating the information in question. Since the communication of advice to 
Powerhouse was not a solicitor/client communication, it cannot be privileged. 

I do not think that that is a correct application or analysis of the Three Rivers case. That 
case concerned not advice given by the solicitors, but preparations for the giving of 
instructions which were to lead to advice. In that context it was held that information 
gathered for that purpose was not within the privilege, because only communications 
were. But before too much is read into that, it must be born in mind that it concerns 
instructions, not advice. The Court of Appeal in that case did not have before it the extent 
to which the product of those instructions (the advice) was or was not communicated and 
what might happen to it thereafter, and care must be taken before taking the concept of 
"communication" too literally for these purposes. 

In my view, a correct reading of the case indicates that it does not support Mr Watson's 
proposition, and that reading is consistent with authority preceding Three Rivers. In 
paragraph 19 of his judgment Longmore LJ stated that "By the end of the nineteenth 
century it was, therefore, clear that legal advice privilege ... [applied] only to 
communications passing between [the] client and his solicitor (whether or not through 
any intermediary) and documents evidencing such communications" (my emphasis). A 
document evidencing the communication cannot be the communication itself, so 
Longmore LJ's formulation goes beyond the communication itself. Again, at paragraph 
21 he concludes that the 19" century authorities allowed privilege to "documents ... 
passing between the client and his legal advisers and evidence of the contents of such 
communications", (again, my emphasis) and went on to apply that principle. Again, 
therefore, records of communications were privileged. If emphasis be needed, it can be 
seen in the form of order made by the Court of Appeal, which is set out in a judgment of 
Tomlinson J in a later hearing in the same case ([2003] EWHC 2565 (Comm)) — the 
declaration as to privilege encompassed: 








"(1) Communications passing between the Bank and its legal advisers (including any 
solicitor seconded to the Bank) for the purposes of seeking or obtaining legal advice; 


(2) Any part of a document which evidences the substance of such a communication." 
That extended formulation would be capable of catching a number of things beyond the 


actual communication (oral or written) between solicitor and client, when applied to 
advice rather than instructions, all of which would be consistent with the policy 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 12 of 30 


underlying privilege and with a common sense application of that policy to the 
practicalities of everyday commercial life. 

a. First, it obviously applies to a letter of legal advice, or a letter containing legal 
advice. 

b. Second, it would cover the client's own written record of what his solicitor had 
told him orally. There is every reason why it should. 

c. Third, it would cover the situation where a client representative who obtains the 
advice passes that advice internally in the organisation in question. This would 
apply whether the advice is passed on verbatim or whether it is summarised or 
extracted. This is in line with The Good Luck, referred to above. In that case the 
relevant issue was whether or not breaches of duty by insurers were causative of a 
bank lending money to the owners of a vessel. The bank obtained some legal 
advice, and parts of the advice were disseminated internally so that the bank could 
decide whether to lend the money. It was submitted that the advice so extracted 
was not privileged because "such documents cannot be described (using the words 
of Lord Justice Taylor in Balabel v Air India) as part of that necessary exchange 
of information of which the object is the giving of legal advice as and when 
appropriate nor (again using the words of the Lord Justice) as documents made 
confidentially for the purposes of legal advice ...". That argument looks rather 
like an argument that only solicitor/client communications strictly so called can 
be privileged. Saville J rejected that argument. First, he pointed out that if the 
argument were right then in a great number of commercial cases the ability of a 
client to get legal advice in confidence (which underlay the doctrine of privilege) 
would be destroyed. He saw "no good reason or valid reason for the suggestion 
that the confidence which it is accepted attaches to the lawyer client 
communication itself, should somehow be lost once the advice is put to the 
commercial use for which it was sought in the first place". After pointing out that 
the logic of the argument he was rejecting would allow cross-examination of the 
officers of the client company about privileged advice, which would be a strange 
conclusion, he ended this section in his judgment by saying: 


"[The argument] is, in truth, based on the false premise that that which is 
communicated ceases to be a communication and thus loses the privilege 
attaching to lawyer-client communications." 


This last sentence is, perhaps (and with all due respect) a little dense. In The 
Sagheera [1997] 1 Lloyds Rep 160 at p 169 Rix J wondered whether it should not 
be understood in the sense "the false premise that that which is communicated 
internally ceases to be confidential" (his emphasis). Without wishing to pore over 
the sentence as if it were a statute, I think that it probably has a different meaning. 
I take it to mean that a record of a privileged communication has the same sort of 
quality as the communication itself for the purposes of privilege. In a literal sense 
a communication ceases to be that once it is communicated; but the law of 
privilege is not so blinkered as to regard privilege as attaching just to that event 
and to nothing else whatsoever. For privilege purposes a record of a 
communication is the same as the communication itself, and that is as true of 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 13 of 30 


summaries as of the verbatim original communication. That, I think, is what 
Savile J is saying. That formulation and reasoning recognises that something 
beyond the initial communication itself, strictly so called, is and should be within 
the privilege. It remains good law after Three Rivers, and is consistent with it. 


d. It would continue to cover cases such as Gotha City and the examples discussed 
in that case. In Gotha City, the apparent owner of a picture wished to sell it 
through Sothebys. It took advice from Messrs Herbert Smith (presumably relating 
to the sale, though the report does not say so) and sent a copy of the letter of 
advice to Sotheby's. Sotheby's also sat in on a meeting between the seller and 
Herbert Smith in respect of which an attendance note was produced. The plaintiff, 
who claimed to own the picture, sought inspection of the letter and attendance 
note. The argument was, in effect, about waiver of privilege, and it was held on 
the facts that there was no waiver. I shall return to that in the context of the 
present case. For the moment it should be noted that privilege was assumed to 
exist in both documents; it was not argued that the copy letter sent to Sotheby's 
was not a privileged communication. If Mr Watson's argument were correct then 
logically it ought not to be, subject to his distinction between verbatim content 
(privileged) and summarising content (not privileged); yet the argument did not 
occur to anyone in that case. In fact, it is quite clear that Staughton LJ had no 
difficulty with the concept of preserving privilege in privileged advice 
notwithstanding that it was communicated by the client to the third party, because 
at page 119 he cited, obviously with approval, a passage from Style & Hollander 
on Documentary Evidence: 


"If A shows a privileged document to his six best friends, he will not be able to 
assert privilege if one of the friends sues him because the document is not 
confidential as between him and the friend. But the fact six other people have 
seen it does not prevent him claiming privilege as against the rest of the world." 


I think that it follows from that that A would be able to restrain each of the friends 
from disclosing to the outside world what they were told on the basis that it 
remained privileged. The friends could not give secondary evidence of the 
privileged material — it would be "evidence of [privileged] communications", or 
their evidence would be "evidencing such communications" within the 
formulation in Three Rivers. By the same token, if a client summarises or extracts 
advice in a letter to a third party, that written communication is capable of 
retaining or attracting the privilege which attached to the original advice, subject 
to waiver. It, too, is something which evidences a privileged communication. 


e. This analysis gives rise to a regime which maintains intellectual consistency and 
maintains the policy underlying privilege, which is that a man is entitled to make 
a clean breast of matters to his lawyers without fear of disclosure, a policy which 
covers both the giving of instructions and the receiving of advice. It means that a 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 14 of 30 


client can reproduce the advice for his own purposes without necessarily risking 
that reproduction not being privileged, which in my view is essential to the 
sensible operation of the doctrine. It also means that he can discuss the advice 
with others without necessarily risking the same thing. A client may well wish to 
discuss advice received with a partner, or with another adviser, or (as in Gotha 
City) with a contractual counterparty who might be affected. The effect of 
privilege would be seriously dented if those communications were held to be not 
privileged so that, if evidence of them could be obtained, an insight as to the 
advice would become available. That is not a sensible result. 


20. The position therefore seems to me to be as follows. Where privileged advice is disclosed 


21. 


to a third party the privilege is capable of attaching to the third party communication 
because that communication is evidence of the privileged advice within the formulation 
in Three Rivers. It does not matter whether that third party communication is of the whole 
of the advice (like the letter in Herbert Smith) or a paraphrase of or extract from the 
advice. To be fair to Mr Watson, he conceded that privilege would be maintained in 
relation to actual full copies of written advice obtained, so that in the present case he did 
not press for inspection of one document, or part of a document, which (on the evidence) 
is a straight reproduction, or forwarding, of the Manx legal advice verbatim. However, he 
sought to distinguish between the complete advice and summaries, extracts or 
paraphrases. Those, he said, were not privileged. The only justifications he was able to 
advance for this distinction were first that the paraphrases were not the original 
communication, and second that there was a potential for inaccuracy in any summary or 
paraphrase. Any inaccurate summary would not be the original advice. These 
submissions are not convincing. If it is right that the original verbatim advice remains 
privileged, then it is illogical to exclude paraphrases or parts of it. If 100% is privileged, 
then would communicating 99% of it remain privileged? — it is hard to see why not. But 
if that is right, then why not 90%, or 75%, or 50%? There is no reason to draw a line 
anywhere, and every reason not to. Mr Watson's demarcation would also, in practice, 
mean that any passing on of oral advice would be likely to be unprivileged, because it is 
most unlikely that it would be passed on in whole and verbatim. That, again, is an 
unmeritorious distinction. The proper analysis, consistent with Three Rivers, is to 
continue to afford privilege to material which evidences or reveals the substance of legal 
advice (subject, of course, to waiver). The possibility of inaccuracy is not a reason for 
departing from this principle. If the passed on "advice" were so inaccurate that it could no 
longer be properly described as a summary of the advice, then it might be that that 
communication would not be privileged (though even then it might attract privilege if it 
tended to reveal instructions given, which it might well), but there is no suggestion that 
that is the case here and I need not consider it further. Short of that, I do not see why 
some degree of inaccuracy, even if it exists, should necessarily destroy the privilege; so 
there is all the more reason for saying that the possibility of inaccuracy should not 
destroy the privilege which would otherwise exist in paraphrases or summaries. 

This means that the subsistence or otherwise of privilege, where advice is communicated 
to a third party, turns on the extent to which there is a waiver of privilege on that 
occasion. Gotha City demonstrates that it is not inevitable that there is a waiver in those 
circumstances. In that case it was held that the receipt of the advice by Sotheby's was 
attended by a degree of confidentiality which meant that, while there was waiver as

24. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 15 of 30 


between the owner and Sotheby's, there was no waiver vis-a-vis the outside world. The 
question in the present case, therefore, is whether and to what extent there was a waiver. I 
consider the application of these principles to the facts of this case below. 

In these proceedings the question was raised whether the Level 1 and Level 2 references 
were capable of being privileged. This raises (in theory) the question of whether, after 
Three Rivers and its emphasis on privilege attaching only to communications, there can 
be privilege attaching to evidence of the fact of instructing solicitors or getting advice 
from them (Level 1), or to evidence of the fact of instructing solicitors and getting advice 
on a particular subject (Level 2) because those facts are not communications or evidence 
of communications. I do not propose to consider this as a matter of principle, because on 
the facts of this case there has been a plain waiver even if there was privilege. 

The next question of law which arises is the extent to which a party entitled to an 
unwaived privilege is entitled to restrain those in possession of the information from 
disclosing it or otherwise making use of it. It arises in this case if and insofar as Mr 
Turner received privileged information in confidence and then disclosed it to 
representatives of the claimants, if and insofar as Powerhouse has disclosed documents 
which contain unwaived privileged material. It is accepted by both sides that this material 
contains some Level 3 documents, though they do not always entirely agree as to which 
pieces of evidence fall into that category. 

There is not much disagreement between the parties as to the principles applicable in this 
area, although there is serious disagreement as to how they should be applied. It is 
sufficient for these purposes to refer to only two authorities. The first is Goddard v 
Nationwide Building Society [1987] Q.B. 670. In that case the Court of Appeal was asked 
to consider whether or not to restrain the use of a note, containing privileged information, 
which a solicitor, who had at one stage been acting for both the plaintiff and defendant, 
had passed to the defendant. Privilege in the material contained in the note was held to 
belong to the Plaintiff. Having determined that, the Court of Appeal granted relief 
restraining use of the material contained in that note, which relief included striking out 
allegations in the pleading which were based on that note, an injunction restraining the 
Defendant from relying upon the note and orders for delivery up of all copies. In his 
leading judgment May L.J. considered the case of Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch. 
469 and another authority, and pronounced the following proposition (at page 683): 


"If a litigant has in his possession copies of documents to which legal professional 
privilege attaches he may nevertheless use such copies as secondary evidence in his 
litigation: however, if he has not yet used the documents in that way, the mere fact that he 
intends to do so is no answer to a claim against him by the person in whom the privilege 
is vested for delivery up of the copies or to restrain them from disclosing or making any 
use of any information contained in them." 


His citation of authority indicates, I think, that he considered that he would normally 
expect the restraint to be ordered. That last point is rather clearer in the judgment or 
Nourse L.J. He made the following points, relevant to this application: 


2m; 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 16 of 30 


"The crucial point is that the party who desires the protection must seek it before the 
other party has adduced the confidential communication in evidence or otherwise relied 
on it at trial. 


".,. Although the equitable jurisdiction [that is to say, the jurisdiction to restrain the 
misuse of confidential information] is of much wider application, I have little doubt that 
it can prevail over the rule of evidence [viz the rule of evidence which allows secondary 
evidence to be given of primary material where the latter is privileged] only in cases 
where privilege can be claimed ... 


"Once it is established that a case is governed by Lord Ashburton v Pape, there is no 
discretion in the court to refuse to exercise the equitable jurisdiction according to its view 
of materiality of the communication, the justice of admitting or excluding it or the like. 
The injunction is granted in aid of privilege which, unless and until it is waived, is 
absolute. In saying this I do not intend to suggest that there may not be cases where an 
injunction can properly be refused on general principles affecting the grant of a discretion 
remedy, for example on the ground of inordinate delay." 


From this it is clear that not only does the court have jurisdiction to grant appropriate 
relief to prevent reliance upon privileged material where privilege has not been waived, 
the starting point is that one would expect that relief to be granted. That was certainly the 
view of Lawrence Collins J in the second relevant authority, STIL Group Inc. v Zahoor 
[2003] 2 All E.R. 252. At paragraph 91 of that judgment (at page 273) he observed that 
"in such cases the court should 'ordinarily' intervene". The court is "not concerned with 
weighing the materiality of the document and the justice of admitting it". (Paragraph 92). 
He went on to say this: 


"93 Fifth, there is nothing in the authorities which would prevent the application of the 
rule that confidentiality is subject to the public interest. In this context, the emergence of 
the truth is not of itself of sufficient public interest. The reason why the balancing 
exercise is not appropriate is because the balance between privilege and truth has already 
been struck in favour of the former by the establishment of the rules concerning legal 
professional privilege. 


"94 Sixth, other public interest factors may still apply. So there is no reason in principle 
why the court should not apply the rule that the court will not restrain publication of 
material in relation to misconduct of such a nature that it ought in the public interest to be 
disclosed to others... there is no confidence as to the disclosure of iniquity. But the 
defence of public interest is not limited to iniquity." 


He went on to hold that on the facts of his particular case, the public interest in the proper 
administration of justice meant that equitable relief, which would otherwise be granted to 
preserve the confidentiality in the privilege material, should not be granted. The facts of

28. 


29,

that case were very strong. They involved a clear forgery, and the apparent possibility of 
the court actually being misled by the proposed evidence. 


I therefore approach this point on the footing that the normal starting point would be for 
appropriate relief to be granted to restrain the use of privileged material. So far as I have 
a discretion to do otherwise, it is not to be exercised merely on the footing that if I do not 
exercise it, the truth is more likely to come out. There must be some other factors, such as 
delay, acquiescence or other equitable defences which must be sufficiently strong to 
override the normal, very strong principle, that privileged communications are protected 
from disclosure. I shall consider the application of these principles to the facts of the case 
before me in a separate section of this judgment below. 


The application of the law to the facts 


It follows from the above that, subject to waiver, communications by the Defendants to 
Powerhouse which contain or refer to the content of legal advice are capable of being 
privileged. This includes Level 3 communications. Whether or not it includes Level 1 and 
Level 2 communications I do not have to decide, because on any footing there has been a 
waiver of such privilege as might otherwise have existed in those references. At the trial 
on liability Mr Mian gave evidence. That evidence included his dealings with Mr Turner 
of Powerhouse. Having referred to the opening stages of the negotiation, when Mr Mian 
was trying to convince Mr Turner that he had an appealing scheme, he then said the 
following: 


"13 Stuart Turner wanted confirmation of a protected trust account. At this stage I sought 
advice from our lawyers and then passed on this advice to Stuart. This was in late 
February 2000. I wish to make it clear that I am not waiving the privilege that attaches 
these communications." 


Since that is a clear indication both that solicitors were instructed and as to the subject 
matter of the instructions, I do not see how it can conceivably be argued that similar 
references, containing the same information, in documents or otherwise can have 
maintained any privilege if, indeed, it ever had any. To the same effect is the extract from 
the letter from Mr de Freitas, which I have quoted from above. I expect that both those 
references occurred because it never occurred to the Defendant that, in the context of this 
case, the fact that legal advice was obtained on this transaction was, in itself, in the least 
bit confidential. If that were right then it would mean that documents containing a 
reference to such limited matters would not have the necessary confidentiality to attract 
privilege in the first place, and my first instinct is that such references would not in any 
event, as a matter of principle, be privileged. However, as I have indicated above, I do 
not need to decide that in this case. I can and do deal with the point as a matter of waiver. 
In fairness to Mr Monson, I should record that he did not press privilege in relation to 
these matters particularly strongly. His main concern was that leaving them in the 
documents might amount to a waiver. 

That leaves the level 3 communications. These are communications which somehow 
reveal the content of the advice that was obtained. Despite the fact this was contained in 


30. 


ol, 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 18 of 30 


communications with a third party (Powerhouse), on the reasoning set out above, and 
unless waived, that privilege can be maintained. The question therefore arises whether or 
not there was a waiver when the material was conveyed to Powerhouse, and in particular 
to Mr Turner. The Gotha City case demonstrates that privileged matters can be conveyed 
to a third party in circumstances which limit the extent of the waiver. I consider that that 
was the case here. I have already set out the terms of the confidentiality agreement which 
operated between the Defendants and Powerhouse. Mr Watson submitted that it did not 
apply to legal advice, but only to such matters as know-how and trade secrets. I do not 
think that that submission is right. The expression "Confidential Information" is not 
defined in the agreement — the wording says what the expression includes but not what it 
means. That being the case, I have to consider what the expression actually does mean, 
particularly in its context. The very use of the word "confidential" connotes information 
with a degree of confidentiality, and it seems to me that legal advice is something that is 
likely to fall fairly and squarely within that concept. On 16" September 2003 Mr Turner 
signed a witness statement in which he conceded that the Defendants had asked him to 
keep the actual advice received from the lawyers, and forwarded to him, confidential. 
Indeed, confidentiality in the actual advice is in effect conceded by Mr Watson, although 
not in terms, when he concedes that he is not entitled to see the verbatim version of the 
advice which was forwarded to Powerhouse. In his witness statement Mr Turner states 
that he did not consider that more general statements as to the nature or the effect of the 
advice (the nature of which I had seen in some of the material that I am invited to strike 
out of witness statements) was confidential, but in my view he is wrong about that. It 
follows, then, that the advice retained its privileged character and any waiver of privilege 
was limited to Powerhouse, and the use to which it could be put was limited by the terms 
of the confidentiality agreement. The terms of that agreement permit only a very limited 
use. Accordingly, conveying the lawyers' advice to Mr Turner and Powerhouse, under 
those terms of confidentiality, did not destroy the confidential nature of the advice, and 
therefore any waiver of privilege was limited to Powerhouse and was not general. 

Those conclusions can be summarised in relation to the redactions which have been made 
in the Defendants’ disclosed documents is as follows: 


(a) References to the mere obtaining of legal advice are not privileged. 


(b) References to the obtaining of legal advice on a given subject matter are not 
privileged. 


(c) Level 3 references, which evidence the content of that advice, are prima facie 
privileged. 


I add one small point which arises in another context in this case and which may or may 
not arise in relation to the redacted material. The Defendants have shown some sensitivity 
as to the identification of the lawyers concerned. Some of the documents which I have to 
come on to consider later on in this judgment actually identify the Manx lawyers. In the 
light of the conclusion that I have come to in relation to Levels 1 and 2, I do not think 
that the identity of the lawyers involved is capable of attracting privilege either.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 19 of 30 


That brings me to the material which the Defendants wish to have struck out of the 
documents voluntarily disclosed by Powerhouse, and various witness statements. I will 
take the witness statement material first. 

Some of the disputed material is no longer in issue in the light of Mr Monson's 
concession that he does not seek to strike out Level 1 and Level 2 material from the 
witness statements. That leaves it for me to consider what to do about what is said to be 
Level 3 material. So far as there is any such reference, this is made in two ways. First, 
there is a witness statement from Mr Turner in which he describes what he obtained from 
the AON Group in the course of the negotiations, which is said to include some Level 3 
material; and second there is some material in witness statements of Mr Borrill and Mr 
Chan in which they reproduce what Mr Turner told them at the time of the negotiations, 
which is itself said to include some Level 3 disclosure. What is said by Mr Monson on 
behalf of the Defendants is that Mr Turner was not entitled to disclose the advice of the 
Manx lawyers to the Plaintiffs' negotiators, and it remained privileged and confidential. 
Privilege has not been waived, and in accordance with the "ordinary course" relief should 
be granted to make sure that that material is not deployed. He has applied in time. 

To this analysis Mr Watson had a number of ripostes. They were (although not in the 
same order as he advanced them) as follows: 

a. On the facts, Mr Turner was at liberty to disclose what was disclosed to him 
within what was allowed to him by the confidentiality agreement. This 
distinguishes the present case from the other authorities where the disclosee was 
not similarly at liberty. I do not agree with this. Since it was confidential, he was 
not at liberty to disclose it — see above. 

b. The blatant aim of the Defendants in seeking to have parts of the witness 
statements excised and to have the witness barred from giving evidence of the 
excised contents was to hide a wrongdoing, so the discretion of the court should 
not be exercised in favour of the Defendants. Again, I think this begs the question. 
Whether or not there was a wrongdoing at the end of February 2000 is precisely 
the question the court will have to decide on the enquiry. Even in a case where the 
sole evidence of wrongdoing is in a privileged communication, that does not 
justify the court in exercising its discretion against the invocation of the privilege. 
By and large, a party can only prove what he or she can prove without the aid of 
the other side's privileged material. 

c. So far as the evidence of the Claimants' own officers is concerned they wish to 
give evidence of material that came into their possession without any wrongdoing 
on their part. That, said Mr Watson, is a reason for not restraining their use of that 
information. However, I do not think that that is a determining, or even a strong, 
factor. The converse may well be true — wrongdoing on the part of the recipient 
may strengthen a claim for relief - but it does not follow that the absence of 
wrongdoing means that an injunction should not be granted. I note that in 
Goddard there was no suggestion that the Defendant was guilty of wrongdoing in 
obtaining the privileged information from the solicitor. The solicitor was, of 
course, technically guilty of breaching the Plaintiff's confidentiality, but by the 
same token, on the facts of this case, so was Mr Turner. 

d. Ifthe Level 3 material, such as it is, were excised from the witness statements of 
Mr Borrill and Mr Chan, then they would not be able to give full and frank 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 20 of 30 


evidence of what had actually happened and what their motivation was. Their 
evidence will be that they received certain information and encouragement from 
Mr Turner and they adjusted their conduct accordingly. If they are not allowed to 
give their full evidence then their evidence will have an air of artificiality about it, 
or even potentially a misleading quality. I am rather more troubled about this. 
They did what they did, and they relied on what they relied on. To prevent them 
from telling the court what they actually relied on in reaching their conclusions as 
to pricing, when that is an issue which lies at that heart of the enquiry as to 
damages, would be a very strong thing. However, I think that the answer to this 
problem may be a practical one. I do not consider that their case will be harmed if 
they are allowed to give evidence (which it seems to me they must be) that they 
relied on what they had been told about the advice given by the Manx lawyers 
without actually identifying precisely what it was that they were told. What lies at 
the heart of the causation question on this part of the enquiry is not the advice 
given by Manx lawyers but whether or not an infringing copy of the CAA had 
been made. That is a different, though related, question. I do not think that the 
proper conduct of the enquiry will be effected if the evidence were limited in that 
way; it is not necessary for them to go further and state what the advice was, and 
on my findings they are not entitled to anyway. It not infrequently happens in a 
trial that a witness states that "as a result of the legal advice received, I did X", 
and it is well understood that in those circumstances the witness does not have to 
give evidence of what the advice was. This is therefore not a reason for departing 
from the normal course. On the facts of this particular case, if the Defendants 
were in fact to challenge that sort of evidence as to causation, then they might 
well risk the fact that the witness would be able to justify the statement by 
amplifying what he had understood the advice received by the Defendants to have 
been, but that is a risk for the Defendants to assess, and whether or not the matter 
is opened up would be a matter for the Master at the enquiry. 

e. Next Mr Watson submitted that since privilege was waived vis-a-vis Mr Turner, 
even if it was not waived vis-a-vis the rest of the world, Mr Turner was free to use 
the rest of the information disclosed to him in legal proceedings. I am not sure 
that Mr Watson was prepared to press this submission very strongly, but in any 
event it is wrong. The use to which Mr Turner was entitled to put the privileged 
material was governed by the Confidentiality Agreement, and, as the extracts set 
out above demonstrate, that use was strictly limited. It did not include disclosing 
legal advice to competitors, whether for use as a bargaining counter or not. 

f. Next, Mr Watson said that in effect the material had been deployed, so it was too 
late to be prevent its further deployment — see Goddard. The privileged material 
had already been deployed because of the Chan e-mail referred to above, so the 
defendants are too late. Since this email was part of the documentation at the trial, 
and should be taken to have been read by the trial judge (even though no one says 
that it played any material part in the trial), the matter has already been given a 
form of publicity which means it has been deployed, so it is too late to prevent 
evidence of other disclosures of the same sort of material. Related to this is a 
laches point. He says that the fact that Mr Turner had made disclosures of the 
advice given would have been apparent to the Defendants on disclosure in the 


a0. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 21 of 30 


main action, which took place on 24" August 2001 when the defendants would 
have seen the Chan e-mail. Its wording, it will be remembered, contained the 
following paragraph. 


"The solution promoted to you by AON and their advisors is that a Collections Account 
Agreement [sic] in the form of a trust will attain this and that therefore they will have 
demonstrated the robustness required of them. You are now seeking counsels advice on 
the proposed trust." 


This, says Mr Watson, should have alerted the Defendants to the fact that the Claimants 
had found out that legal advice had been obtained on the Defendants proposed 
transactions, and I infer that Mr Watson would say that they should have inferred that Mr 
Turner was the source of this information. They should therefore have inferred at that 
stage that privilege information had been crossing the divide; and since about two years 
elapsed before the Defendants took any point on the alleged wrongful disclosure of 
privileged information, it was by then too late for them to do so. Mr Monson's response 
to this is that in the context of the claim made at the trial, when there was no suggestion 
that a claim of infringement of copyright was being made as early as the end of February, 
this passage had no great significance. He also said that the oral evidence of Mr Borrill at 
the trial as to the infringement of copyright contained no suggestion that the relevant date 
was being put as early as this. Since the email did not actually figure at the trial, and even 
though it was in trial bundles, that did not mean that the whole question of the legal 
advice given at the time had been sufficiently aired in public so as to amount to 
deployment of the material and so as to make it wrong to restrain its further being aired 
now. Since the point now in issue was not then in play, it is not surprising that the 
significance of this email passage was overlooked, and the fact that it was overlooked 
should now not be held against the Defendants now that the focus of the case had shifted, 
or a little more precisely now that the case had acquired a second point of focus to which 
it had become relevant. In my view Mr Monson is right. I do not think that this single 
sentence, in the circumstances, amounts to deployment of the other material. It does not 
amount to an airing of the other privileged material, so it does not give it a relevant 
degree of publicity to mean that the defendants are now too late. So far as laches is 
concerned, in the light of the absence of any significance of that piece of evidence at the 
trial, and in the light of the fact that the pre-1“ March infringement claim only came after 
the trial, I think it would be unfair on the Defendants to say that they are too late because 
the material has been deployed, and that in general laches terms they should have taken 
the point (so far as they have one) any earlier than they did. 


My conclusion on this point is that, if there is Level 3 material relating to privileged 
matter, then there are no factors of any real weight which would lead me to take anything 
other than the ordinary course which is to exclude such matter. I therefore have to go on 
to consider how much of the material falls into that category. In this context, I shall take 
the various passages which the Defendants say infringe their privilege in turn. Where I 
come to the conclusion that a matter is revealed in breach of privilege, I will not actually 
set out the material. 

i. Borrill Fourth Witness Statement paragraph 25 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 22 of 30 


ill. 


Two sentences are sought to be excised in order, in effect to prevent Mr 
Borrill giving indirect evidence of material passed to him in breach of 
privilege and in breach of confidence. The first sentence refers to legal 
advice, the firm from which it was obtained, (by inference and in its 
context) the subject matter to which it related, and a very short expression 
summarising the advice it given. The last of those elements is 
objectionable; the first three are not. The sentence as it stands ought to be 
struck out, but I can see no objection to a replacement sentence which 
gives the first three elements and otherwise refers to the advice without 
stating what it was. The second sentence describes how he had got the 
advice ("this advice had been forwarded by LGH to Stuart Turner"). This 
sentence is unobjectionable. 


Borrill Fourth Witness Statement paragraph 26 


The words objected to are words in which Mr Turner is recorded as having 
passed on to Mr Borrill the view of the Manx lawyers as to the workability 
of the Defendants' proposals. Again, this is material said to come from Mr 
Turner; and again, it was imparted by the latter in breach of his duty of 
confidence by way of infringing the Defendants' privilege. The words as 
they stand ought to be struck out because the court ought not to receive 
evidence of privileged matter obtained in this way. 


Stuart Turner First Witness Statement paragraph 22 


In this paragraph Mr Turner narrates part of the history of his dealings 
with Mr Mian. The first sentence describes the instruction of the Manx 
lawyers to advise on the Defendants' scheme structure. It is not 
objectionable. The first half of the second sentence refers to the fact that 
on 22" February he saw the advice provided by those lawyers (Cains). 
That, as it stands, again seems to me to be unobjectionable. It does not 
reveal the contents of that advice. The second half of that sentence 
contains a reference to a document referred to in the advice which it goes 
on to describe it in a certain way. The third sentence contains a further 
description of the document just referred to. There is no statement as to 
what the advice actually was. The paragraph then goes on "I was asked by 
AON to keep the Cains' advice confidential. I told Mr Mian on that day 
that the advice did not really address my particular concerns and that I 
would need to see a copy of [a particular document, just referred to] in 
order to know whether it protected customers' money. He said that he 
would have to clear this with AON and AON Legal, and that he would 
have to delete the existing client names from the document; but subject to 
that he agreed to provide a copy." The last sentences that I have quoted do 
not disclose the advice, and this part of the evidence does not contravene 
Mr Turner's obligation of confidentiality apart from the implicit cross- 
reference back. They are unobjectionable, apart from that. The 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 23 of 30

Vi. 


immediately preceding elements, which I have not yet dealt with, present a 
little more difficulty. One could argue that where a third party, who is 
within the privilege, merely mentions the fact that a privileged 
communication refers to a given document is not an infringement of 
privilege because it is not disclosing information which tends to indicate 
what the advice was. However, I do not think that is right. The question is 
whether a communication is privileged. To the extent that it is, production 
or proof of it cannot be compelled or allowed. It is not appropriate to 
dissect very small elements out of it and say that disclosure of small 
elements is not an infringement of privilege. It is either privileged or not, 
and if it is it is wrong to allow Mr Turner to give evidence of its content. 
In any event, in relation to the references in this particular case, it could be 
argued that what Mr Turner says might reveal what instructions were 
given to the lawyers, and those instructions are as privileged as the advice. 
Accordingly, I consider that Mr Turner is not entitled to refer to, and give 
evidence of, the content of this advice so far as it contains a description of 
a document referred to within it. Those parts of paragraph 22 will have to 
be struck out. The remaining sentences will have to be modified so that 
they do not cross-refer to a document referred to in privileged advice. He 
would be entitled to give evidence that he asked for a copy of a document, 
but not in such a way to suggest that the advice referred to it. I accept that 
this tends to have an air of unreality or artificiality about it, but that is the 
position at which one sometimes arrives when a witness is required to 
skate delicately around the edge of privileged communications. 


Turner First Witness Statement paragraph 23 — last sentence 

In this sentence, Mr Turner refers to the fact of receiving further advice 
from Cains via Mr Mian, and goes on to indicate something that it 
mentions. The first part of that sentence is permissible; the second part is 
not because it reveals an element of a privileged communications. 
Turner First Witness Statement paragraph 25 

This contains a statement which is quite clearly a Level 2 Statement. Mr 
Monson does not pursue the excision of this sentence, and in any event I 


would not have required its removal. 


Chan Second Witness Statement paragraph 5 


This paragraph seeks to give evidence of a conversation that he had with Mr Turner 
during the negotiations. The objected to part reads: 


"However, he [i.e. Mr Turner] told me on the phone that AON and their advisors, Cains, 
had nonetheless demonstrated that their scheme was sufficiently robust for the purposes 


36. 


gis 


38. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 24 of 30 


of Powerhouse, by describing how their collections account agreement would ring fence 
customer monies in the scheme." 


I am not prepared to order the excision of this part of the witness statement. It would be 
unobjectionable without the words "and their advisors, Cains", but it would also have a 
slight air of falsity about it if Mr Turner in fact referred to them. I do not consider that a 
reference such as that contravenes privilege in any particular communication by revealing 
its content. 


Next I have to deal with Mr Monson's claim that I should order the redaction of certain 
parts of two documents emanating from Powerhouse. The first is a memo from Mr 
Turner to Mr Broomfield and Mr Stanley, two of his colleagues in Powerhouse. It refers 
to the competing bids, and compares various aspects of them. Under the heading "AON" 
it contains first an innocuous sentence stating that the concern that Powerhouse had was 
to ring fence service fees and that that concern has yet to be satisfactorily resolved. There 
is then a sentence which states what the "initial indications" from Cains are. That 
sentence seems to summarise the advice of that firm, and as such it contains a reference 
to privileged information and ought to be redacted. The second sentence is equivocal in 
that it refers to a suggestion which might or might not have been contained in Cains 
advice. Mr Monson tells me on instructions that he and Mr de Frietas have checked 
whether or not it does reflect advice, and he tells me that it does. On that footing, it falls 
to be redacted as does the first sentence. The document then goes on, in a separate 
paragraph, to state as follows: 


"We need to take into account that no precedent (as at the date of this memo) has been set 
in law, and therefore no proof exists to prove that the trust solution presented to 
Powerhouse by AON would have any legal weight. It would seem only wise to secure 
further independent legal advice." 


I do not see how a case can be made for excising this material and in the end Mr Monson 
did not press for the redaction. 

The second Powerhouse document is an undated document which was generated 
internally so that someone could consider the various proposals that were before it. On 
page 2, under the heading "The Issue" it contains wording that is identical to that which I 
have just considered. That wording should be treated similarly. There is one additional 
sentence under the heading "The Question", and it reads as follows: 


"Powerhouse have read the Cains response (attached) with some interest but are 
concerned that they seem to have "skated around" the core issue for Powerhouse." 


The Cains response referred to is not disclosed. This sentence is objected to, but I cannot 
really see why. It certainly does not contain any evidence of what the Cains advice was. 
There is nothing objectionable about it.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 25 of 30 


The last document is the Chan email that I have referred to above. I am not prepared to 
order the excision of this part of the evidence. It is no more objectionable than paragraph 
5 of his witness statement, which I have already declined to excise. 

Next I turn to the particulars of claim in the enquiry. Mr Monson says I should strike out 
certain allegations made in the Particulars of Claim because they were only able to be 
made because of unauthorised disclosure by Mr Turner. In effect, he invites me to take 
the same approach in relation to this statement of case as the Court of Appeal took to the 
relevant pleading in the Goddard case. Some of the objected to parts correspond to parts 
of witness statements which I have allowed to stand in that they refer merely to the 
receipt and transmission of legal advice. However, two sentences go further and refer to 
the content of legal advice, in a similar manner to parts of Mr Turner's witness statement 
which I have ordered should be excised. I was at first tempted to accede to Mr Monson's 
application to strike out at least those limited parts. However, I have decided I should not 
do so. Now that the position as to admissible evidence has (I hope) become clearer as a 
result of this judgment, Mr Watson may well wish to reconsider how he is going to make 
his case, since part of his submissions to me involve assertions that he could get to where 
he wanted through different routes in any event. If he is right about that then he may wish 
to consider re-pleading. I do not think it is necessary, in that context, for me to start 
striking out parts of the existing statement of case. If Mr Watson has no other way of 
getting to where he wants apart from relying on evidence that I have required to be 
removed, then he will not be able to make good the allegations in the Particulars of 
Claim. No harm is done by leaving them in. If he thinks he can get there through another 
route, then he should be at liberty to do so. It may be that in fact he may wish to 
reconsider how he puts his case and remove or amend certain parts of the present claim. 
That is obviously a matter for him. At the moment I think the most sensible course is to 
leave the particulars of claim where they are. 


Apollo Transaction 
In his judgment on the trial of liability, Judge Weeks Q.C. observed: 


"I suspect that in the morass of documents the parties may have lost sight of their 
commercial interests and the purpose of litigation". 


In some ways I cannot help sharing that view in relation to this section of the application 
before me. I find it difficult to see that the events to which I now have to refer can give 
rise to any particular material claim, and I cannot help thinking that what I shall call the 
Apollo claim is a storm in a teacup, and Mr Watson at one stage was disposed to accept 
that that was an accurate description of at least part of the dispute in relation to this 
matter. However, it is a matter which is raised in the enquiry as to damages, and there has 
been no attempt to strike it out on the basis that it is frivolous or otherwise that it should 
not be dealt with, so I am forced to deal with it. 

In 1999 the AON Group entered into a warranty support scheme with a concern that can 
be described as Apollo. It is common ground that this scheme was not a trust-based 


4A. 


45. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 26 of 30 


scheme so documents of the nature of the CAA played no part in it in its final form. 
Furthermore, there is no suggestion that the Claimants were in competition with the 
Defendants for that scheme, so there is no suggestion that they have suffered direct 
financial loss because the Defendants got the contract. However, the allegation is that in 
the course of considering the Apollo transaction, consideration was given at some stage 
to a trust-based scheme to which the CAA would have been appropriate, and that in that 
context there was some copying of the Scottish Power CAA or otherwise some 
infringement of the claimants' rights in respect to it. There is evidence for supposing that 
the CAA was considered in the context of the Apollo scheme, because the infringing 
copy forwarded to Powerhouse had originally been saved on the Defendants' computer 
systems under a file name whose path included something which appears to be a 
directory designated to "Apollo 2000". The case of the claimants, as described to me by 
Mr Watson, was that if there was some copying in this context, even if (as seems clearly 
to be the case) the copies were in no way deployed in the actual Apollo Scheme, the 
Defendants are liable to pay a payment in the nature of a royalty. They therefore seek 
disclosure of all drafts of the CAA prepared for the purpose of the Apollo transactions, 
and they also seek all memoranda and similar notes referring to any such documents. 
The disclosure sought by the Claimants is in terms as follows: 


"All drafts of the collections account agreement or equivalent agreement (in both 
electronic and hard copy form) which have been prepared, used or intended to be used by 
the Defendants or any of them for the purposes of putting into effect the warranty scheme 
for: 


[Apollo]; 
Any other Retailer 


All memoranda, attendance notes, board minutes and correspondence (including emails) 
which refer to any document referred to in [the preceding paragraph] (including internal 
documents prepared by the Defendants' and documents passing between any two or more 
the Defendants)." 


Mr Monson accepted that his clients were under an obligation to disclose documents 
relating to the use of the CAA in Apollo but said that they have already been disclosed 
(and the Claimants have been given copies,) apart from such privileged documents as 
may exist. I should say at this stage that in case there is any daylight between Mr 
Monson's concession and formulation of the category of documents sought by the 
Claimants, I would make an order in those terms, but I do not think that there would be 
much debate about that. The debate in this area centred around the question of privilege. 
Paragraph 17 of the particulars of claim in the enquiry states that: 


"It is to be inferred from [certain pleaded material] that the first and/or second Defendant 
also copied the CAA for the purpose of sending it and/or sent it to Apollo 2000." 


46. 


47. 


48. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 27 of 30 


It does not appear that a copy of any document specifically created at this stage has been 
disclosed, whether as a document that the defendants have in their possession or as a 
document which they once had. Mr Watson seeks to make a case that CAA must at some 
stage have been copied for the purpose of considering whether or not to deploy it in a 
scheme for Apollo, even if it never was so used, and even if a copy was never sent to 
Apollo, and the suggestion is that such a document was, or may have been, sent to the 
defendants solicitors. The debate before me was principally about privilege. Various 
documents were debated, each of them hypothetical - they were hypothetical because the 
Defendants deliberately said nothing about the existence or non-existence of such 
documents because if they had then they would or might be admitting that which they 
claim they were entitled to decline to admit (because of privilege), and I suspect they 
were also concerned about waiver of privilege. Those documents were as follows: 
i. | Copies of the CAA prepared for the purposes of being submitted to 
solicitors for their consideration. 
ii. Any amended CAA arising as a result of work by the solicitors. 
ili. | Versions of the CAA thus amended and put back in the hands of the 
Defendants or any of them. 
Mr Watson's final position in argument was that such documents could not be privileged. 
Those described under (i) would simply be copies of an unprivileged document, and 
would not be privileged because of the Three Rivers case. Next he said that documents in 
category (11) would not be privileged because once the to-ing and fro-ing on advice had 
been concluded it no longer formed part of the advice. So far as the drafts back in the 
hands of the clients were concerned (category (iii), then they were not privileged either 
because they fell within category (11) or because the disclosure of a later draft to 
Powerhouse waived privilege in the predecessor draft on which it was apparently based. 
As an alternative line of attack in relation to this alleged batch of infringements, Mr 
Watson also relied on the principle that "advice sought or given for the purpose of 
effecting iniquity is not privileged" Barclays Bank Plc —v- Eustice [1995] 1 WLR 1238 at 
1249b. The iniquity relied on by him was giving a lawyer a draft, in respect of which 
copyright existed, for the lawyer to improve. 
I think that it is appropriate to deal with this part of the case shortly. It is tempting to take 
the view that since it was not clearly proved that there were any documents which are 
worth debating (because of the position taken by Mr Monson) I should not deal with this 
at all. However, it has been a matter of some dispute between the parties, and I think that 
it would be useful and proper for me to make some rulings for the guidance of the parties, 
and in particular for the guidance of the defendants who can be seen to have taken a line 
in relation to privilege that was not justified (see their insistence on redacting level 1 and 
level 2 references, above). However, I shall not deal with the point at great length 
because I think that the answers are relatively straightforward and, because I find it very 
hard to believe that any significant amount of damages can turn on them. I consider the 
legal position to be as follows: 
a. Any copy of the CAA which was created with a view to its being submitted to 
solicitors for advice does not, despite its purpose, attract privilege. That this is 
clearly the case appears from Dubai Bank Limited v Galadari [1990] Ch 1980. 
This principle was recently applied and approved in Sumitomo Corporation v 


49. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 28 of 30 


Credit Lyonnais Rouse Limited [2002] 1 WLR 479. Any such copy ought 
therefore to be disclosed and produced. 

b. Any version produced by the solicitor in draft for the purpose of carrying out his 
function of giving legal advice to a client would, in my view, be privileged. Such 
drafts, until communicated, are not communications, but it is quite apparent from 
paragraph 29 of the judgment of Longmore L.J. in the Three Rivers case that that 
judge considered that solicitors' drafts are privileged — "all documents passing 
between the BIU and Freshfield are privileged as, indeed, are Freshfields' own 
drafts and memoranda." (my emphasis). 

c. Drafts passed back to the clients, on the assumption that they were part and parcel 
of legal advice, are again privileged. I do not understand on what principle it can 
be said that privilege in those drafts is waived when a yet further draft, which is 
derived from them, is disclosed in circumstances such that that later draft is not 
privileged. Mr Watson advanced no authority in support of his proposition that 
privilege was waived, and I hold that it was not. 

d. There is no evidential basis upon which the iniquity principle can be invoked in 
this case. While I accept Mr Watson's submission that dishonesty as such is not 
necessary in order to invoke the principle, and reject Mr Monson's submission 
that it is, there is no evidence on which I can find that the Defendants were guilty 
of any conduct which even comes close to the level of iniquity which is required 
in order to bar the privilege that would otherwise cloak the communications 
between solicitor and client. Since there is no evidence at all that solicitors were 
involved, but merely supposition, that is not surprising. However, even if one 
were minded to suppose that solicitors were instructed, there is nothing in this 
case to suggest that the Defendants were anything other than innocent in what 
they did. Indeed, in the trial on liability HH Judge Weeks Q.C. expressly rejected 
a finding that the later breach of copyright was flagrant. He had that issue before 
him in the context of an assertion that the Powerhouse breach was flagrant within 
the meaning of Section 97 (2) of the Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988. He 
held that it was not. In that instance the person who authorised the release to 
Powerhouse (Mr Witt) could be identified, as could the circumstances in which it 
happened. He is said to have been honest and mistaken in believing that he was 
entitled to release it. I have not been given evidence to suggest that any other 
servant or officer of the Defendants held any more iniquitous view. I therefore 
reject the submission that the iniquity principle operated so as to deprive the 
Defendants of any privilege which might have arisen in respect of the putative 
instructions to solicitors. 





Issues Relating to Statements of Case 


The applications before me include an application that the Defendants be ordered to 
provide some further information in relation to their pleaded case. However, it was 
agreed that I need not deal with that, and accordingly I do not do so. There is also an 
application by the Claimants to amend their particulars of claim in the enquiry. That was 
resisted on the grounds that those amendments introduced some inconsistencies. I believe 
that most of those points, if not all of them, were ironed out, but the fate of this 


50.

— 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 29 of 30 


application was, so far as I can see, a little lost in the detailed debate on the other, more 
substantial, issues that arose before me. As I understand it, at present there is no longer 
any opposition to these amendments, and if that is right then I shall allow them so far as I 
need to do so. If 1 am wrong about that, then I shall entertain such debate as may be 
necessary in order to resolve outstanding points. 


One Relevance Point 


The documents produced by the Defendants in respect of which redactions in whole or in 
part were made were comprised in a further list produced by the Defendants. There were 
15 of them. It has not been necessary for me to describe those documents in detail in this 
judgment.; I have described their nature in general terms. One special point arises in 
relation to the 15" document, which is the last chronological document. It is described as 
a "copy letter from the first Defendant to Powerhouse Retail Limited" dated 10" April 
2000. this is after the date when the effective deal was done between Powerhouse and the 
claimants, and therefore after the second price reduction which underpins the claim for 
damages. The Defendants objected to the production of the whole of this document — it 
was not a question of merely redacting part — and the original basis of objection was 
privilege. During the course of the hearing, Mr Monson told me that on further reflection 
this document was irrelevant as well, since it did not go to the issues in the inquiry, and 
he sought to resist inspection on that ground too. The parties agreed that rather than have 
an extended debate, or even a short debate, on the appropriate course to be adopted in 
those changed circumstances, the convenient course would be for me to look at the 
document and express my view as to whether it was indeed irrelevant and need not be 
produced. Mr Watson in terms agreed to that course. I have looked at that document and 
read it carefully. Having done so, I am satisfied that Mr Monson is right — while related 
to the overall situation, it is of no relevance (in the disclosure sense) to the issues to be 
debated in the enquiry. I also record that it does contain privileged material, though in my 
view (which does not matter for these purposes in the light of my conclusion on 
relevance) only part of the content is privileged. I therefore will make no disclosure order 
in relation to that document. 


Judicial inspection of other documents 


. I should also record one further thing in relation to the disputed documents. The debate as 


to what redactions should be made to witness statements and the documents emanating 
from Powerhouse took place with the benefit of both parties and my knowing what words 
in question were. That was not the case in respect of the documents which the Defendants 
have themselves redacted. It was at one stage suggested that I should look at all those 
documents (including document 15 to which I have referred) so that I could express a 
view as to whether they were or were not in fact privileged. That suggestion was not 
actively pursued, and the debate took place with only the Defendants knowing what was 
in the allegedly privileged material, as is common in these situations. Nevertheless during 
the course of the hearing, I was provided with a bundle which had unredacted versions of 
all those documents. The provisional view which I reached was that it would not be 
necessary for me to consider the content of those documents if I were able to lay down, 


D2. 


Oo; 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-2 Filed 03/14/16 Page 30 of 30 


with sufficient clarify, the principles with which should be applied in deciding whether 
those documents were privileged. Having come to the conclusions which I have set out in 
this judgment, I maintain that view. The parties agreed that I should retain the unredacted 
bundle in my possession whilst writing this judgment, so that if I thought it necessary or 
useful to refer to it I should be at liberty to do so. The position is that I consider that I 
have been able to lay down sufficient principles to enable Mr Monson and his instructing 
solicitors to do their job of ascertaining which parts of the relevant documents are 
privileged, and it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to substitute my judgment 
for theirs in the circumstances now obtaining. Accordingly, with the exception of 
document 15 which I have referred to above, I have not looked at any of those 
documents. 


The Requirement for a New List 


The Claimants have applied for an order that the Defendants should provide a further list 
of documents relevant to the inquiry. The Defendants have resisted this suggestion on the 
basis that there are no additional documents requiring disclosure beyond those that they 
have specifically listed for the purposes of the privilege claim, and beyond those which 
were already comprised within a list, or lists in the context of the trial on liability. Mr 
Watson countered this by saying it was still appropriate that a proper list should be 
supplied, not least because the Defendants ought to particularise what searches they have 
made. I am quite clear that the Defendants ought to provide a list. At the end of the trial 
on liability, HH Judge Weeks Q.C made an order providing for the enquiry, and 
paragraph 9 of that Order provides for the parties to give standard disclosure by a date in 
May 2003. Standard disclosure requires for the production of a list. I cannot see why the 
Defendants should not provide one, even if all it did was to relist documents already 
supplied, or even annex the old list. At the same time they could and should have given 
such statements as to searches made as were appropriate in the circumstances. That 
would have been very much easier and more cost effective than bringing the matter 
before me (albeit that the time in debate was short), and it and might well have done 
something to allay the suspicion that the Claimants clearly feel in relation to this matter. 
Declining to supply a list is only likely to fuel suspicion, not to allay it. Of course, were it 
the case that a further list were not being provided because the Defendants did not wish to 
say something that would have to be said in connection with such a list (as to which there 
is no evidence) then that would be all the more reason for their providing one; if it is not 
the case then dealing with the situation would be extremely simple. Either way, the 
Defendants should provide the list sought by the Claimants. 


Conclusions 


I shall therefore make such orders as are appropriate in the light of the findings I have 
made in this judgment. The parties will doubtless want to consider that point and decide 
what is technically the best way of going about the matter. In the case of any dispute, I 
shall rule further.

Queen’s Bench Division (Commercial Court). 
Beatson J. 2 
Judgment delivered 22 July 2008. 


Specific disclosure — Litigation privilege — Cross-examination — When court 
could go behind affidavit of documents — Third party sought specific disclosure 

of documents — Litigation privilege claimed — Material sought gathered in course Cc 
of investigations into incident — Dominant purpose of investigations so that 
solicitors could provide legal advice in connection with expected proceedings

— Civil Procedure Rules 1998, r. 32.7 — Control of Major Hazard Regulations 
1999. 


This was an application by the third party (TAV) for specific disclosure of 
documents over which the defendants had asserted litigation privilege. E 


The proceedings arose out of the explosion and fire at the Buncefield 
Oil Terminal in Hertfordshire in December 2005. The fire engulfed a large 
proportion of the terminal’s site and caused injuries to individuals and very 
significant damage to properties in the area. Negligence had been admitted. 
There was to be a trial of preliminary issues to determine, among other things, 
who was the operator of the site for the purposes of the Control of Major Hazard 
Regulations 1999 (‘the COMAH Regulations’), which applied to the site, and 
who was responsible for the negligence and thus liable for the consequences of 
the incident. Those issues involved determining whether the relevant persons 
working at the terminal were ‘embedded’ into Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd G 
(HOSL) so that HOSL alone would be vicariously liable for any negligence on the 
part of those persons. HOSL was a joint venture between Total and Chevron. 


TAV was the engineering company which designed and manufactured the 
high level switch which was fitted to Tank 912 from which the fuel spilled. The 
material TAV sought from the Total defendants and from HOSL was factual 
material gathered by them in the course of their investigations into the incident. 
It included interviews conducted, the outcome of the investigations the operator 
of the site undertook as part of the safety management system it was required to 
have by the COMAH Regulations, and the reports of the accident investigation 
teams set up by Total and HOSL. The Total defendants and HOSL resisted the

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 259 


A applications on the ground that the investigations fell within the rule in Waugh 
v British Railways Board [1980] AC 521 and were covered by litigation privilege. 
Their evidence was that it was expected that civil and criminal proceedings might 
be brought against them and that the dominant purpose of the investigations 
was to identify the causes of the explosion so that their solicitors could provide 
legal advice in connection with the expected proceedings. They argued that 
the dominant purpose of the accident investigations was to obtain factual 
information so that the lawyers could provide advice about the contemplated 
proceedings, and that there was no jurisdiction to go behind an affidavit as to 
disclosure, including one claiming privilege, by ordering cross-examination. 


Cc Held, ruling accordingly: 


1. Where a report was prepared pursuant to a statutory obligation the purposes 
of the instigator of the report were irrelevant. There should be no difference in 
principle where the obligation was a regulatory rather than a statutory obligation. 
However, the Total defendants’ claim for privilege could not be rejected on the 
ground that the Total accident investigation reports and communications were 
produced pursuant to Total’s regulatory duties under the COMAH Regulations: 
while there might be an implied duty under the regulations to investigate, there 
was no duty to report; more fundamentally, it had not been established that Total 
was the operator of the site for the purpose of the COMAH Regulations. That 
E would be a major issue at the trial. (Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 3) (The Times, 24 

June 1993) and Re Barings plc [1998] 1 All ER 673 considered.) 


2. There were a number of respects in which the Total defendants’ affidavits 
were not satisfactory. They did not enable the court to conclude that the claim 
for privilege had been established. They exhibited no documents in support of 
what was said as to the purpose of establishing the Total accident investigation. 
However, in the light of the statement that the dominant purpose in setting up 
the investigation was to prepare for contemplated legal proceedings, it would 
not be appropriate to order inspection of the documents on the ground that the 
defendants had not satisfied the burden of proof. The affidavits did not disclose 
G all that they ought to disclose. A further affidavit should be sworn to deal with 
the matters which the earlier affidavits did not cover or on which they were 
unsatisfactory. (Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Co Ltd v London &

Railway Co [1930] 1 KB 527 and National Westminster Bank ple v Rabobank 
Nederland [2006] EWHC 2332 (Comm) considered.) 


3. On the assumption that there was jurisdiction to order cross-examination in 
this context, this was not an appropriate case for doing so.

JUDGMENT 
Beatson J: Introduction 


1. The principle issue in the applications before me is whether the court can go 
behind an affidavit sworn by a person claiming litigation privilege, and, if so, in 
what circumstances and by what means. The proceedings in which the applications 
have been made arise out of the explosion and fire at the Buncefield Oil Terminal 
in Hertfordshire on 11 December 2005. The fire engulfed a large proportion of the 
terminal’s site and caused injuries to individuals and very significant damage to 
properties in the area. Several hundred million pounds are claimed. There is to be 
a trial of preliminary issues before David Steel J in October 2008. Negligence has 
been admitted. The principal issues now are between the defendants, Total UK Ltd, 
Total Downstream UK plc (the “Total defendants’) and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd 
E (‘HOSL’). 


2. The principal issues include: who was the operator of the site on December 11 
for the purposes of the Control of Major Hazard Regulations 1999 (the “COMAH 
Regulations’), which applied to the site, and who was responsible for the negligence 
and thus liable for the consequences of the incident. These issues involve determining 
whether the relevant people working at the terminal were ‘embedded’ into HOSL 
so that HOSL alone would be vicariously liable for any negligence on the part of 
those people. HOSL is a joint venture between Total and Chevron. If HOSL alone is 
responsible for the incident, the joint venture arrangements may mean that 40% of the 
financial consequences will ultimately be borne by Chevron. 


3. TAV Engineering Ltd (‘TAV’) is the engineering company which designed and 
manufactured the high level switch which was fitted to Tank 912 from which the fuel 
spilled. It is the third party in this action. In application notices dated 22 May and 17 
June 2008 it seeks specific disclosure of documents over which the Total defendants 
and HOSL have asserted litigation privilege. TAV also applied to cross-examine Mr 
Malcolm Jones, the Managing Director of Total UK Ltd, and Mr Richard Jones, a 
director of HOSL, who served affidavits in opposition to the applications, although no 
application notice supported by evidence was issued as required by CPR 32.7. During 
the course of the hearing the applications concerning HOSL were abandoned. TAV 
was right to do so. For reasons I give at the end of this judgment, those applications 
were unsustainable.

262 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


4. The material TAV seeks from the Total defendants and sought from HOSL is A 
factual material gathered by them in the course of their investigations into the incident. 
It includes interviews conducted, the outcome of the investigations the operator of the 
site undertook as part of the safety management system it was required to have by 
the COMAH Regulations, and the reports of the accident investigation teams set up 
by Total and HOSL. The Total defendants and HOSL resist the applications on the 
ground that the investigations fall within the rule in Waugh v British Railways Board 
[1980] AC 521 and are covered by litigation privilege. In affidavits sworn on their 
behalf it is stated that it was anticipated that civil and criminal proceedings would 
be brought against them and that the dominant purpose of the investigations was to 
identify the causes of the explosion so that their solicitors could provide legal advice 
in connection with the anticipated proceedings. C 


5. The Total defendants have also brought Part 20 proceedings against Chevron 
and Motherwell Control Systems (‘MCS’) who installed a computer controlled 
automatic tank gauging system and was responsible for maintaining that and the 
alarm system. The claim against TAV is for an indemnity or contribution on the basis 
that TAV was negligent in the design, manufacture and supply of the switch that 
failed to operate, a failure which caused or contributed to the incident. The switch 
manufactured by TAV was fitted by MCS. It was designed to be triggered when the 
fuel rose to a predetermined distance from the tank top. When it was triggered, an 
alarm would sound in the control room and the flow of oil into the tank would cease. 
TAV has claimed an indemnity or contribution from MCS in the event that it is held E 
liable to pay Total anything. 


The evidence 


6. The evidence before me consists of three witness statements by Mr Robert 
Campbell, a partner in Halliwells LLP solicitors, on behalf of TAV, respectively dated 
22 May and 17 and 19 June 2008, affidavits by Malcolm Jones, on behalf of the Total 
defendants, sworn on 27 June and 7 July 2008, and affidavits on behalf of HOSL 
by David Young, the partner in Eversheds LLP who attended the board meetings of 
HOSL on 5 and 12 January 2006, and Richard Jones, both sworn on 30 June 2008. I G 
leave aside the vital question of the purpose for which the investigations were set up, 
and summarise the non-contentious evidence in a broadly chronological way. 


7. At midday on 12 December 2005, the day after the incident, Davies Arnold 
Cooper gave legal advice to Total’s lawyers in Paris. This was forwarded to Total UK 
soon afterwards and, on the same day the Total Accident Inspection Team (the ‘Total 
AIT’) was set up. Its members were; Steve Ollerhead, then the Logistics Coordinator 
of Marketing Europe for Total France, Jon Cook, Total’s Safety Environmental and 
Quality Manager, John Donald, a Process Safety Expert, and Russell Poynter, Total 
UK’s Head of Legal and HSEQ. The Total AIT was supported by a back office team 
which included individuals from Total’s Paris headquarters. By then representatives

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 263 
(Beatson J) 


A of the Health and Safety Executive and the Environmental Agency were on the site 
and had taken control of it and all computer files and paperwork on the site. A notice 
dated 12 December and headed ‘Buncefield update for colleagues’ was posted on 
Total’s intranet in the name of Malcolm Jones. 


8. Mr Ollerhead’s accident investigation progress report for 11-18 December, 
dated 18 December, states that on 12 December Messrs Chamoux, Sebbane, Gabillet, 
Jegousse, and Blanckaert arrived from Paris and that Mr Poynter and another Total 
representative interviewed the two staff present at the time of the incident and the 
manager of the Buncefield terminal. Mr. Gabillet was at that time the Department 
Head of HSEQ Logistics Marketing for France. 


9. The entry in the progress report for 13 December refers to a list of questions of 
a general nature developed by Mr. Gabillet for the Executive Overview Group. It also 
states that it was agreed on that day that all email communication should be channelled 
through Mr Ollerhead to ensure confidentiality and that there was a meeting with the 
Health and Safety Executive on site to discuss how the HSE investigation would 
proceed and to discuss eventual handover of the site to Total. 


10. A notice dated 14 December posted on Total UK’s intranet over Malcolm 
Jones’s name and headed, ‘Total UK Investigation Team’ states that Malcolm Jones 
had appointed a Total UK team to investigate the incident. 


11. Mr Ollerhead’s accident investigation progress report records that on Thursday 
15 December ‘the AIUK team met to discuss the terms of reference of the AI (see 
separate note)’. 


12. HOSL’s Board met on 16 December and resolved to appoint lawyers to conduct 
the defence of any criminal proceedings and to advise the Board whether the company 
needed to carry out its own investigation into the incident. 


13. A document dated 18 December by Mr Ollerhead, and headed ‘Confidential 
and Legally Privileged’ deals with the organisation and objectives of the Total AIT. 
G Its introduction states: 


‘It is of course vitally important that the accident investigation is carried out as 
effectively and quickly as possible in order to learn the lessons from this incident 
and to implement whatever actions are deemed necessary at other terminals.’ 


14. This document lists and describes the members of the team and the back office 
team. There is an organogram with the Total UK accident investigation team in the 
middle and lines above it to Total Paris and to Total UK’s Managing Director, Mr 
Malcolm Jones. There is a line below the Total AIT to the back office team, to Total 
UK and HOSL personnel as necessary (and through them to the Health and Safety 
Executive and the Environmental Agency), to consultants if required, and to Chevron-

Texaco personnel. There was a query with regard to Chevron-Texaco whose role had A 
not then been agreed. There is also a line to Mr Coull of Total UK HSE on whose 
HSE expertise Mr Poynter is stated to have relied heavily. 


15. Under the heading ‘terms of reference’, the document states that Total UK’s 
investigation would take place in parallel with the HSE investigation and that 
experience from earlier investigations suggested that the HSE would probably not be 
interested in Total’s investigation and their main interest in Total at that stage was to be 
confident that they were cooperating fully. The proposed deliverables include ‘make 
recommendations for measures to be put in place to prevent a recurrence’ , ‘reappraise 
existing risk assessments’ and ‘satisfy legal reporting and recording duties’. It is also 
stated that, ‘due to the urgent need to learn lessons and to make recommendations it Cc 
is suggested that a preliminary report is published by Friday 23 December’. 


16. A memorandum from Mr Ollerhead dated 19 December 2005 was sent to a 
number of people in Total, including Mr Malcolm Jones, Mr Poynter, and others 
from locations in the UK, France and Belgium. It states inter alia that the Buncefield 
explosion had many similarities to an explosion which occurred at Saint Herblain 
near Nantes and recommends that the ‘back office’ team in Paris look into the lessons 
learned from that incident ‘and what we know so far of the incident at Buncefield 
to come up with proposals for a ‘SAFETY/FLASH’ report for rapid implementation 
in order to minimise the risk of this type of explosion happening again’. This 
memorandum is headed ‘Confidential and legally privileged’ and Mr Ollerhead states E 
that recipients should ensure that any replies by email also have this heading. On 19 
December Russell Poynter emailed Barbara Dyer at Chevron, stating inter alia that 
‘the TOTAL investigation team will be required by its parent to continue with its 
work’. 


17.On 20 December 2005 the Health and Safety Commission exercised its power to 
require the Health and Safety Executive and the Environmental Agency to investigate 
the incident. The Buncefield Major Incident Investigation Board (‘BMIIB’) was set 
up under the chairmanship of Lord Newton of Braintree and is doing so. Its terms 
of reference include; a thorough investigation of the incident, establishing causation 
including root causes, identification of information requiring immediate action and G 
recommendations for future action to ensure management of major incident risk 
sites governed by the COMAH regulations. The terms of reference envisage that the 
BMIIB’s report for the HSE and the EA would, subject to legal considerations, be 
made public. The BMIIB has produced progress reports in February, April and May 
2006 and an ‘initial report’ in July 2006. The health and safety investigations after 
the incident suggest that the TAV switch fitted to Tank 912 did not have the padlock 
used to hold the check lever in its normal operational position in place and that the 
check lever had either fallen or been left considerably below its proper operational

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 265 
(Beatson J) 


A 18. On 21 December DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary LLP met Total’s in-house 
legal team and were instructed in relation to possible criminal proceedings against 
Total. 


19. On 22 December HOSL’s Board authorised its Company Secretary and in- 
house lawyer to seek advice from solicitors as to whether it should carry out its 
own investigation. Following receipt of such advice, on 5 January 2006 HOSL’s 
Board resolved to set up a separate HOSL accident investigation team. The team 
was approved at a Board meeting on 12 January and it reported to the Board through 
HOSL’s solicitors, Eversheds. 


C 20. The material before the court includes a number of other documents published 
by Total UK Ltd. There are a number of versions of Total UK Ltd’s Incident Reporting 
and Investigation Application Guide (‘the Guide’), dated between January 2004 and 
February 2006, but there are no material differences between them. The cover of the 
Guide states ‘this Application Guide provides a mandatory system for the reporting 
and investigation of all incidents and near misses throughout Total UK Ltd’. 


21. In the section on its scope, it is stated that the Guide applies throughout all 
of the various operating areas of the company and that all significant incidents or 
near misses involving Total UK’s staff or contract staff that occur on Total premises, 
or while working for Total, must be reported. It is also stated that the guide covers 

E investigation and that the investigation’s purpose is to examine the events leading up 
to the incident, during the incident and the final outcome. This, it is stated ‘will aid the 
discovery of root causes from which remedial action plans can be developed’. 


22. The Guide states there is provision for the electronic recording of incident 
reports and investigations and the downloading of such material onto a database 
system. The information held on the database includes relevant data concerning the 
incident to allow prompt reporting to line management, the insurance department, 
the HSEQ department and the relevant authorities. It includes a calculation of the 
loss potential to determine the level of investigation required, and a description of 
any immediate actions that have been taken to rectify the situation and to prevent the 
G incident from occurring again. The ‘investigation and review’ section of the database 
contains information about the investigation taken to identify the immediate and root 
causes of the incident and an action plan to address them. It also refers to a review 
of high potential incidents by senior management to ensure that all necessary steps 
have been taken to prevent the incident from happening again, and a final review 
by the HSEQ department to ensure that the incident was appropriately reported and 
investigated and that suitable corrective and preventive actions have been identified 
and put in place. 


23. In the case of incidents with a high potential there is a mandatory requirement 
of a formal team SCTA (Systematic Causal Tree Analysis) investigation. The 


Guide states that the categorisation of an incident as of ‘low’, ‘medium’, or ‘high’ 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8

(Beatson J) 


potential depends on the score achieved in matrices of potential severity factors and A 
probability of reoccurrence factors. Guidance is given as to the application of the 
two matrices. Thus an incident that causes multiple fatalities, or major pollution 
with sustained environmental consequences, or over £6 million loss is categorised 
as catastrophic. To qualify as being of high potential a score of 8 or more has to 
be achieved. Accordingly, an incident with ‘catastrophic’ potential severity but a 
‘remote probability’ of reoccurrence would only qualify as of ‘medium’ potential. 
The Guide requires an incident report to be completed within one working day, and 
an investigation to be completed within 10 working days. It states that ‘any fire or 
explosion’ should be reported on the database. 


24. The major accident prevention policy, applicable to the Buncefield site, which C 
is headed “Totalfina Terminal: HOSL’ and ‘Totalfina Great Britain Ltd.’ states that 
the company are committed to ‘evaluate and report our accidents and near misses’. It 
also states that procedures, systems and processes have been put in place to manage 
the integrity of the company’s activities. Paragraph 4 of the section concerned with 
realising the policy states ‘we will report and investigate incidents and near misses 
and follow up as necessary to improve our performance’. This document is signed 
by Mr White, then Buncefield’s Terminal Manager, and Mr Ollerhead, then Total’s 
Director of Logistics. It will be recalled that Mr Ollerhead was a member of the Total 
Accident Investigation Team. 


25. Element 5 of Total’s Loss Control Manual is headed ‘Accident Investigation’ E 
This states: 


“There is a formal procedure HSEQ20, for investigating accidents or near misses. 
This procedure is aimed at fact finding rather than fault finding, and seeks to 
establish basic or root causes of any accident or incident in an effort to prevent 
a reoccurrence.’ 


26. HSEQ20 is Total’s Incident reporting and Investigation Application Guide 
to which I have referred. The Loss Control Manual also states that in the case of 
specified accidents or near-misses, including major fires and spillages: 


“A report must be completed and sent within one working day, with any necessary 
immediate actions recorded. Where an investigation is required this must be 
completed within ten working days, followed by a review meeting to ensure that 
all required actions have either been implemented or programmed.’ 


27. An undated document entitled ‘Spillage Procedure EPO3’ states that spillages 
are considered ‘critical failures’ which are to be reported. The September 2005 job 
specification for safety advisers at terminals includes responsibility for ensuring ‘that 
all incidents are appropriately investigated within 10 working days and that copies are 
sent to the relevant persons as defined in the Application Guide’.

(Beatson J) 


28. Total UK’s corporate social responsibility policy, authorised in May 2005, 
contains a statement by Mr Malcolm Jones that ‘health and safety is a paramount 
priority for the company’ and that it is committed to complying with legislation 
appropriate to its activities to minimise the risk to health and safety at work to 
all employees, contractors, customers, local communities, and general public. Its 
environmental charter signed by Thiery Desmarest, its Chairman and CEO, also refers 
to safety as a paramount priority, the formulation of relevant action plans and suitable 
control procedures and ‘emergency facilities and procedures ... in order to respond 
effectively in the case of accidents’. 


Cc 29. Total UK’s Environment and Social Responsibility Report 2006 contains an 
introduction signed by Michel Contie, a senior vice president for Northern Europe. 
The introduction states that Total continues ‘to put safety at the forefront of everything 
we do and the company acts on near misses’. The introduction also states: 


“We are still analysing lessons learned from the December 2005 fire at the 
Buncefield terminal operated by Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL), in 
which we are a 60% share holder. While still awaiting the findings of the official 
enquiry, we are nonetheless working with the industry and the regulators to share 
information and consider lessons learned.’ 


E 30. The Corporate Social Responsibility section of the report refers to safety 
reporting and internal audits. The section on health and safety has a section entitled 
‘Lessons from Buncefield’. This states: 


‘Following the fire at Buncefield terminal in 2005, investigations have been 
carried out by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Environment Agency, 
site operator Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) and Total. In parallel, a 
task group comprising a number of working groups with both regulator and 
industry representatives has very successfully brought together all the industry 
stakeholders including unions to share learnings and recommend improvements 
across the industry. 


Although we still await the HSE’s final report and response, along with the rest 
of the industry we have already taken many actions including assessments of 
remotely operated shut off valves and tank alarms set points.’ 


31. An update notice about the Buncefield incident posted on Total UK’s intranet 
on 10 February 2006 over Malcolm Jones’s name states inter alia ‘there are three 
investigation teams currently working to ascertain the cause of the incident. One each 
from the HSE, Total and HOSL’.

(Beatson J) 


The COMAH Regulations A 


32. These regulations impose obligations on the operator of the Buncefield site. 
The COMAH Regulations define the operator of a site as ‘a person who is in control 
of the operation of an establishment or installation’: reg. 2(2). Regulation 5 requires 
the operator to have a Major Accident Prevention Policy ((MAPP’) document with 
sufficient particulars to demonstrate it has established a Safety Management System 
(‘SMS’), taking account of the principles specified in the regulations (reg. 5(3)). 


33. Regulation 4 imposes a general duty on operators to take ‘all measures 
necessary to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences to persons and 
the environment’. It was submitted on behalf of TAV that the ‘measures’ include C 
investigations into incidents. Regulation 5(5) requires the operator to implement the 
policy set out in its MAPP document. 


34. Regulation 7(7) requires the operator of an existing establishment to send to 
the competent authority (the Health and Safety Executive and Environmental Agency 
combined) a safety report containing the information specified in the schedule. 
Schedule 2, which applies to regulation 5(3), provides that the Safety Management 
System issue shall address monitoring performance and ‘the mechanisms for 
investigation and taking corrective action in the case of non compliance’ (paragraph 
4(f)). Paragraph 4(f) also provides that the procedures should cover the operator’s 
system for reporting major accidents or near misses, ‘and their investigation and E 
follow up on the basis of lessons learned’. The purpose of safety reports, including 
those required by regulation 7(7), is to demonstrate that a safety management system 
for implementing the major accident prevention policy has been put into effect 
and that adequate safety and reliability have been incorporated into the design and 
construction, and operation and maintenance of any installation and equipment. 


The requests for the documents and the claim to privilege 


35. On 13 March 2008 Pinsent Masons, which acts of behalf of some of the 
claimants in the action, wrote to Total’s solicitors, Davies Arnold Cooper, about a 
number of disclosure matters. Paragraph 9 of this letter states: G 

‘... There are certain categories of post-incident documents, including (i) 
investigation report or “root cause” analysis carried out by your clients or HOSL 
and (ii) documents generated as a result of the HSE investigation which ought 
to have been, but do not appear to have been, disclosed. As to (i) it is common 
practice within the industry for oil companies to prepare such reports/analyses 
following major health and safety incidents which occur during the course of 
their operation. Indeed, the COMAH regulations require the operator of sites 
such as HOSL to have in place a major accident prevention policy, which 
includes procedures for reporting major accidents or near misses, particularly 
those involving failure of protective measures ... Any such report would go into

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 13 of 39

(Beatson J) 


A significant detail as to the causes of the incident and would be of considerable 
evidential value. There is no obvious reason why any such documents would 
be privileged. As to (ii), we consider that documents which passes between 
your clients/HOSL and the HSE in the course of its investigation would not be 
privileged and ought to be disclosed, including final witness statements.’ 


36. On 4 April, Pinsent Masons wrote to Davies Arnold Cooper and Herbert 

Smith noting that although Davies Arnold Cooper had indicated it would revert 

on the matters raised in paragraph 9 and other paragraphs ‘in due course’. They 

had not had a response. The letter states that they are principally concerned to see 

documents pertaining to Total’s post incident investigation or root cause analysis into 

C the incident. The letter enclosed a copy of the email from Russell Poynter to Barbara 
Dyer at Chevron to which I have referred. 


37. Davies Arnold Cooper responded to Pinsent Masons in a letter dated 23 April. 
The material parts of this letter state: 


‘In the immediate aftermath of the Buncefield incident, by which we mean the 
morning of the incident itself, Sunday 11 December 2005, it was apparent to 
senior members of our client’s management structure, including Mr Russell 
Poynter, Head of Legal at Total UK Limited (‘Total’), that the size and scale 
of the incident was such that civil claims for compensation were inevitable and 
E that, given our clients’ connection with the terminal amongst others, it was likely 
that they would be parties to those proceedings. It was also apparent that there 
was a real prospect of criminal prosecution under health and safety legislation. 
There was therefore an immediate recognition that it would be necessary to 
ascertain the causes of the explosion in order to obtain properly informed legal 
advice and to defend Total’s position in the anticipated legal proceedings. 
Accordingly, whilst there also existed Total’s own internal requirements for 
an accident investigation and the requirement under the COMAH regulations 
for the reporting of major incidents, the immediate and primary purpose of the 
investigation which followed was to obtain a detailed factual understanding of 
the causes of the incident in order that Total’s legal advisers could be properly 
G informed when providing legal advice and more specifically when defending 
Total’s interests in the anticipated legal proceedings. 


At midday on 12 December 2005, that is fewer than 36 hours after the incident, 
this firm provided a report containing detailed legal advice to Total’s Parisian 
lawyers which was forwarded to our clients at 14.57 on 12 December 2005. That 
document, inter alia, highlighted the requirement for investigations to ascertain 
the cause of the incident so that lawyers could be properly instructed for the 
purposes of the anticipated civil and criminal proceedings. 


It is in this context that Total’s Accident Investigation Team (“AIT”) was created 
on Monday 12 December. ... 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 14 of 39 


270 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


On 21 December 2005, a meeting was held between six members of Total’s in A 
house legal team, including Mr Poynter, and Total’s newly appointed criminal 
solicitors, Messrs DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary LLP (“DLA”). At that meeting, 
DLA repeated that in order to be able to provide clear and unambiguous advice 
in connection with the anticipated criminal proceedings, they needed to know 
the full facts surrounding the incident. DLA emphasised the requirement for 
Total’s investigations to be aimed at explaining the factual position in order 
that Total’s defence to the contemplated criminal prosecution could be properly 
formulated. The advice provided during the course of that meeting was reiterated 
and amplified in detail in a briefing note to Total dated 6 January 2006, which 
was acted upon by Mr Poynter in his capacity as Total’s Head of Legal and as a 
AIT member. C 


We confirm that the AIT referred to above produced various reports between 
22 December 2005 and 23 June 2006. Those documents were created for the 
dominant purpose of identifying the causes of the explosion in order that our 
clients’ solicitors could provide legal advice in contemplation of the expected 
civil litigation and criminal proceedings and to assist them to defend Total’s 
interests in the civil proceedings once they were commenced. They are 
therefore privileged. It is not disputed that the AIT investigation and reports also 
address lessons that could be learned from the incident and fulfilled COMAH 
requirements. However, for the reasons already explained, those purposes were 
subsidiary and subservient to the dominant purpose as set out above.’ E 


38. The letter also deals with other reports which it states were prepared for the 
dominant purpose of assisting Total in its defence of civil and criminal proceedings 
and notes of interviews by the competent authority prepared by Total’s lawyers who 
were present and in respect of which legal advice privilege as well as litigation 
privilege is asserted. It also deals with other interviews and the HOSL post incident 
investigation in respect of which both legal professional privilege and common 
interest privilege were claimed. 


39. On 7 May, Halliwells replied stating they did not agree that Total’s 
investigations were privileged and that the relevant question should be whether the G 
investigation following the incident would have been undertaken even if there was 
no reasonable anticipation of proceedings. On 14 May, Davies Arnold Cooper replied 
stating that they had nothing to add to their further letter and maintaining their claim 
to privilege. 


40. Following TAV’s application against the Total defendants, Halliwells wrote 
stating that they would be issuing a specific disclosure application against HOSL and 
stating that Davies Arnold Cooper’s position in the letters dated 23 April and 14 May 
‘can be characterised as a bare assertion that the documents in question were created 
for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice in anticipation of litigation’ and 
that despite the invitation to do so “you have chosen not to expand on that assertion 


© DSP Publishing Ltd [2008] 2 CLC 258 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 15 of 39 


QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 271 
(Beatson J) 


A in correspondence’. The letter then sets out the basis upon which TAV disputes the 
claim that the applicable “dominant purpose’ test has been satisfied and particularises 
the documents sought. 


41. On 17 June the application was issued against HOSL. Halliwells’ letter dated 
18 June accepts that the documents had not previously been requested directly from 
HOSL and that HOSL and its solicitors had not expressed any comments in relation 
to HOSL’s entitlement to assert privilege. 


42. There were further exchanges between the solicitors about the service of 
evidence. In their letter dated 27 June enclosing Mr Malcolm Jones’ affidavit, Davies 
C Arnold Cooper provided two of the documents sought by TAV, a report entitled ‘Initial 
Findings on the Ultra High Alarm Functioning Testing carried out by HSE and HOSL’ 
and the preliminary analysis of the Motherwell disk data. The letter states that these 
reports are subject to legal professional privilege but that Total is willing to waive 
privilege in these documents which were not prepared under the auspices of either the 
Total accident investigation team or the HOSL accident investigation team. 


43. In a letter dated 30 June 2008, Halliwells asked Davies Arnold Cooper to 
confirm that Mr Malcolm Jones would be available for cross-examination at the 
hearing. A similar request was made to Edwards Angel Palmer and Dodge in respect 
of Mr Richard Jones. Neither request gives a reason for the request for cross- 

E examination of the affidavit of a witness at an interlocutory hearing. No reasons were 
given in relation to the request concerning Mr Richard Jones. In a letter dated 2 July to 
Davies Arnold Cooper, Halliwells state, relying on LFEPA v Halcrow [2004] EWHC 
2340 (QB) that the court has jurisdiction to order cross examination on an affidavit 
and this “is particularly so when the affidavit in question cries out for elucidation, as 
is the case with Mr [Malcolm] Jones’ affidavit’. 


44. Although Davies Arnold Cooper’s letter of 23 April containing reasons the 
writer regards the documents sought as privileged is before the court, there is no 
affidavit in support of the claim from a member of the firm. The evidence in support 
of the claim is contained in Mr Malcolm Jones’ first affidavit. Paragraph 5 lists the 

G members of the Total AIT and states that Russell Poynter is a member ‘in his capacity 
as Total’s Legal Manager’. The affidavit also states: 


‘4. As Managing Director of TUKL, my duty is to protect its best interests. In 
that capacity, I was responsible for setting up the Total Accident Investigation 
Team (“AIT”) on 12 December 2005 in response to the major fire and explosion 
at Buncefield on Sunday 11 December 2005 (the “‘incident’’). 


6. At the time that I set up the AIT, the Health and Safety Executive (“HSE”) 
and the Environmental Agency (“EA”) were already on site and had started 
their investigation. These investigations are ongoing. The HSE took control 
of the Buncefield site and of all access to all computer files and paperwork 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 16 of 39 


272 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


on site in order to carry out their investigation. The investigation was then the A 
HSE’s highest priority investigation and in the region of 40 HSE personnel were 
involved from the outset. The purpose of the HSE’s investigation was to find out 

what happened and the cause or causes of the incident. Total has at all times fully 
cooperated with the HSE’s investigation. 


7. As soon as I learned of the incident, my immediate concern was to ascertain 
the extent of any injuries and other damage. Having quickly established that only 
minor injuries had been suffered, I then turned my mind to the risks affecting 
Total as a Company. I was fully aware of the likelihood of both civil and criminal 
proceedings and that Total needed to establish the facts in order to be in a position 
to defend its interests in relation to any proceedings. C 


8. In setting up the AIT, the main risks to Total which I was concerned with were: 
(1) the risk of criminal proceedings being brought either by HSE or the EA; (2) 
the risk of civil claims being brought by third parties; and (3) the risk to the 
image and reputation of Total. I considered TUKL to be at real risk of potential 
proceedings following the Incident. The fact that the terminal was under joint 
venture control through Hertfordshire Oil Storage Limited did not make me 
feel Total was free of risk of litigation. I expected that parties who had suffered 
damage might very well explore the chance to claim from Total. My objective in 
setting up the AIT was therefore to gather facts in order that Total could address 
these risks and, in particular, secure legal advice in respect of any criminal and E 
civil proceedings. 


9. Given that the primary purpose of the AIT was to prepare for criminal and civil 
claims and get legal advice, I appointed Russell Poynter, Total’s Legal Manager, 
to the AIT from the outset. There is no provision for the inclusion of a legal 
representative on accident investigation teams in Total’s procedures and this was 
the first time that Russell Poynter, or any other legal representative, had been 
included in a Total accident investigation team. Russell Poynter reported to me 
routinely in line with the primary purpose of the AIT and following the Incident, 
he took immediate steps to instruct external solicitors to act for Total. Davies 
Arnold Cooper were instructed to advise Total in respect of potential civil claims G 
on the day of the Incident. DLA Piper (“DLA”) were instructed on 21 December 

2005 to advise Total in respect of potential criminal liability. 


10. On their appointment DLA took over responsibility for the AIT and from 
then onwards Russell Poynter and DLA reported to me in respect of the AIT’s 
progress. I had regular updates from both Roy Tozer, the partner at DLA, and 
Russell Poynter as to the progress of the AIT. 


11. Of course, the AIT investigation would by necessity carry out a factual 
analysis and look at what went wrong and what lessons could be learned. 


However, this was not the primary purpose for which the AIT was established.

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 273 
(Beatson J) 


A I knew that the HSE investigation would consider the lessons to be learned by 
Total and others in the industry. My main concern was to protect Total from the 
risks I have outlined above. Steve Ollerhead, Jon Cook and John Donald’s role 
on the AIT was to provide the appropriate expertise to establish the facts in order 
that the legal risks could be addressed. I wanted the members of the team to have 
a free rein to investigate the facts in order that the lawyers and I could understand 
the risks identified above as soon as possible. 


12. I have been shown a note prepared by Steve Ollerhead dated 18 December 
2005 attached to an email from Steve Ollerhead dated 19 December 2005 to, 
amongst others, me. [The email and the documents attached to it are exhibited 
C to Mr Jones’s affidavit.] I understand that this email and its exhibits are among 
the documents over which TAV has challenged Total’s claim to privilege in this 
application. For the avoidance of doubt by referring to in and exhibiting this 
document to this Affidavit for the limited purposes of this application, I am not 
waiving Total’s legal professional privilege in it or in any other document or 
legal advice received by Total. I do not recall seeing this document at the time 
and do not believe I would have looked at the document as we were working 
mainly through oral communication at the time. In the aftermath of the Incident 
most of my days were spent either in meetings or on the telephone, and I was 
only reading emails which were specifically being brought to my attention. In 
his note of 18 December 2005, Steve Ollerhead sets out his understanding of the 
E terms of reference of the AIT, in particular under the “Proposed Deliverables” 
heading. Steve Ollerhead’s note reflects an incorrect understanding of my aims in 
instituting the investigation and does not encapsulate the primary purpose of the 
AIT as set out above. While the fact-finding exercise was important, the primary 
purpose of the AIT was not in relation to learning lessons for the future. 


13. It has been explained to me that TAV have asserted that (i) the AIT may 

have been set up in accordance with either HOSL’s Safety Management System 

(“SMS”) or TUKL’s corporate emergency response plan and (ii) that it would 

have been undertaken even if there were no resulting damage to non-Total 

property and no reasonable anticipation of litigation. Those assertions are not 
G correct. 


14. In respect of HOSL’s SMS, that was only relevant to HOSL and had no 
bearing on Total’s response to the Incident. I presumed that HOSL would have 
had an SMS in place but I had no knowledge of its contents. As regards TUKL’s 
corporate emergency response plan, this is aimed at business recovery and 
focuses on how emergencies are handled by TUKL. In setting up the AIT, I did 
not have regard to any internal Total (or HOSL) procedures. In the normal course 
of events if an incident occurred at a joint venture site, the joint venture would 
carry out the investigation itself, not Total. I am aware of a number of occasions 
prior to the Incident when HOSL carried out its own investigation into incidents 
at the Buncefield site.

(Beatson J) 


A 
15. In respect of TAV’s hypothetical suggestion that the AIT would nevertheless 
have been undertaken even if there were no resulting damage to non-Total 
property and no reasonable anticipation of litigation, I do not agree. The AIT was 
only set up because litigation was reasonably anticipated given the extraordinary 
nature of the Incident.’ . 


45. Mr Jones states, of the one day and ten day reports required by the Safety 
Management System, that ‘no such documents were produced’. Nor were any 
documents required by the Total UK Emergency Response Plan produced. 


46. The information contained in Mr Ollerhead’s email and the documents attached C 
to it is summarised in paragraphs 8-9, 11, and 13-16 of this judgment. After the 
service of Mr Jones’ affidavit, Halliwells wrote to Davies Arnold Cooper asking to 
see the complete chain of correspondence from which the emails exhibited to Mr 
Jones’ statement were extracted and for disclosure of all documents evidencing the 
purpose of the Total investigation referred to in Mr Jones’ affidavit. Davies Arnold 
Cooper replied in a letter dated 1 July stating that the email exhibited to Mr Jones’ 
affidavit was not part of a chain of emails, that Mr Jones did not reply to it, and that 
there were no further documents evidencing his purpose in establishing the Total 
investigation. Halliwells responded requesting disclosure of all documents relating to 
the same subject matter as the documents exhibited to Mr Jones’ affidavit and stating 
that its request was not limited to Mr Jones’ purpose but extended to all documents E 
evidencing the purpose of the Total investigation. 


47. On 4 July, Davies Arnold Cooper again stated that there were no further 
documents evidencing Mr Jones’ purpose and enclosed the extracts from notices 
posted on Total’s intranet in the name of Mr Jones, some of which touch on the 
Total AIT and other investigations, to which I have referred. This letter was written 
while Mr Jones was out of the country and he dealt with the material referred to in 
his second affidavit sworn on 7 July. Mr Jones states that these postings do not deal 
with the purpose of the Total AIT investigation and do not record that his primary 
purpose in setting up the Total AIT was to gather facts in order to secure legal advice 
in respect of prospective civil and criminal proceedings. He states that although the G 
postings bear his name, they were drafted by Total’s corporate communications team. 
He does not recall commenting on the drafts although it was likely he would have 
reviewed them. He states that there is nothing in the postings that causes him concern 
as they simply advise staff that the fact-finding exercise was underway. He also states 
that Total’s internal web pages are not an appropriate place to advertise to Total’s staff 
his motive for setting up the AIT enquiry. The final paragraph of this affidavit states 
that, as set out in his first affidavit, Mr Jones’ primary objective in setting up the AIT 
enquiry was to gather the facts in order that Total could secure legal advice in respect 
of any criminal and civil proceedings.

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 275 
(Beatson J) 


A 
Summary of the parties’ submissions 
48. Mr Pollock QC’s submissions on behalf of TAV can be summarised as 
follows: 
B 


(1) Mr Malcolm Jones’s affidavit is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. 


(a) It states that, but for the anticipated legal proceedings, Mr Jones would not have 
set up an AIT. However: 


Cc (i) It does not deal with the Total documents. These show that there is a mandatory 
investigation of all major incidents and near misses. 


(ii) It does not explain the roles of others in the company and the role of the Paris HQ 
although there was input from Paris to the AIT. Mr Ollerhead’s organogram suggests 
the AIT reported to Paris. In considering the evidence, it is important that the parties 
claiming privilege are Total UK Ltd. and Total Downstream Oil Storage Ltd. It is 
their status and their purpose that is important. Mr Jones’ evidence must be assessed 
in the light of this. 


(iii) The statement is not consistent with Davies Arnold Cooper’s letter of 23 April. 
E That letter refers to Total’s own internal requirements and to the COMAH regulations 

but states that the immediate and primary purpose of the investigation was to obtain a 

factual understanding so the lawyers could be properly informed when advising. 


(b) It states (paragraph 10) that Mr Poynter and DLA Piper reported to him in respect 
of the AIT’s progress. However, the emails exhibited to the affidavit suggest that 
information went to a wide variety of people within the Total group including a 
number of people in Total France, who were more likely to be interested in safety 
given the number of Total sites. Moreover, Mr Ollerhead’s organogram does not 
include links to the legal advisers. 


G (c) It states that they were working mainly though oral communication at that time 
and that was why he did not read Mr Ollerhead’s email and its attachments, but there 
is no evidence of oral communication with Mr Ollerhead, whose progress report states 
that it had been agreed that all email communications be channelled through him. 


(d) It states that Mr Ollerhead’s note misunderstands Mr Jones’s aims in instituting 
the investigation but does not say what, if anything, he said to Mr Ollerhead or other 
members of the AIT about those aims. The purposes and the timetable set by Mr 
Ollerhead reflected ‘the urgent need to learn lessons’ and suggest that Mr Jones did 
not explain his objectives to the AIT team.

276 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


(e) His statement that he had no regard to any of Total or HOSL’s procedures does not A 
make clear whether he did not know about these or whether he knew about them but 
did not consider they were applicable or decided to bypass them. 


(f) Mr Jones’ statements as to what his ‘objective’ was do not make it clear whether 
the stated one was his only objective. His statement in paragraph 9 that preparation 
for anticipated legal proceedings was the ‘primary purpose’ of the AIT, does not 
exclude another non-privileged purpose. 


(g) Mr Jones states that his duty was to protect Total UK’s best interests and in that 
capacity he was ‘responsible’ for setting up the Total AIT. Mr Pollock submitted that 
‘responsible’ means that it was Mr Jones who appointed the members of the AIT, and Cc 
not that it was he who decided to have an AIT. 


(2) It must be possible to go behind an affidavit as to discovery because otherwise 
a party would be able conclusively to claim litigation privilege by his ipse dixit. 
The Rules of the Supreme Court did not make provision for cross-examination on 
affidavits prior to trial as CPR 32.7 does. The effect of CPR 32.7 taken together with 
the procedure in CPR 31.19 for challenging a claim of privilege means that the old 
authorities do not survive. Accordingly, there is jurisdiction under the CPR to order 
cross-examination on an affidavit as to discovery where the court, having carried out 
the necessary balancing, considers that the overriding objective requires it. 


(3) Total’s position as the operator of the site within the COMAH regulations meant 
it was under a regulatory duty to investigate with the result that, irrespective of what 
Mr Jones’ purpose was in setting up the Total AIT, in the light of the decision of Sir 
Richard Scott V-C in Re Barings plc [1998] 1 All ER 673 the AIT’s reports were not 
protected. That decision is authority for the proposition that, where a person or entity 
is under a statutory or regulatory duty to investigate and report, the purposes of those 
who instigate the investigation that leads to the report are irrelevant. Mr Pollock 
recognised the difficulty faced by the court that arises from the fact that a major issue 
in the litigation is whether it was Total or HOSL that was the operator of the site for 
the purpose of the COMAH regulations. 


49. Lord Grabiner QC’s submissions on behalf of Total (and those of Mr Edey on 
behalf of HOSL) can be summarised as follows: 


(1) The affidavits sworn on behalf of the Total defendants and HOSL clearly state 
that the dominant purpose for the AITs was to obtain factual information so that the 
lawyers could provide advice about the contemplated proceedings. 


(2) There is no jurisdiction to go behind an affidavit as to disclosure (including one 
claiming privilege) by ordering cross-examination. If there is such jurisdiction, it 
is confined to the very narrow circumstance where the maker of the affidavit or 
the responsible authority contradicts what is said in the affidavit. In the case of the

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 21 of 39 


QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 277 
(Beatson J) 


A Total defendants, the issue is Malcolm Jones’s purpose in setting up the Total AIT, 
not Mr Ollerhead’s or anyone else’s. None of the material relied on by TAV directly 
contradicts what Mr Jones says. There should be no cross-examination where it would 
lead to a mini-trial at an interlocutory stage on what is an important issue in the case, 
as will often be the case. It would in this case because one important issue is whether 
Total or HOSL was the operator of the site within the COMAH regulations. Mr Edey 
also submitted that there should be no cross-examination where cross-examination 
was likely to stray into areas undoubtedly covered by legal professional privilege. 
Cross-examination of Richard Jones would necessarily have involved questions about 
the purposes of the HOSL Board at meetings attended by Mr Young who was present 
and gave the Board legal advice about the setting up of a HOSL AIT. 


(3) TAV’s reliance on Re Barings plc is misplaced. First, there is no duty under the 
COMAH regulations to investigate and report. Secondly, both Total and HOSL deny 
they were the COMAH operator of the site. Which of them was the operator will be a 
major issue in the litigation. It is not possible for the court to resolve the submission 
that as a result of Re Barings plc the AIT reports and papers are not privileged without 
resolving who is the COMAH operator, and it is not appropriate to do this in respect 
of a major issue at an interlocutory stage. Thirdly, Re Barings plc is not authority for 
the proposition for which it is cited by TAV. 


E Discussion 
Litigation privilege 


50. Legal professional privilege is recognised as a fundamental substantive right 
which prevails over the public interest in all relevant material being available to 
courts when deciding cases: see R v Derby Magistrates’ Court, ex parte B [1996] AC 
487, 507-508; Re L (A Minor) (Police Investigation: Privilege) [1997] AC 16, 32; R 
(Morgan Grenfell & Co Ltd) v Special Commissioner of Income Tax [2003] 1 AC 563 
at [7]. The burden of establishing that a communication is privileged lies on the party 
claiming privilege. This is implicit in Lord Edmund Davies’s words in Waugh’s case, 
G quoted in paragraph [52] below, and is also implicit in the other speeches in Waugh’s 

case: see also Re Highgrade Traders Ltd [1984] BCLC 151, at 175d; National 
Westminster Bank plc v Rabobank Nederland [2006] EWHC 2332 (Comm) at [53]; 
LFEPA v Halcrow Gilbert & Co Ltd [2004] EWHC 2340 (QB) at [48]; Matthews & 
Malek on Disclosure (2007) 11-46. 


51. Litigation privilege differs from legal advice privilege, which protects all 
communications to lawyers. It relates only to communications at the stage when 
litigation is pending or in contemplation, and only those made for the sole or dominant 
purpose of obtaining legal advice or conducting that litigation. The modern law on 
litigation privilege stems from the decision of the House of Lords in Waugh v British 
Railways Board [1980] AC 521, a decision in which the approach of the High Court 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 22 of 39 


278 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


of Australia in Grant v Downs (1976) 135 CLR 674, and in particular the formulation A 
of Barwick CJ (at 677), was adopted. 


52. In Waugh’s case Lord Edmund Davies stated that he would certainly deny 
a claim for privilege when litigation was merely one of several purposes of equal 
or similar importance intended to be served by the material sought to be withheld 
from disclosure. He stated (at 542) ‘it is surely right to insist that, before the claim is 
conceded or upheld, such purposes must be shown to have played a paramount part’ 
and (at 543) that ‘the public interest is, on balance, best served by rigidly conforming 
within narrow limits the cases where material relevant to litigation may lawfully be 
withheld’. Lord Wilberforce said (at 531) that it was clear that the due administration 
of justice strongly required the disclosure and production of the Board’s report on C 
an accident, and that in order to override this public interest the sole or dominant 
purpose of the report had to be to prepare for litigation. In Bank Austria Akt v Price 
Waterhouse (16 April 1997) Neuberger J said: 


“A claim for privilege is an unusual claim in the sense that the legal advisers to 
the party claiming privilege are, subject to one point, the judges in their own 
client’s cause. The court must therefore be particularly careful to consider how 
the claim for privilege is made out.’ 


53. Thus, affidavits claiming privilege whether sworn by the legal advisers to the 

party claiming privilege as is often the case, or, as in this case, by a Director of the E 
party, should be specific enough to show something of the deponent’s analysis of the 
documents or, in the case of a claim to litigation privilege, the purpose for which they 
were created. It is desirable that they should refer to such contemporary material as 
it is possible to do so without making disclosure of the very matters that the claim 
for privilege is designed to protect. On the need for specificity in such affidavits, see 
for example, Andrew Smith J in Sumitomo Corp v Credit Lyonnais Rouse Ltd (2001) 
151 NLJ 272 at [39], referred to without criticism by the Court of Appeal [2002] 1 
WLR 479 at [28], although the court did not (see [81]) consider the criticisms of the 
affidavit in that case were justified. 


54. Notwithstanding these threshold requirements, and the care the court must G 
show, once it is established that a communication was made when litigation was 
contemplated or pending and for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice, 
the privilege cannot be overridden by another public interest. As Lord Scott stated in 
Three Rivers District Council v Bank of England (No. 6) [2005] 1 AC 610 at [25]: 


‘if a communication or document qualifies for legal professional privilege, the 
privilege is absolute. It cannot be overridden by some supposedly greater public 
interest. It can be waived by the person, the client, entitled to it and it can be 
overridden by statute but it is otherwise absolute.’

(Beatson J) 


A 55. The principles applicable to litigation privilege were usefully summarised by 
Aikens J in Winterthur Swiss Insurance Co v AG (Manchester) Ltd [2006] EWHC 
839 (Comm) at [71]: 


“Litigation privilege” extends, in time, to information (which must include 
information stored in electronic form as well as in documentary form) which is 
produced either during the course of adversarial (as opposed to inquisitorial or 
investigative) litigation, or when such litigation is in contemplation. The privilege 
obviously covers legal advice given by a lawyer to his client for the purposes 
of such existing or contemplated litigation. It also extends to communications 
between the lawyer and his client and the lawyer and third parties, provided that 
C those communications are made for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining 
legal advice or conducting that litigation. (Grant v Downs (1976) 135 CLR 674, 
per Barwick CJ (dissenting in the result) at p. 677, Waugh v British Railways 
Board [1980] AC 521, Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No. 6) at paras 100 
to 102 per Lord Carswell.) In deciding whether a communication is subject to 
“litigation privilege”, the court has to consider objectively the purpose of the 
person or authority that directed the creation of the communication. (Guinness 
Peat Properties Ltd v Fitzroy Robinson Partnership [1987] 1 WLR 1027 at 1037 
per Slade LJ, with whom Woolf LJ and Sir George Waller agreed.)’ 


56. Aikens J considered (see [83]) that in considering whether material might be 
E subject to litigation privilege three questions arise. These are: 


‘First, at the time that the relevant communications were created, was litigation 
contemplated? Secondly, were the communications created for the dominant 
purpose of obtaining legal advice for that litigation or in aid of that litigation? 
Thirdly, under the direction of which person or entity, objectively speaking, were 
those communications created.’ 


57. In the present case, there is an issue as to the second and third of these 
questions. The issue as to the second question depends on the approach of the court 
to the affidavits sworn by Mr Malcolm Jones. The issue as to the third question 

G depends on whether what is relevant is the purpose of Mr Jones, the purpose of Total 
UK and Total Downstream Oil Storage Ltd., or the purpose of the wider Total group. 
In Guinness Peat Properties v Fitzroy Robinson Partnership [1987] 1 WLR 1027 the 
defendant architects were required by the terms of their insurance policy to notify 
their insurers of any potential claim and their administrative partner Mr McLeish did 
so. He wrote the letter because of that requirement and not to obtain legal assistance. 
The letter was held to be privileged. Slade LJ stated (at 1036C—1037C): 


‘In my judgment the proposition that the dominant purpose of a document 
does not necessarily fall to be ascertained by reference to the intention of its 
actual composer is borne out by a number of recent authorities. Barwick CJ’s 
formulation of the test [in Grant v Downs] itself refers to the dominant purpose of 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 24 of 39 


280 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


its author “or of the person or authority under whose direction, whether particular A 
or general, it has produced or brought into existence”. These words are not to be 
read as if they had statutory force. Nevertheless, I think that in the present case 
the insurers are to be regarded as the persons under whose direction the McLeish 
letter was brought into existence, within the sense and spirit of this formulation. 


In Waugh itself, it seems clear that their Lordships were directing their attention 

not so much to the intentions of the two officers of the British Railways Board 

who prepared the report there under consideration as to the intentions of the 
board in directing them to prepare it. In that case the claim for privilege failed 

only because the purpose of obtaining legal advice in anticipation of litigation 

was of no more than equal weight with the board’s purpose of railway operation C 
and safety.’ 


58. Slade LJ stated that, similarly, in McAvan v London Transport Executive [1982] 
CA Transcript 498 and Re Highgrade Traders Ltd [1984] BCLC 151 the Court of 
Appeal reached its decisions by reference to the intentions respectively of the London 
Transport Executive and the insurance company which procured the reports rather 
than by reference to the intentions of the writers of the reports. 


59. The Guinness Peat case and Re Highgrade Traders differed from Waugh’s case 
because in Waugh’s case it was officers within the defendant who prepared the report 
whereas in the other cases it was an entity other than the party seeking privilege, in E 
Guinness Peat, the architectural partnership, and in Re Highgrade, the loss adjusters. 
In Re Highgrade Traders the affidavit had been made by Mr Alexander, the responsible 
officer in the insurance company dealing with the claims. There was no suggestion 
that what he stated about the insurance company’s purpose was unauthorised or did 
not reflect that purpose. 


60. In the present case, Mr Pollock submitted that, in the light of the decision in Re 
Barings plc [1998] 1 All ER 673, whatever the purpose of Total UK Ltd and Mr Jones, 
the reports of the Total AIT are not protected by litigation privilege. In Re Barings a 
firm of solicitors prepared a report for the Department for Trade and Industry at the 
request of the administrators of a company ‘in compliance with’ the administrators’ G 
statutory duty to report to the DTI pursuant to section 7 of the Company Directors 
Disqualification Act 1986. The statutory intention in requiring a report to be made is 
to place the Secretary of State in the possession of facts and opinions necessary to 
enable him to decide whether to commence disqualification proceedings: see [1998] 
1 All ER at 676b. Inspection was resisted on the grounds of privilege and lack of 
sufficient relevance. The latter ground was rejected. 


61.As to the claim of privilege, Scott V-C stated (at 678g—h) that his initial reaction 
on being told that legal professional privilege was being claimed for a statutory report 
was one of ‘some incredulity’. He stated that, despite the weight of authority cited 
by Miss Gloster QC, that sense of incredulity remained but (at 685j and 686e-f) 


© DSP Publishing Ltd [2008] 2 CLC 258 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 25 of 39 


QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 281 
(Beatson J) 


A accepted, in the light of Re Highgrade Traders Ltd and Guinness Peat Properties 
Ltd v Fitzroy Robinson Partnership, that the dominant purpose test in litigation 
privilege is a free-standing criterion which, if satisfied, will entitle a document to 
privilege regardless to whether the production might impinge on the inviolability of 
lawyer/client communications. But (see 687e—688b) none of the authorities involved 
a statutory report. 


62. Scott V-C stated that in the case of a statutory report the maker has no choice 
and is obliged by law to make the report; “the only relevant purpose ... is a statutory 
purpose’. He did not accept that the question whether such a report or information 
for such a report is to be protected by legal professional privilege is to be determined 

C by reference to the purposes of the administrators who make the reports or by their 
expectations as to the use that will be made of those reports. He considered the 
question whether such statutory reports are privileged depends on whether there is 
a public interest requiring protection from disclosure to be afforded to them which 
overrides the administration of justice reasons that are reflected in the discovery rights 
given to litigants. He concluded that in the absence of any public immunity claim 
there was no public interest that required privilege to be afforded to the report. The 
decision has been cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in Visx v Nidex [1999] 
FSR 91 and, although Hollander’s Documentary Evidence 14-23-14-24 criticises 
the use of a balancing exercise in this context, the issue of a report produced under a 
statutory obligation is not addressed. 


Going behind an affidavit 


63. It is necessary to distinguish the wider issue of when a court may go behind an 
affidavit of documents (including one claiming privilege) from the narrower issue of 
whether, and, if so, when, it may order the deponent of such an affidavit to be cross- 
examined. I first consider the authorities on the wider issue. 


64. In Frankenstein v Gavin's House-to-House Cycle Cleaning and Insurance Co 
[1897] 2 QB 62, a decision of the Court of Appeal concerned with the 1875 Rules, the 
defendants’ affidavit objected to producing documents for inspection on the ground 
G that they were part of the evidence supporting its case and did not support or tend 
to support the plaintiff’s case. It was held that such an affidavit must be accepted as 
conclusive save in very limited circumstances, and the plaintiff was not entitled to 
inspect the documents. There was no discussion of cross-examination upon affidavits 

of documents. 


65. Lord Esher MR referred to the earlier case of Attorney-General v Emerson 
(1882) 10 QBD 191, in which he had been a member of the Court of Appeal. He 
stated (at 64) that Attorney-General v Emerson had decided that an affidavit of 
documents ‘must be accepted as conclusive, unless the Court can see, that is to say, is 
reasonably certain, from the statements of the party making it, that he has erroneously 
represented or has misconceived the character of the document in question’. Chitty

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 26 of 39 


282 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


LJ (at 65) stated that there are a few exceptions to the rule, and that the exception A 
material to Frankenstein’s case was that stated in Attorney-General v Emerson, 
which he formulated in the same terms as Lord Esher. AL Smith LJ’s formulation of 

the exception was not tied to the circumstances in Attorney-General v Emerson and 
Frankenstein’s case and was broader. He stated (at 64-65): 


*...it lies upon the plaintiff to get rid of the effect of [the statement in the 
affidavit] by falsifying it, by which I do not mean that he must necessarily shew 

that it is wilfully untrue, but he must establish by some means other than by a 
conflicting affidavit that the defendants’ affidavit is incorrect. ... In order that the 
plaintiff may succeed in doing so, the Court must be satisfied with reasonable 
certainty either from the defendants’ own statements that they have erroneously C 
represented or misconceived the nature of the documents, as was held to have 

been the case in Attorney-General v Emerson, or from some source other than by 
affidavit that the defendants’ affidavit is incorrect.’ 


AL Smith LJ thus appeared to be prepared to go behind an affidavit where it appears 
from a source other than the defendants’ own statements that the defendants’ affidavit 
is incorrect, but stated that the source could not be a counter-affidavit. 


66. Neilson v Laugharne [1981] 1 QB 736 is an example of a court going behind 
an affidavit in determining the dominant purpose of documents for which privilege 
had been claimed. The court relied on contemporary correspondence and the evidence E 
of the person responsible for instituting the inquiry which led to the creation of the 
documents in making a claim that the documents were subject to public interest 
immunity. The case concerned a claim against the Chief Constable of Lancashire 
for trespass, wrongful imprisonment, false arrest and assault. The Chief Constable’s 
response to the letter before action was to write to the plaintiff’s solicitors stating 
he had decided to call for an investigation under section 49 of the Police Act 1964, 
that the investigating officer would be contacting them and the plaintiff, and that the 
question of compensation would be considered at the conclusion of the investigation. 
The defendant claimed that, save for the plaintiff’s own statement, statements taken 
from the plaintiff and a number of other people were protected on public interest 
grounds and by litigation privilege. The affidavit in support of the public interest G 
claim was by the deputy chief constable. That in support of the claim of litigation 
privilege was by a common law clerk who stated that the dominant purpose of the 
investigating officer’s inquiry was to obtain evidence for the defence to the action. 
The claim to public interest immunity succeeded but that to litigation privilege did 
not. 


67. The Court was not prepared to accept the affidavit of the common law clerk in 
the face of the Chief Constable’s letter to the plaintiff’s solicitor, which was direct and 
contemporaneous evidence by the person responsible for instituting the inquiry: see 
Lord Denning MR, and Oliver and O’Connor L JJ, at 745G, 750B-E and 757C. Oliver 
LJ stated that the Chief Constable’s letter to the plaintiff’s solicitors demonstrated that 


© DSP Publishing Ltd [2008] 2 CLC 258 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 27 of 39 


QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 283 
(Beatson J) 


A the dominant purpose of the investigation was the statutory purpose and that had its 
dominant purpose been to provide material for the threatened legal proceedings it 
was a very tricky letter indeed because it in effect invited the prospective plaintiff to 
make a statement to the representative of the prospective defendant under the guise 
of carrying out a statutory inquiry. 


68. The issue came before the Court of Appeal again in Lask v Gloucester Health 
Authority (6 December 1985). The question was whether the Court could go behind 
affidavits sworn by the defendant’s solicitor and one of its administrators that an 
accident report prepared on a report form by the defendant was for submission to 
solicitors in the event of a claim and subject to litigation privilege. O'Connor LJ 

C considered Frankenstein's case and Attorney-General v Emerson and concluded that 
it could, and that the claim of privilege was not established. 


69. In Lask’s case the administrator’s affidavit stated the only reason for requiring 
accident report forms to be completed was to enable them to be given to solicitors in 
the event of a claim. The solicitor’s affidavit stated that he approved a standard form 
for use in accident cases in the 1950s, the form in that case was virtually identical 
to the standard form, and privilege had always been maintained for such forms. His 
affidavit also referred to and exhibited a 1955 National Health Service Circular which 
suggested that an appropriate form be used. Paragraph | of the circular, which was 
still in force, stated ‘from time to time accidents or other untoward occurrences arise 
E at hospitals which may give rise to complaints followed by claims for compensation 

or legal proceedings, and which may also call for immediate enquiry and action to 
prevent a repetition’. 


70. The report form itself stated that the report was prepared for the use of 
solicitors in the event of a complaint or legal proceedings and it was to be submitted 
to the head of department, who should forward it to the unit administrator for onward 
transmission to the sector and district administrators. O’Connor LJ stated that the 
circular differed from the report form because in paragraph | the Department stated 
in terms that the report had a double function; to assist in dealing with claims, and to 
consider whether action is necessary to prevent a repetition. The rest of the circular, 
G however, was concerned with the importance of getting a report would attract the 

privilege which it was, before the decision in Waugh’s case, thought a dual purpose 
report would attract and the solicitor’s affidavit referred to correspondence about the 
form in 1977 which showed the intention was that the form was to be for solicitors’ 
use in the event of a claim and thus would attract the privilege. 


71. O’Connor LJ applied the test stated in Frankenstein’s case and Attorney- 
General v Emerson: were there statements from the party making the affidavit that 
they had erroneously misconceived or represented the character of the accident report. 
He concluded that it was plain from the circular that the report was prepared for a dual 
purpose. He also considered this was plain from the form itself because he saw no 
legal professional purpose in submitting the form to the head of department and the 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 28 of 39 


284 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


other administrators before sending it to the person who was to hold it for submission A 
to the solicitor unless there was a second purpose as envisaged in the circular. The 
county court judge’s decision that the report was a document prepared for a dual 
purpose was upheld. The question of cross-examination on an affidavit of documents 

was not discussed in either Lask’s case or Neilson v Laugharne. 


72. In Re Highgrade Traders Ltd [1984] BCLC 515 the liquidators of a company 
successfully applied under section 268 of the Companies Act 1948 for an order to 
examine an officer in an insurance company about reports by loss adjusters, fire 
experts and accountants prepared for the insurance company in respect of which 
litigation privilege was claimed. Affidavits were sworn by the insurance company’s 
solicitors stating that the dominant purpose for which the reports came into existence Cc 
was in anticipation of litigation and for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. 
The Court of Appeal accepted a submission by the officer that he could not have 
anticipated the need for more detailed evidence before the hearing. A further affidavit 
was sworn and taken into account by the court which, was, however, not convinced 
that it added anything to what was reasonably deducible from the material before it. 


73. Oliver LJ analysed the evidence before the court and concluded that it 
established overwhelmingly that the insurers were actuated by the motive of 
obtaining legal advice in relation to contemplated litigation, which was confirmed 
by a letter written by the insurers’ solicitors. Oliver LJ (with whom Goff LJ agreed) 
stated (at 175) that: E 


‘I would not want it to be thought that the mere writing of such a letter by 
solicitors, whether for insurers or for anyone else, sometimes perhaps as a matter 
almost of routine drill, is in all cases going to be determinative of the question. 
At highest, it is no more [than] evidence of a fact which may require to be 
independently proved.’ 


See also Simon J in National Westminster Bank plc v Rabobank Nederland [2006] 
EWHC 2332 (Comm) at [52]. Earlier in his judgment (at 162) Oliver LJ said: 


‘[I]f there is something in the circumstances of the case which shows that the G 
affidavit evidence is wrong (as there was in Nielson v Laugharne), the court is 
entitled to go behind the affidavit, but I would not ... feel able to subscribe to 
the view that the court is necessarily bound to accept a bare assertion as to the 
dominant motive of a deponent, unaccompanied by some explanation of the 
circumstances, at any rate in a case where more than one motive is possible.’ 


74. Where the Court is minded to go behind an affidavit, there are four options 
open to it. It may conclude, as happened in Neilson v Laugharne and Lask’s case, that 
the evidence in the affidavit does not establish that which it seeks to establish, i.e. 
that the person claiming privilege has not discharged the burden that lies on him, and 
order disclosure or inspection. It may order a further affidavit to deal with matters the

(Beatson J) 


A earlier affidavit does not cover or on which it is unsatisfactory. This is seen in cases on 
inadequate affidavits disclosing assets in response to freezing orders, but also in the 
case of an affidavit as to disclosure or inspection: see Birmingham and Midland Motor 
Omnibus Co Ltd v London and North Western Railway Co [1913] 3 KB 850. See also 
National Westminster Bank plc v Rabobank Nederland [2006] EWHC 2332 (Comm) 
at [53] and [63]; Atos Consulting Ltd v Avis plc (No. 2) [2007] EWHC 323 (TCC) at 
[36]-[37], although in those cases the evidence was by witness statement rather than 
by affidavit: see [2006] EWHC 2332 (Comm) at [34]-[44] and [2007] EWHC 323 
(TCC) at [7], [12], [18]. They are also cases on the third option open to the Court, to 
inspect the documents, which it may do in the circumstances set out in the next two 
paragraphs. The fourth option is that, subject to the restrictions in paragraphs 79-84 
C of this judgment, the court may order cross-examination of the deponent. 


75. Neither TAV not the Total defendants invited me to inspect documents in this 
case. Neuberger J’s view in Bank Austria Akt v Price Waterhouse that inspection of 
documents should be a solution of last resort (in part because of the danger of looking 
at documents out of context) was shared by Simon J in National Westminster Bank plc 
v Rabobank Nederland see [54-55], and by Ramsay J in Atos Consulting Ltd v Avis 
ple (No. 2) [2007] EWHC 323 (TCC) at [36]-[37]. Simon J stated that Rabobank’s 
evidence about the dominant purpose of the report the court was invited to inspect 
was difficult to reconcile with both its documents created at the time and some of its 
other evidence so that, if there is a threshold which has to be crossed before a court 
E can properly be invited to look at documents, that threshold had been crossed and the 
court had discretion to do so: see [34] and [49]-[51]. Simon J stated that the court 
should not inspect the documents unless there is credible evidence that the lawyers 
have either misunderstood their duty, or are not to be trusted, or there is no reasonably 
practical alternative. He did not inspect them but ordered Rabobank’s solicitors 
to make an affidavit verifying the claims to privilege in relation to the documents 
withheld. 


76. Although inspection is not at issue in this case, what is said in cases on 
inspection gives guidance as to the general approach of the court where a claim to 
privilege is challenged. In Atos Consulting Ltd v Avis plc (No. 2) Ramsay J stated 

G (at [37]) that the appropriate course to be adopted where privilege or irrelevance is 
relied on is for the Court to proceed by way of stages. Ramsay J’s first two stages 
are to consider whether the evidence produced on the application establishes the 
right to withhold inspection of a document and there are no sufficient grounds for 
challenging the correctness of that asserted right. If these conditions are met, the 
Court should uphold the right. His third stage arises where the Court is not satisfied 
that the right to withhold inspection is established because, for instance, the evidence 
does not establish a legal right to withhold inspection. He states that in such a case the 
Court will order inspection of the documents. His fourth stage arises where sufficient 
grounds are shown for challenging the correctness of the asserted right. He states 
that in this situation the Court may order further evidence to be produced on oath 
or, if there is no other appropriate method of properly deciding whether the right to

(Beatson J) 


withhold inspection should be upheld, it may decide to inspect the documents. If it A 
inspects the documents it may invite representations. Neither Ramsay J nor Simon J 
referred to the possibility of cross-examination, to which I now turn. 


77. CPR 32.7 makes provision for cross-examination at a hearing other than the 
trial where evidence is given in writing. CPR 31.19(5) provides for a challenge to 
a claim of privilege made under CPR 31.19(3), which when made, is supported 
by a statement of truth. Cross-examination on an affidavit at an interlocutory stage 
has been considered in the context of affidavits disclosing assets sworn in response 
to the order of the court when making a freezing injunction. In that context, it has 
been recognised that the circumstances may mean that it is more sensible, if only for 
reasons of speed and urgency, not to order further affidavits in order to fill the vacuum C 
alleged to exist in the affidavits but to order cross-examination: see House of Spring 
Gardens Ltd v Waite [1985] FSR 173 at 183 per Stephenson LJ. 


78. In Yukong Lines v Rendsburg (17 October 1996, CA) Phillips LJ stated that 
the background of applications for freezing orders is often a situation in which it is 
urgently necessary for the court to intervene in order to assist the claimant to prevent 
the defendant from frustrating the object of the proceedings. He also stated that the 
test is whether it is just and convenient to order cross-examination, and that cross- 
examination is not only available where there is no alternative relief. Even in the 
context of an affidavit in response to a freezing order, however, he regarded ordering 
cross-examination as ‘an exceptional measure’. Motorola Credit Corp v Uzan [2003] E 
2 CLC 1026; [2004] 1 WLR 113 is an example of the circumstances in which cross- 
examination may be ordered. In that case the court found (see at [141] and [147]) that 
there had been piecemeal, late, untruthful and manifestly incomplete disclosure by 
the defendants. 


79. Does the position in relation to affidavits of documents (including those 
claiming privilege) differ? It was submitted on behalf of the Total defendants and 
HOSL that no cross-examination of such affidavits is to be ordered. Matthews & 
Malek on Disclosure (2007) 6-44 states that the weight of authority under the RSC 
“was to the effect that an opposing party could not cross-examine the deponent on his 
verifying affidavit at all’ because the affidavit did not go to any of the issues in the G 
action, and that the position is the same under the CPR. The authors state that in the 
context of freezing and search orders the position at an interlocutory stage is different 
because it may be crucial to establish what has happened to assets prior to trial. 


80. Matthews & Malek rely on the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Birmingham 
and Midland Motor Omnibus Co Ltd v London and North Western Railway Co [1913] 
3 KB 850 and Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 3) (14 June 1993, The Times, 24 June 1993). 
In Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co Ltd v London and North Western 
Railway Co the defendants’ affidavit of documents claimed litigation privilege for 
certain documents. The case was primarily concerned with whether the Court could 
inspect the documents for the purpose of deciding the validity of the claim of privilege,

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 287 
(Beatson J) 


A but also considered the affidavit. The Court of Appeal inspected the documents, as the 
judge in chambers had, and decided that privilege had properly been claimed. As to 
the affidavit, Buckley LJ (with whom Vaughan Williams LJ agreed) stated (at 855): 


‘An affidavit of documents is sworn testimony which stands in a position which 
is in certain respects unique. The opposite party cannot cross-examine upon it 
and cannot read a contentious affidavit to contradict it. He is entitled to ask the 
Court to look at the affidavit and all the documents produced under the affidavit, 
and from those materials to reach the conclusion that the affidavit does not 
disclose all that it ought to disclose. In that case he can obtain an order for a 
further and better affidavit.’ 


81. Buckley LJ also stated that, under the rule then applicable to a specific 
document, the party who is seeking discovery may file an affidavit specifying further 
documents and calling upon the party making the affidavit of documents to account 
for them. Hamilton LJ, citing Jones v Montevideo Gas Co (1880) 5 QBD 556, stated 
(at 858) that although an affidavit of discovery cannot be challenged by cross- 
examination, counter-affidavit or administration of interrogatories: 


‘If from the affidavit itself, or from the documents therein referred to, or from 

an admission in the pleadings of the party from whom discovery is sought, the 

Master or judge is of the opinion that the affidavit is insufficient, he ought to 
E make an order for a further affidavit ...’ 


82. The Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus case was considered in Ankin 
v London and North Eastern Railway Co [1930] 1 KB 527. Scrutton LJ (at 534) 
stated: 


‘It has long been settled that a deponent stating grounds on which he claims 
privilege is not to be met by an opposing affidavit either contradicting him or 
cross-examining him with a view of showing that what he has stated is untrue. 
The other party can only look at the affidavit itself. If it is ambiguously or too 
ingeniously worded, so that its meaning is obscure, he may take the objection that 

G the claim for privilege is not sufficient and may obtain a more precise statement 
of facts.’ 


83. The authorities were reviewed in Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 3) (14 June 1993, 
The Times, 24 June 1993). Lonrho sought discovery of documents relating to very 
large profits which the Fayed brothers said they had made from an oil trading 
partnership in the Middle East since 1979 and about their fortune in Egypt prior to 
1961. The Fayed brothers made affirmations stating there were no such documents in 
their possession. On behalf of Lonrho it was argued that it was incredible that if such a 
partnership existed over many years generating huge profits there were no documents 
in the Fayeds’ possession. Swinton Thomas J ordered that the Fayed brothers should 
be cross-examined on their affidavits of documents. In the Fayed brothers’ appeal, it

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 32 of 39 


288 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


was submitted on behalf of Lonrho that an affidavit of documents made pursuant to A 
an order for specific discovery under RSC Order 24 Rule 7 was not conclusive, and 

that, if it was conclusive, the Court would be powerless to enforce its orders. Stuart- 
Smith LJ (with whom Kennedy and McCowan L JJ agreed) stated (at p. 19C—D of the 
transcript) that the authorities led him to the conclusion that: 


“... on whatever ground the order for a further affidavit is made, whether because 
of some admission by the deponent or the belief of the opposite party that other 
documents exist, the oath of the deponent in answer is conclusive; it cannot be 
contravened by a further contentious affidavit and cannot be the subject of cross- 
examination.’ C 


84. His Lordship stated that dicta in a number of more recent cases and the cases 
in which cross-examination on affidavits is ordered at an interlocutory stage in aid 
of Mareva relief did not alter or modify the well-established rule laid down in the 
authorities for over a century. He said that applications in those cases are for the most 
part concerned with discrete issues which do not impinge on the issues at trial. He said 
(see pp. 24—26 of the transcript) that in other cases ‘the reasons for the rule that the 
statement in the affidavit of documents is conclusive save to the extent that a further 
affidavit may be ordered are not far to seek’. He referred to the fact that the issue to 
be canvassed at the interlocutory stage may impinge on, and be crucially relevant to 
the issues in the trial. To try it at an interlocutory stage could involve injustice, and E 
replace the adversarial process at trial by an inquisitorial inquiry. He also stated that 
protracted interlocutory applications add to both delay and expense and should be 
avoided as far as possible. He stated (see p. 28 of the transcript) that, if he was wrong 
in holding that the statement in an affidavit of documents is conclusive so that the 
court has no power to order cross-examination, ‘the exercise of that power should 
... be reserved for those cases where the existence or non-existence of the document 
raises a discrete issue which does not impinge to any serious extent on the issue in 
the action’. 


85. Finally, there is LFEPA v Halcrow Gilbert & Co Ltd [2004] EWHC 2340 
(QB), a decision of the Technology and Construction Court, in which HH Judge G 
Toulmin QC dealt with a claim to privilege of a report prepared for the London Fire 
and Emergency Planning Authority sought by the defendants in proceedings about 
a construction project that had overrun. The Deputy Head of Legal Services of the 
Authority had made a witness statement and gave evidence that a reference in the 
statement to the report being part of a ‘technical audit’ meant a legal audit for the 
purpose of litigation. It appears that she was cross-examined. The judge stated (at 
[48]) that the burden of proof lies on the party claiming privilege. He rejected the 
evidence of the Deputy Head of Legal Services and concluded that the dominant 
purpose of the report was not for the purposes of litigation.

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 289 
(Beatson J) 


A 
Summary of law 
86. It is possible to distil the following propositions from the authorities on 
challenges to claims to privilege: 
B 


(1) The burden of proof is on the party claiming privilege to establish it: see Matthews 
& Malek on Disclosure (2007) 11-46, and paragraph [50] above. A claim for privilege 
is an unusual claim in the sense that the party claiming privilege and that party’s legal 
advisers are, subject to the power of the court to inspect the documents, the judges 
in their or their own client’s cause. Because of this, the court must be particularly 

C careful to consider how the claim for privilege is made out and affidavits should be 
as specific as possible without making disclosure of the very matters that the claim 
for privilege is designed to protect: Bank Austria Akt v Price Waterhouse; Sumitomo 
Corp v Credit Lyonnais Rouse Ltd (per Andrew Smith J). 


(2) An assertion of privilege and a statement of the purpose of the communication 
over which privilege is claimed in an affidavit are not determinative and are evidence 
of a fact which may require to be independently proved: Re Highgrade Traders Ltd; 
National Westminster Bank plc v Rabobank Nederland. 


(3) It is, however, difficult to go behind an affidavit of documents at an interlocutory 
E stage of proceedings. The affidavit is conclusive unless it is reasonably certain from: 


(a) the statements of the party making it that he has erroneously represented or has 
misconceived the character of the documents in respect of which privilege is claimed: 
Frankenstein v Gavin’s House to House Cycle Cleaning and Insurance Co, per Lord 
Esher MR and Chitty LJ; Lask v Gloucester Health Authority. 


(b) the evidence of the person who or entity which directed the creation of the 

communications or documents over which privilege is claimed that the affidavit is 

incorrect: Neilson v Laugharne (the Chief Constable’s letter), Lask v Gloucester HA 

(the NHS Circular), and see Frankenstein v Gavin's House to House Cycle Cleaning 
G and Insurance Co, per A L Smith LJ. 


(c) the other evidence before the court that the affidavit is incorrect or incomplete on 
the material points: Jones v Montevideo Gas Co; Birmingham and Midland Motor 
Omnibus Co v London and North Western Railway Co; National Westminster Bank 
plc v Rabobank Nederland. 


(4) Where the court is not satisfied on the basis of the affidavit and the other evidence 


before it that the right to withhold inspection is established, there are four options 
open to it: 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 34 of 39 


290 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


A 
(a) It may conclude that the evidence does not establish a legal right to withhold 
inspection and order inspection: Neilson v Laugharne; Lask v Gloucester Health 
Authority. 
(b) It may order a further affidavit to deal with matters which the earlier affidavit does . 


not cover or on which it is unsatisfactory: Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus 
Co Ltd v London and North Western Railway Co; National Westminster Bank plc v 
Rabobank Nederland. 


(c) It may inspect the documents: see CPR 31.19(6) and the discussion in National 
Westminster Bank plc v Rabobank Nederland and Atos Consulting Ltd v Avis plc C 
(No. 2). Inspection should be a solution of last resort, in part because of the danger 
of looking at documents out of context at the interlocutory stage. It should not be 
undertaken unless there is credible evidence that those claiming privilege have either 
misunderstood their duty, or are not to be trusted with the decision making, or there 
is no reasonably practical alternative. 


(d) At an interlocutory stage a court may, in certain circumstances, order cross- 
examination of a person who has sworn an affidavit, for example, an affidavit 
sworn as a result of the order of the court that a defendant to a freezing injunction 
should disclose his assets: House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite; Yukong Lines v 
Rensburg; Motorola Credit Corp v Uzan. However, the weight of authority is that E 
cross-examination may not be ordered in the case of an affidavit of documents: 
Frankenstein’s case; Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co Ltd v London and 
North Western Railway Co and Fayed v Lonrho. In cases where the issue is whether 
the documents exist (as it was in Frankenstein’s case and Fayed v Lonrho) the 
existence of the documents is likely to be an issue at the trial and there is a particular 
risk of a court at an interlocutory stage impinging on that issue. 


87. Mr Pollock submitted that, had the framers of CPR 32.7 wished to preserve the 
old rule and to exclude a power to cross-examine in disputes concerning privilege, 
they could have done so. The Rule does not do so and there is no reference in the 
notes to the White Book to the authorities cited by Matthews and Malek. He submitted G 
that there is provision in CPR 31.19(5) for a challenge to a claim of privilege made 
under CPR 31.19(3) which is made, supported by a statement of truth. There is no 
indication that a court considering a challenge to such a claim cannot order the cross- 
examination of the person claiming privilege. Mr Pollock argued that the CPR is a self 
contained code to which effect should be given. He relied on Biguzzi v Rank Leisure 
ple [1999] 1 WLR 1926 at 1934 where Lord Woolf MR stated that, once the CPR 
applies, ‘earlier authorities are no longer generally of any relevance’. He also relied 
on the statement of May LJ in Purdy v Cambran (17 December 1999). May LJ stated 
that Lord Woolf ‘was not saying that the underlying thought processes of previous 
decisions should be completely thrown overboard’ but that decisions will depend on 
the justice in all the circumstances of an individual case and that it is necessary to

Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 35 of 39 


QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 291 
(Beatson J) 


A concentrate on the intrinsic justice of a particular case in the light of the overriding 
objective rather than on authorities under the former rules. 


88. Notwithstanding Mr Pollock’s submissions, I have concluded that, in view of 
the fact that Rule 32.7 follows the old County Court Rules Order 20 Rule 5 which has 
the same effect as RSC Order 38 Rule 2(3), the old law cannot be discarded in the way 
he submitted it should be. Even if there is no longer a jurisdictional bar to ordering 
cross-examination of the deponent on his affidavit in this context, the exercise of that 
power should be reserved for extreme cases where there is no alternative relief. 


89. In Nomura International plc v Granada Group Ltd [2007] EWHC 642 (Comm); 
Cc [2007] 1 CLC 479 Cooke J stated (at [25]-[26]) that ‘where the new rule under the 
CPR follows the same form and appears to have the same underlying intention’ as 
the rule in the RSC, regard should be had to the principles which the court previously 
applied under the old rule. That statement was made in the context of consideration 
of whether an abuse of process had taken place. The same approach in substance 
was taken in the context of disclosure of documents for the purpose of interlocutory 
proceedings (albeit without reference to the old rules) in Fiona Trust Holding Corp v 
Privalov [2007] EWHC 39 (Comm) at [25]-[27]. 


90. The procedure under the CPR is, in substance, the same as that under the RSC 
although now the claim for privilege is made in a disclosure statement instead of an 
E affidavit. The rationale of avoiding mini-trials at an interlocutory stage is still there. 
Mr Pollock was not able to point to any post CPR authority in support except for 
LFEPA v Halcrow Gilbert and Co. Lord Grabiner and Mr Edey submitted inter alia 
that case was different because the evidence challenged was in a witness statement 
rather than an affidavit. While there are, no doubt, differences between witness 
statements supported by a statement of truth and sworn affidavits, it is difficult to see 
why cross-examination should be permitted where the claim for privilege is made ina 
witness statement but not where the claim is made in an affidavit. That case, however, 
proceeded without consideration of any of the authorities to which I have referred 
and it does not appear from the judgment that there was any argument as to whether 
cross-examination on the evidence given in support of the claimed privilege was a 
G proper course. In those circumstances it is of limited assistance, save as indicating 
(see Hollander’s Documentary Evidence (9th edn.), 2-33) that the position in practice 

may be less dogmatic than the theory. 


91. As to whether there is still a jurisdictional bar to ordering cross-examination 
of the deponent on his affidavit in this context, the need to avoid the party claiming 
privilege being judge in his own case and the statements in the cases that an assertion 
of privilege is not determinative and may require to be independently proved are 
difficult to reconcile with an absolute bar. In the light of the overall approach in the 
CPR, in an extreme case where there is no alternative relief, it may be just to order 
such cross-examination rather than concluding, without such examination, that the 
evidence before the Court does not establish a legal right to withhold inspection and 


[2008] 2 CLC 258 Commercial Law Cases8 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 36 of 39 


292 West London Pipeline v Total UK [2008] 2 CLC 
(Beatson J) 


ordering inspection. This in turn, however, should only be contemplated if it can be A 
done without impinging to any material extent on the issues in the action, and only 
after the court has considered whether the position can be addressed by ordering 
further evidence to be produced on oath, or by inspecting the documents. Even at that 
stage cross-examination is unlikely to be necessary. If the deponent is not able to deal 
with any gaps and inadequacies in a further affidavit it is likely that the burden of 
proof that lies on a person claiming privilege will not have been satisfied. 


Application of the principles to the circumstances of this case 


92. Having summarised the relevant legal principles, I turn to their application in 
the circumstances of this case. Cc 


93. I first deal with the submissions based on the decision in Re Barings plc. That 
case is authority for the proposition that where a report is prepared pursuant to a 
statutory obligation the purposes of the instigator of the report are irrelevant. There 
should be no difference in principle where the obligation is a regulatory rather than a 
statutory obligation. However, I reject the submission that the Total defendants’ claim 
for privilege should be rejected because the Total AIT reports and communications 
were produced pursuant to Total’s regulatory duties under the COMAH Regulations. 


94. While there may well be an implied duty under the regulations to investigate, 
there is no duty to report. More fundamentally, it has not been established that Total E 
is the operator of the site for the purpose of the COMAH Regulations. That will be 
a major issue at the trial. Mr Pollock recognised the difficulty facing the court in 
dealing with this issue. He submitted that I should decide the matter as a question 
of principle, or on alternative assumptions. I am not, however, in a position to deal 
with this issue at this stage, even as a matter of principle. It would risk prejudging 
the issue at the trial on the basis of very limited, indeed almost no, material. The 
only material before me concerning this issue was the exchange of correspondence 
between HOSL and the competent authority which Mr Pollock relied on as showing 
that HOSL had held itself out to the authority as the operator of the site. Apart from 
the fact that that was used as an argument in support of the contention that HOSL 
was the operator under the COMAH Regulations, I was informed that there were G 
similar communications between Total and the competent authority. At the trial, there 
is bound to be a substantial quantity of evidence on this issue. I have not seen any of 
that evidence. This issue is a classic example of the dangers to which Stuart-Smith LJ 
adverted in Lonrho plc v Fayed. 


95. The next issue concerns Mr Malcolm Jones’s affidavits. Are there grounds for 
going behind them? I have concluded that there are a number of respects in which the 
first affidavit is guarded and not satisfactory and that those matters are not addressed 
in the second affidavit. The affidavits do not enable me to conclude that the claim for 
privilege has been established. They exhibit no documents in support of what Mr Jones 
says as to the purpose of establishing the Total AIT. The only documents exhibited are 


© DSP Publishing Ltd [2008] 2 CLC 258 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 57-3 Filed 03/14/16 Page 37 of 39 


QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 293 
(Beatson J) 


A Mr Ollerhead’s memoranda which are said by Mr Jones to reflect a misunderstanding, 
and the postings on Total’s intranet. I set out my reasons for concluding that the first 
affidavit is not satisfactory and then consider the consequence and the appropriate 
course of action. 


96. I do not accept Mr Pollock’s submission based on Mr Jones’s statement of 
what his ‘objective’ was and the references in the affidavit to the ‘primary purpose’ 
of the AIT. It is clear, on a fair reading of the affidavit as a whole, that Mr Jones’s 
evidence is that his dominant purpose in setting up the investigation was to prepare 
for contemplated legal proceedings. Moreover, in referring only to Mr Poynter’s role 
as Head of Legal and not his HSEQ role the affidavit is guarded, but, in the light of 
C what Mr Ollerhead’s memorandum says about Mr Poynter having to rely on Mr Coull 
on HSEQ matters, this may reflect the reality. 


97. Mr Jones does not say that he made the decision alone. As Managing Director 
of Total UK Ltd, he no doubt had considerable authority, but the affidavit does not 
state what roles, if any, were played by others in the company, in particular members 
of the Board, on 12 December when the decision to set up the AIT was taken, or 
what part was played by the French parent company at that time. There is evidence 
of initial contact with people from the French parent company and Davies Arnold 
Cooper advised Total’s French lawyers on 12 December. Since what is relevant is 
the purpose of Total UK and Total Downstream Oil Storage Ltd. at the time the AIT 
E was established on 12 December, these are matters which are relevant and which 

should have been addressed. Mr Jones states (in paragraph 12) that at that time they 
were working ‘mainly through oral communication’, which suggests there were 
some documents, but he does not refer to any document other than the Ollerhead 
memoranda which he mistakenly (see below) considered were privileged. 


98. Mr Jones may not have told Mr Ollerhead of his purpose, or Mr Ollerhead 
may have misunderstood what he was told. There is, however, no explanation of 
how a misunderstanding by Mr Ollerhead may have come about, or whether it was 
shared by others within Total. The affidavit does not state whether Mr Jones told Mr 
Ollerhead or anyone in Total UK or the group what his purpose was and whether that 

G was the corporate purpose. Mr Jones states that Mr Poynter and (after 21 December) 
DLA Piper reported to him in respect of the AIT’s progress. There is, however, no 
explanation of why, if the dominant purpose was to prepare for contemplated legal 
proceedings and Mr Ollerhead’s understanding of the purpose of the investigation 
was wrong, Mr Poynter, who was copied in to all the emails, did not correct him. 


99. Mr Jones states in paragraphs 13 and 15 of his first affidavit that, but for 
the contemplation of litigation, the Total AIT would not have been set up. The 
affidavit states that he had no regard to any internal Total procedure and that the one 
day and ten day reports required by element 5 of the Safety Management System 
were not produced. It is not explained whether he was not aware of the mandatory 
requirements in place under the Application Guide or whether he decided not to use

(Beatson J) 


them, or why the required reports were not produced. There is no explanation in A 
either of his affidavits as to why no account was taken of the lesson-learning culture 
expressed in the Application Guide and other documents and how this fits with, for 
example, the section on ‘Lessons from Buncefield’ in Total’s Environment and Social 
Responsibility Report 2006. The legitimacy within the Total corporate structure of 
the Managing Director having no regard to procedures described as mandatory which 
have specified “lesson learning’ purposes is not explained. There is also no explanation 
of the difference with the DAC letter which refers to Total’s internal requirements and 
does not suggest that, but for the legal proceedings contemplated, no AIT would have 
been set up. The affidavit is thus, at a minimum, incomplete on matters which it is 
necessary for the court to know in order to determine the claim to privilege. 


100. Paragraph 12 of Mr Jones’s affidavit can only be understood as a claim of 
privilege in relation to documents concerning the setting up of the AIT. As Lord 
Grabiner recognised at the hearing, there is no ground for such a claim. Lord Grabiner 
gave an undertaking that Total would look for and disclose other documents in this 
class. However, Mr Jones’s affidavit shows a misapprehension as to the extent of any 
privilege to which Total is entitled which requires elucidation. 


101. Having concluded that the affidavits are not satisfactory, the question is what 
order should be made. I have said that they do not enable me to conclude that the 
claim for privilege is established. I have considered whether this means that the Total 
defendants have not satisfied the burden of proof and that I should order inspection of E 
the documents. The affidavits do not disclose all that they ought to disclose. However, 
in the light of Mr Jones’s unequivocal statements as to his purpose and the time some 
of TAV’s evidence was served (Mr Poynter’s email — paragraph 16 above — referring 
to what Total’s parent company would require was produced during the hearing) this 
would not be appropriate. I have decided that, having regard to the decisions such 
as Birmingham and Motor Omnibus Co Ltd v London and North Western Railway 
Co, Ankin v L & NE Railway Co, and National Westminster Bank plc v Rabobank 
Nederland, Mr Jones should be ordered to swear a further affidavit to deal with the 
matters which the earlier affidavits do not cover or on which they are unsatisfactory. 
As to cross-examination, for the reasons I have given, on the assumption there is 
jurisdiction to order cross-examination in this context, I do not consider this is an G 
appropriate case for doing so. 


The applications in respect of the HOSL AIT 


102. IT have referred to the abandonment of the applications in respect of HOSL and 
Mr Richard Jones, and said that they were unsustainable. The documents had not been 
requested from HOSL prior to the application. Nor were HOSL’s solicitors contacted 
on the issue. As in the case of Mr Malcolm Jones, there was no formal application to 
cross-examine him supported by evidence as required by the CPR. Since TAV’s case 
was in effect that Mr Jones’ affidavit should not be believed, a serious allegation, it 
should have been made by application supported by the evidence on which it was

QB West London Pipeline v Total UK 295 
(Beatson J) 


A proposed to rely. The supporting material on which TAV relied was in fact served only 
on 4 July, very shortly before the hearing. 


103. There was nothing in the material before the court which cast doubt on the 
affidavits sworn on behalf of HOSL by Mr Richard Jones and Mr Young. In view of 
HOSL’s status, the existence of the HSC’s Buncefield Major Incident Investigation 
Board and Total’s Accident Inspection Team’s investigations, it was unsurprising that 
HOSL’s dominant purpose in setting up its accident investigation team was to assist 
HOSL’s legal advisers in advising it in relation to contemplated civil and criminal 
proceedings. Although a number of other points were relied on in TAV’s written 
submissions, at the hearing its case that the HOSL investigation was also for lesson- 
C learning purposes rested on HOSL having held itself out to the competent authority as 
the operator of the site and was therefore under a duty under the COMAH Regulations 
to investigate incidents and near misses. Mr Young’s affidavit, which is unchallenged, 
addresses this issue. Moreover, Mr Young was at the relevant board meetings and 
advised the board. His evidence is that the sole purpose of setting up the HOSL AIT 
was to assist in relation to contemplated criminal and civil proceedings. His evidence 
is not challenged. The application to cross-examine Mr Richard Jones thus falls at 
the first hurdle. 


104. There were other fundamental difficulties in the application. I have dealt 
with the position as to cross-examination in relation to an affidavit as to disclosure 
E including one claiming privilege, elsewhere in this judgment. In the case of HOSL, 
cross-examination would have been wholly inappropriate for two reasons. First, 
in the light of the close involvement of the lawyers in the decision to establish the 
HOSL AIT, it would be difficult to examine Mr Jones without straying into the legal 
advice Eversheds gave the HOSL board. Secondly, a major issue in the litigation is 
whether Total or HOSL were the operators of the site for the purposes of the COMAH 
regulations. It is established that it is inappropriate to deal with such a matter at an 
interlocutory stage on the basis of limited evidence. In any event, as I have observed, 
Mr Young’s affidavit addresses the Regulations point and states that there was no 
suggestion that the HOSL AIT should be set up for the purposes of the COMAH 
regulations or pursuant to any internal procedures. 


Conclusion 


105. In the light of what is stated in paragraphs 95-101 of this judgment, the 
appropriate course is to require a further affidavit to be sworn by Mr Malcolm Jones 
dealing with the matters which his earlier affidavits do not cover or on which they are 
unsatisfactory. I shall hear submissions as to the time within which this is to be done. 
If the gaps and inadequacies are not addressed, it is difficult to see that the burden of 
proof that lies on a person claiming privilege will have been satisfied.

PROTECTIVE ORDER 


Upon a showing of good cause in support of the entry of a protective order to 
protect the discovery and dissemination of confidential information or information which 
will improperly annoy, embarrass, or oppress any party, witness, or person providing 
discovery in this case, IT IS ORDERED: 

1, This Protective Order shall apply to all documents, materials, and information, 
including without limitation, documents produced, answers to interrogatories, 
responses to requests for admission, deposition testimony, and other 
information disclosed pursuant to the disclosure or discovery duties created by 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 

a As used in this Protective Order, “document” is defined as provided in 
FED.R.CIV.P. 34(a). A draft or non-identical copy is a separate document 


within the meaning of this term. 





Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 39-1 Filed 03/02/16 Page 3 of 7 


Information designated “CONFIDENTIAL” shall be information that is 
confidential and implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of (a) 
plaintiff Virginia Roberts Giuffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine Maxwell. 
CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose 
except the preparation and trial of this case. 

CONFIDENTIAL documents, materials, and/or information (collectively 

“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION”) shall not, without the consent of the 

party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed except that such 

information may be disclosed to: 

a. attorneys actively working on this case; 

b. persons regularly employed or associated with the attorneys actively 
working on this case whose assistance is required by said attorneys in the 
preparation for trial, at trial, or at other proceedings in this case; 

c. the parties; 

d. expert witnesses and consultants retained in connection with this 
proceeding, to the extent such disclosure is necessary for preparation, trial 
or other proceedings in this case; 

e. the Court and its employees (“Court Personnel’) in this case; 

f. stenographic reporters who are engaged in proceedings necessarily incident 
to the conduct of this action; 


g. deponents, witnesses, or potential witnesses; and 





Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 39-1 Filed 03/02/16 Page 4 of 7 


h. other persons by written agreement of the parties. 

Prior to disclosing any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any person 
listed above (other than counsel, persons employed by counsel, Court 
Personnel and stenographic reporters), counsel shall provide such person with 
a copy of this Protective Order and obtain from such person a written 
acknowledgment stating that he or she has read this Protective Order and 
agrees to be bound by its provisions. All such acknowledgments shall be 
retained by counsel and shall be subject to in camera review by the Court if 
good cause for review is demonstrated by opposing counsel. 

Documents are designated as CONFIDENTIAL by placing or affixing on them 
(in a manner that will not interfere with their legibility) the following or other 
appropriate notice: “CONFIDENTIAL.” Discovery material designated 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be identified by Bates number. To the extent practical, 
the respective legend shall be placed near the Bates number. 

Designation of a document as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall 
constitute a representation that such document has been reviewed by an 
attorney for the designating party, that there is a valid and good faith basis for 
such designation, made at the time of disclosure or production to the receiving 
party, and that disclosure of such information to persons other than those 
permitted access to such material would cause a privacy harm to the 


designating party.

Whenever a deposition involves the disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION, the deposition or portions thereof shall be designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall be subject to the provisions of this Protective 
Order. Such designation shall be made on the record during the deposition 
whenever possible, but a party may designate portions of depositions as 
CONFIDENTIAL after transcription, provided written notice of the 
designation is promptly given to all counsel of record within thirty (30) days 
after notice by the court reporter of the completion of the transcript, and until 
the expiration of such thirty (30) days after notice by the court reporter of the 
completion of the transcript, no party or counsel for any such party may share 
the contents of the deposition outside the limitations of this Protective Order. 
Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be 
accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic 
Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of New York. 

A party may object to the designation of particular CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION by giving written notice to the party designating the disputed 
information. The written notice shall identify the information to which the 
objection is made. If the parties cannot resolve the objection within ten (10) 
business days after the time the notice is received, it shall be the obligation of 


the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL to file an

appropriate motion requesting that the Court determine whether the disputed 
information should be subject to the terms of this Protective Order. If such a 
motion is timely filed, the disputed information shall be treated as 
CONFIDENTIAL under the terms of this Protective Order until the Court rules 
on the motion. If the designating party fails to file such a motion within the 
prescribed time, the disputed information shall lose its designation as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall not thereafter be treated as CONFIDENTIAL in 
accordance with this Protective Order. In connection with a motion filed under 
this provision, the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL shall 
bear the burden of establishing that good cause exists for the disputed 
information to be treated as CONFIDENTIAL. 

At the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each 
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be returned to the party that designated it 
CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL 
documents. Where the parties agree to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, 
the destroying party shall provide all parties with an affidavit confirming the 
destruction. 

This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on the use of any 


CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this matter.

INTRODUCTION 

This Court has inherent authority to control the order, means and method of discovery in 
an action to promote fairness and justice between the parties. 

Here, Defendant properly served discovery requests for Plaintiff, due on March 16, and 
thereafter accepted a deposition date of March 25, after the discovery responses and document 
productions were due so that she would properly have time to review the documents and prepare 
her client for her deposition. 

Following the scheduling of the deposition, Plaintiff failed to (a) properly and timely 
respond to interrogatories and a request for production of documents due before the deposition 
date, (b) improperly asserted privileges and objections for which she has no good faith basis, and 
(c) failed to properly disclose matters subject to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1). Plaintiff touted to this 
Court her “thousands of pages” produced in response to the discovery requests, but upon closer 
inspection, that production is essentially empty: it consists largely of numerous copies of 
lengthy transcripts, and defendant’s pleadings in this case, which are not responsive to any 
discovery request. Now Plaintiff has stated her intent to produce thousands more pages on the 
eve of Ms. Maxwell’s deposition, knowing that her counsel will have insufficient time to review 
the materials, show them to their client, and use them to properly prepare her for her deposition. 
Plaintiff's counsel clearly hopes to ambush Ms. Maxwell at her deposition, either by showing her 
a document that she has not had a chance to review, or by making her look foolish on videotape 
for not remembering the contents of documents that relate back to witnesses and events 
occurring more than 17 years ago. 

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are designed to preclude such litigation by ambush 


and surprise. Plaintiff has articulated no good reason, nor any reason at all, why the deposition 


cannot be held in 2-3 weeks’ time, after proper Responses & Objections are produced, after her 
key documents in this case have been produced, after privilege issues have been resolved, and 
after counsel has had an opportunity to review the documents and to properly prepare their client 
for her deposition. Plaintiff has created the problem by failing to timely produce interrogatory 
responses, documents and her Rule 26 disclosures. She should not be rewarded for gaming the 
system. 

Rule 26(c) permits the Court to issue, for good cause, a protective order in order to 
“protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or 
expense” by “specifying terms, including time and place...for the disclosure or discovery” 
and/or “prescribing a discovery method other than the one selected by the party seeking 
discovery.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1)(B) & (C). Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to adjourn her 
deposition until mid-April so that the above-listed discovery issues can be properly resolved in 
advance of that time. 

Certificate of Conferral 

Counsel has conferred numerous times regarding the issues contained herein, most 
recently in a one hour and 45 minute phone call on March 21, 2016. Although Plaintiff has 
promised to supplement her production, revise her Responses & Objections, and to withdraw 
some of her privilege assertions, sign her Interrogatories and Objections and to consult with her 
client and her client’s other attorneys as to whether she can produce other information (like her 
client’s current address), Plaintiff refuses to postpone the deposition of Ms. Maxwell for even the 
period of time it would take for her to make complete disclosures. Therefore, defense counsel 
believes that their obligations pursuant to Rule 26(c) as well as this Court’s directive of March 


17, 2016, have been fulfilled. 


Procedural Background 


Ms. Maxwell served her First Discovery Requests on Plaintiff on February 12, 2016. 
Responses were thus due by March 16, 2016. Thereafter, counsel conferred regarding deposition 
dates for Ms. Maxwell and two other witnesses. It was on February 20, 2016 that defense 
counsel proposed that she could be available for Ms. Maxwell’s deposition in New York on 
either March 24 or March 25, 2016, anticipating that discovery responses would timely be 
provided 8-9 days prior to the deposition. Declaration of Laura A. Menninger In Support of 
Motions (“Menninger Decl.) Ex. E. The parties kept that date open, though Ms. Maxwell 
repeatedly reiterated the need for a protective order prior to the deposition. 

Three weeks passed, and it was not until March 8, that Plaintiffs counsel wrote a letter 
claiming that she would not be able to timely produce all responsive documents. In that letter, 
she expressed her desire to produce documents on a “rolling basis,” to be completed on or about 
April 15, 2016. Defense counsel responded saying that would be fine, however, Ms. Maxwell’s 
deposition should then be postponed until after the document production was complete. Defense 
counsel proposed dates as early as mid-April for the continued deposition. Menninger Decl. 

Ex. I. Plaintiff disagreed and she filed a motion seeking permission from the Court to (a) 
produce her documents over the course of a month but (b) keep Ms. Maxwell’s deposition on 
March 25, 2016, despite her incomplete and untimely production, and incorrectly stating that Ms. 
Maxwell had demanded she “cancel” her deposition. (Doc. # 59 at 3) 

On March 16, 2016, Plaintiff served Response and Objections to Defendant’s First Set of 
Discovery Requests and provided 3,190 pages of documents. The next day, argument was heard 
by this Court concerning, inter alia, Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Serve Production on a 
Rolling Basis. During that argument, Plaintiff's counsel represented a number of times to this 


Court the supposed breadth of her production the night before and minimized the number of 


3 


outstanding documents there remained to be produced. See Transcript of March 17, 2016 
Hearing (“Tr.”) at 12:7-10 (“We produced 3,000 pages last night. We are continuing that 
production. We are moving as fast as we can. We produced a privilege log with over 134 
entries on it.”); id. at 15:21 (“Like I said, we produced 3,000 pages yesterday.”); id. at 17:5 (“I 
produced 3,000 pages”). She also offered to produce any documents that she intended to “use” 
at the March 25 deposition. 

Counsel engaged in a conferral on March 21, 2016, regarding the deficiencies in 
Plaintiffs document production, the improper privileges and objections, and her incomplete Rule 
26 disclosures. During conferral, Plaintiff's counsel conceded that many of her objections and 
assertions of privilege were improper and that her responses failed to adhere to Rule 
34(b)(2)(C)’s requirement that she state whether she has withheld documents. Counsel for 
Plaintiff stated she will “supplement” her Response and Objections and will provide numerous 
additional documents in the coming days and weeks. As to other categories of documents, 
Plaintiff demanded that she be provided with legal authority to support the request, and as to 
others, she stated her need to confer with her client and her client’s other attorneys before even 
knowing whether she had or could respond to the requests. 

As of the date of this Motion, three days prior to the deposition, no additional documents 
have been produced. Defense counsel will be traveling to New York tomorrow for the court 


appearance on Thursday. 


ARGUMENT 
I. PLAINTIFF PROPOUNDED IMPROPER RESPONSES, OBJECTIONS AND 
PRIVILEGES TO DEFENDANT’S DISCOVERY REQUESTS IN ORDER TO 
AVOID TIMELY PRODUCING DOCUMENTS PRIOR TO DEFENDANT’S 
DEPOSITION 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests included 14 interrogatories and 37 document 
requests. Because Plaintiff stated yesterday her intent to amend her Response & Objections and 
to supplement her discovery, a Motion to Compel pursuant to Rule 37 is premature. However, 
this Court can and should consider Plaintiff's deficient Response & Objections in deciding 
whether or not a deposition of Ms. Maxwell should proceed without the benefit of legally sound 


and appropriate responses to interrogatories and document production. 


A. Plaintiff interposed improper objections to — and failed to even answer most 
— interrogatories. 


Plaintiff requested of this Court leave to produce documents on a rolling basis. She made 
no such request with respect to her Interrogatory Responses, and thus, one can presume, she 
believes her Interrogatory Responses of March 16, 2016, to be complete. They are not. 

The Responses are not signed by Plaintiff, nor are the Objections signed by Ms. 
McCawley. See Rule 33(b)(5); Menninger Decl. at Ex. A. “The plaintiff apparently 
misinterprets the Federal Rules as optional. They are not. Rule 33(b)(5) could not be more 
clear: “The person who makes the answers must sign them, and the attorney who objects must 
sign any objection. This requirement is critical because “interrogatories serve not only as a 
discovery device but as a means of producing admissible evidence; there is no better example of 
an admission of a party opponent, which is admissible because it is not hearsay, than an answer 
to an interrogatory.’” Walls v. Paulson, 250 F.R.D. 48 (D.D.C. 2008) (sanctioning Plaintiff for 


failure to sign interrogatories) (internal citations omitted). 


Plaintiff refused to answer at all Interrogatory Nos. 5-14. Id. at 10-17. With respect to 
Interrogatory Nos. 1-4, she gave incomplete and partial answers. Jd. at 5-10. Her assertions of 
privilege track the same nonsensical bases as she used in Response to the Requests for 
Production of Documents, discussed more fully below.’ By way of example, again, she 
propounds the same assertion of all possible privileges, and completely refuses to answer, in 
response to Interrogatories seeking: 


e Her and her attorneys’ communications with journalists, media organizations, and 
publishers (Interrog. No. 5). 


e Any employment she has had since 1996, including the names and contact 
information for her employers, the dates of her employment, and her titles and 
income from such employment (Interrog. No. 9). 
e Income she has received apart from employment (Interrog. No. 10). 
e Facts in support of her claims for lost wages (Interrog. No. 11). 
e Her past and current treating physicians and psychiatrists (Interrog. No. 12, 13). 
Most egregiously, Plaintiff refused to answer interrogatories which strike at the heart of 
her allegations. Ms. Maxwell interposed Interrogatories concerning which “false statements” 


attributed to Ms. Maxwell were “published globally” as contended in paragraph 9 of Count 1 of 


the Complaint (Interrog. No. 6) and whether Plaintiff has been defamed by anyone other than 





' Plaintiff additionally asserts that no interrogatories are permitted pursuant to Local Rule 33.3 


prior to the last 30 days of discovery. See Menninger Decl. Ex. A. Her objection is unfounded, 
as defense counsel explained to her by letter of February 20, 2016. /d.at Ex. D. First, many of 
the interrogatories sought, consistent with Local Rule 33.3(a), the names of witnesses and the 
custodians of records, such as her treating physicians, her employers, her attorneys, as well as the 
bases for her computation of damages, such as any employment income, non-employment 
income and facts supporting her claim for lost wages. Second, Local Rule 33.3(b) authorizes, 
“during discovery,” interrogatories which “are a more practical method of obtaining the 
information sought than a request for production or deposition. The remainder of the 
interrogatories propounded fall within this category — the kind of minutiae that Plaintiff is 
unlikely to “recall” at the time of her deposition, such as all cellphone numbers she has used, the 
dates she and her attorneys communicated with the media, etc. Plaintiff’s blanket assertion of 
Local Rule 33.3 is clearly interposed in bad faith.

Ms. Maxwell (Interrog. No. 7). Both of these requests are standard requests in a defamation suit 
and directly relate to the liability and damages claimed by Plaintiff. Plaintiff refused, claiming 
the laundry-privilege list and stating that the “information is in the possession of Defendant who 
has failed to comply with her production obligations.” 

Likewise, Plaintiff refused to identify, in advance of Ms. Maxwell’s deposition or ever, 
the individuals to whom Plaintiff claims Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficked her. Interrogatory No. 
8 asked her to specify the individuals referred to generally in her Florida CVRA pleading that 
were the supposed participants of the alleged sexual trafficking, “including numerous prominent 
American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime 
Minister and other world leaders.” Plaintiff refused, claiming every applicable privilege, and 
additionally “because naming some such individuals would jeopardize her physical safety based 
on credible threats to the same (sic).””» Menninger Decl. Ex. A at 12-13. Does that mean that 
Plaintiff's counsel does not intend to ask about these world leaders during Ms. Maxwell’s 
deposition? Does it mean that Ms. Maxwell’s statements to the press that Plaintiff's claims 
regarding world leaders were “obvious lies” cannot be tested for their truth or falsity during this 
litigation? Or by failing to name these individuals does Plaintiff seek to use the deposition as a 
fishing expedition as to any famous person Ms. Maxwell has ever met? 

Plaintiff has brought a lawsuit claiming her allegations about Ms. Maxwell are true, now 
she doesn’t even want to say what her allegations are, or she wants to wait and try to conform her 
proof to sometime after Ms. Maxwell is deposed. There is no excuse for these untimely, 
improper and incomplete responses, and fairness dictates that the answers be provided in 


advance of defendant’s deposition. Kolenc v. Bellizzi, No. 95 CIV. 4494 (LMM KNF), 1999 WL 


92604, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 1999) (‘Failure to respond timely to a party’s request for 
documents results in a waiver of all objections which could have been seasonably asserted.”’). 


B. Plaintiff propounded inapplicable Privileges, Responses & Objections to the 
Request for Production of Documents. 


1. Plaintiff asserted inapplicable privileges. 

As discussed during oral argument before this Court on March 17, Plaintiff's counsel 
interposed every single possible objection to every single discovery request, without regard to 
whether that privilege was applicable to the specific request. Such a blanket objection amounts 
to no objection at all. Johnson v. Kraft Foods North America, Inc., 236 F.R.D.535, 538 (D. Kan. 
2006) (a general objection which objects to a discovery request “to the extent” it may apply is 
tantamount to asserting no objection at all as it makes “no meaningful effort to show the 
application of any such theoretical objection to any request for discovery.”). Plaintiff responded 
to each and every of the thirty-seven (37) Requests for Production of Documents with the 
following privilege assertion: “Ms. Giuffre objects to this request in that it seeks information 
that is protected by the attorney-client, work product, joint defense, investigative, spousal and 
other applicable privileges.” See Menninger Decl. Ex. A.” Among the type of items to which 
Plaintiff asserted these privileges: 

e Request No. 9 — “Any Documents reflecting rental agreements or purchase 
agreements for residential addresses identified by You in response to 
Interrogatory No. 1.” 

e Request No. 10 —“All Documents relating to Your Employment and/or 


association with the Mar-A-Lago Club located in Palm Beach, FL, including any 
application for Employment.” 


°* Today at 3:15 p.m. EST, Plaintiff served “Supplemental Response and Objections to 


Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests.” The new version does not indicate where, if any, 
supplements were provided and a cursory review does not reveal any. Counsel will be prepared 
to address at the argument on Thursday whether any of these additions alter the arguments 
presented herein. 


e Request No. 21 — “All Documents relating to Your driver’s license from 1998- 
2002.” 


e Request No. 22 —“A copy of Your marriage license(s) from 1999 to present.” 
e Request No. 24 —“All Documents concerning Your employment in Australia, 


including, but not limited to employment applications, pay stubs, Documents 
reflecting Your Income including any tax Documents.” 


There is simply no good faith basis to assert “attorney-client” or “work product” privileges to 
documents such as a marriage license or employment records. 

Plaintiff added equally non-applicable privileges to other of her responses. For example, 
she claimed an “agency privilege,” “investigative privilege” and “accountant client privilege” 
with respect to Request No. 13 — “All Documents concerning any allegations of theft by You 
from the Roadhouse Grill in Palm Beach, Florida from 1999-2002.” A simple Westlaw search 
for “agency privilege” in New York and in the Second Circuit did not reveal that one exists, 
certainly not for an individual rather than an “agency”. Nor is an “investigative privilege” a 
recognized privilege. See Lyman v. Felter, No. 1:12-CV-530 MAD/RFT, 2015 WL 1415270, at 
*3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:12-CV-530 
MAD/DEP, 2015 WL 3549667 (N.D.N.Y. June 8, 2015) (chastising a pro se plaintiff for 
assertion of non-applicable privileges such as the “investigative” privilege). Further, “New York 
does not recognize an accountant-client privilege.” Jn re Waterscape Resort LLC, No. 11-11593 
(SMB), 2014 WL 302856, at *3 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2014). But that did not stop Plaintiff 
from asserting this privilege in response to a request for her tax returns, Request No. 14. 

Because Plaintiff asserted privileges that do not exist under New York or federal law, and 
asserted privileges that clearly do not apply to certain documents, her assertions cannot have 
been propounded in good faith. See Jones v. J.C. Penny’s Dep ’t Stores, Inc., 228 F.R.D. 190, 


201 (W.D.N.Y. 2005) (concluding that the plaintiff and her attorney engaged in bad faith and 


willful misconduct in conducting discovery, warranting sanctions, where, among other things, 
counsel “merely asserted a general objection to the production [of a relevant] file based on the 
attorney-client privilege lacking any colorable basis.”). Such improper assertions of privilege 
amount to a waiver of any applicable privilege. SEC v. Yorkville Advisors, LLC, No. 12 Civ. 
7728 (GBD)(HBP), 2015 WL 855796, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2015) (holding that plaintiffs 
unjustified failure to serve indices of privileged documents in a timely and proper manner 
operated as a waiver of any applicable privilege.) 
2. Plaintiff interposed inapplicable objections. 

Plaintiff also interposed equally inapplicable objections to her responses to document 
requests. For example, Plaintiff asserted: 

e Response to Requests No. 5, 7, 8, 21, 25 — “Ms. Giuffre objects to this request in 
that documents responsive to this request are within the possession, custody and 
control of the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein with whom she claims a joint defense 
privilege and defendant has refused to produce responsive documents to Ms. 
Giuffre’s request seeking communications between the Defendant and Ms. 


Giuffre and between Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Giuffre.” 


e Response to Request No. 6 - “Defendant has documents responsive to this request 
that she should produce.” 


e Response to Request No. 16, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34 — “Ms. Giuffre objects to this 
request to the extent it seeks proprietary and copyright protected materials.” 

It is well-settled that a party may not object to a discovery request on the grounds that she 
thinks the other party “already has the materials,” nor is there any legal authority for saying that 
because a party thinks a third party has the same materials, they do not have to produce it and the 
requesting party must secure them elsewhere. Nor does Plaintiff have a good faith basis to assert 


a “copyright” or “proprietary protection” for her “diary, calendar and journal” that she sold to a 


10 


news organization, Radar Online,? or a book deal that she is attempting to sell (or has sold) to a 
publisher, regarding her allegations at issue in this Complaint. Resp. to Req. No. 32. 

These responses, like Plaintiff's assertions of privilege, were interposed in bad faith. 

Js Plaintiff failed to state whether she was withholding documents 

Rule 34(b)2)(C), as amended December 2, 2015, now requires that “an objection must 
state whether any responsive materials are being withheld on the basis of that objection. An 
objection to part of a request must specify the part and permit inspection of the rest.” Despite the 
clear requirements of the rule, Plaintiff interposed numerous objections and then failed 
repeatedly to state whether she was withholding any documents on the basis of any particular 
objection or to permit discovery of the un-objected to portions of the request. 

For example, in Response to Request No. 1, Plaintiff interposed objections based on 
Local Rule 33.3, the numerous privileges listed above, the request was “overly broad,” “seeks to 
invade the privacy rights of a sex abuse victims (sic),” and “is meant for the improper purpose of 
harassing and intimidating this victim.” Then Plaintiff stated that “subject to the forgoing 
objections,” she is producing 3,190 documents and will continue to supplement this production, 
but “is withholding documents based on her objections.” Additionally adding to the confusion, 
Plaintiff repeatedly states that she either “has produced non-privileged documents” or she “does 
not have any non-privileged documents”, but fails to say whether she is withholding any 
“privileged” documents, which Rule 34 clearly requires her to state. It is absolutely impossible 


to tell from Plaintiff's responses whether (a) she is persisting in any particular objection, (b) 





Compare Response to Request No. 16 — “Any diary, journal or calendar concerning Your 
activities between 1996-2002” with “Diary of Virginia Roberts Who Claims She Had Sex With 
Prince Andrew Reveals Details,” Daily Mail.com (Jan. 13, 2015), 
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2908852/Teen-diary-belonging-woman-claims- 
underage-sex-Prince-Andrew-reveals-explicit-details-night-London.html (last accessed March 
20, 2016). 





11 


persisting in any particular privilege, (c) she placed responsive documents on a privilege log, (d) 
what grounds she asserts for withholding documents, and (e) which portion is being disclosed 
and which portion withheld. See also Responses to Requests No. 2, 3, 4, 

The Advisory Committee Notes reflecting the 2015 amendment to Rule 34 provide that 
“[t]his amendment should end the confusion that frequently arises when a producing party states 
several objections and still produces information, leaving the requesting party uncertain whether 
any relevant and responsive information has been withheld on the basis of the objections.” Far 
from ending the confusion, Plaintiff’s responses amplify it. 

I. PLAINTIFF’S INTERROGATORY RESPONSES AND 3,190 PAGE 
PRODUCTION CONTAINED ALMOST NONE OF THE REQUESTED 
ANSWERS OR DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING KEY DOCUMENTS FOR THIS 
CASE 
Plaintiff stated over and over during Court that she had made a good-faith production of 

thousands of pages of documents and therefore could be excused for not having timely produced 

all of the requested documents, nor would Ms. Maxwell suffer prejudice in going forward with 
her deposition in the absence of a timely production. 

After having had a chance to review the 3,190 page document production, however, it is 
clear that it contains almost none of the requested documents, but rather is filled with multiple 
copies of a few lengthy deposition transcripts, pleadings in this case, and other similarly non- 
responsive documents. Plaintiff has simply inflated her document production to make it look 
like she did a thorough job of reviewing and producing documents, when the opposite is true. To 
wit: 

e Juan Alessi deposition (139 pages), produced twice. 
e Alfredo Rodriguez deposition (68 pages), produced thrice 


e Palm Beach police reports (redacted), (89 pages), produced twice 


12 


e Sarah Kellen deposition (116 pages), produced once 

e Nadia Marcincova deposition (50 pages), produced once 
e Message book (185 pages) 

e Flight logs (138 pages), produced twice 

e Photos (21 pages), produced four times. 


Thus, the same eight documents account for more than half of the total production. 

More telling are the documents that Plaintiff failed to produce, including documents that 
are key to this case. Plaintiff contends that Ms. Maxwell began her “campaign to discredit” her 
following her December 30, 2014 pleading in the U.S. District Court in which she attempted to 
join the Crime Victims’ Rights Act lawsuit there. Indeed, that is the pleading in which some of 
Plaintiff's most outlandish claims were first set forth, and that pleading preceded by three days 
Ms. Maxwell’s denial of Plaintiffs allegations. Yet Plaintiff has not even produced an 
unredacted copy of the pleading setting forth her allegations about Ms. Maxwell. Instead, she 
produced a redacted copy in which the allegations about Ms. Maxwell and the legions of famous 
people to whom she claims Ms. Maxwell trafficked her are blacked out. They were blacked out 
in response to Judge Marra’s Order which struck those allegations as “impertinent” but does 
Plaintiff and her counsel not even possess an unredacted version? Plaintiff wants to take the 
deposition of Ms. Maxwell concerning her denial of a statement that Plaintiff won’t even provide 
in advance. 

Other documents that Plaintiff has failed to timely produce include: 


e Her own deposition testimony in the defamation suit between her counsel and 
Alan Dershowitz, in which she no doubt discussed Ms. Maxwell 


e Her fee agreements with her counsel 


e Her communications with Mr. Epstein and with Ms. Maxwell 


13 


e Her employment records with Mar-A-Lago (which is where she claimed she met 
Ms. Maxwell when she was 14, or 15 or 16, depending on her various versions of 
events). 


e Her education records (reflecting not only whether she was in school when she 
was a 14-16 year old) but also reflective of her potential future earnings. 


e Her travel records (which might help refute her claims that she was sexually 
trafficking incidents abroad). 


e Her confidential settlement agreement with Mr. Epstein. 


Plaintiff now agrees that she will look for some of these documents and produce them at 
some time in the future, presumably after her deposition of Ms. Maxwell. 


I. PLAINTIFF FAILED TO TIMELY AND PROPERLY MAKE DISCLOSURES 
PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 26 


As detailed in the simultaneously filed pleading, Plaintiff has failed to properly make 
disclosures pursuant to Rule 26(a)(1). While these disclosures may not directly impact the 
subject matter of Defendant’s depositions, they demonstrate the bad-faith of Plaintiff in fulfilling 
her discovery obligations and also, ultimately, may likely impact the discovery deadlines that 
have been set in this case. 

Plaintiff's argument to go forward on March 25, 2016, rather than some date in mid-April 
after her own disclosures and discovery responses are complete, is due to the “looming” fact 
discovery cut-off of July 1. Yet she has been denying Ms. Maxwell all the clearly disclosable 
items that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to in order to defend her case — the computation of damages 
and any supporting documentation, the names of medical professionals who can supposedly 
verify her past and future medical treatment needs, her prior wages (if any), her bases for 
claiming $30 million in non-economic damages. Plaintiff has admitted that some of the treating 


professionals she will be relying on live in Australia but said she couldn’t understand why we 


14 


thought we would need to take their depositions or that it might be difficult to get those 
depositions scheduled in the remaining 99 days of discovery. 

To the extent Plaintiff complains of difficulties in completing discovery as the basis for 
need to take Ms. Maxwell’s deposition on March 25 versus mid-April, the discovery deadlines 
are equally problematic for Defendant to complete discovery based on Plaintiffs lack of 
diligence and forthrightness in providing proper Rule 26 disclosures. 


IV. OTHER DISCOVERY ISSUES NOT YET RESOLVED INCLUDING PRIVILEGE 
BEFORE THIS DEPOSITION 


Based on this Court’s Order, Ms. Maxwell will be providing supplemental materials in 
support of her claims of privilege within the two week deadline established by this Court. 
Presumably there will be a ruling sometime shortly thereafter, and, should any additional 
documents be disclosed to Plaintiff, she will not have had access to those records on March 25. 

Similarly, Ms. Maxwell fully intends to submit a complete Motion to Compel regarding 
Plaintiffs deficient discovery responses should Plaintiff fail to withdraw improper objections 
and privileges, comply with the requirement that she state whether she is withholding 
documents, the deficiencies in Plaintiff's privilege log, and her incomplete and non-responsive 
Interrogatory responses. 


V. PLAINTIFF’S DISCOVERY TACTICS DESIGNED TO AMBUSH DEFENDANT 
AT HER DEPOSITION 


Plaintiff has been litigating the matters in this case since 2009, with cadres of expensive 
lawyers, and big law firms, behind her. Her lawyers have been working together to coordinate 
her media strategy, to make book deals, to give on-air interviews about Plaintiffs allegations, 
securing hundreds of thousands of dollars in media-money. Ms. Maxwell has not. She has not 
previously been a party to any criminal or civil litigation. Despite the years of litigation, here on 


the eve of her deposition, Plaintiff and her counsel are still sitting on thousands of pages of 


15 


documents representing Plaintiff’s version of events, statements taken by witnesses, 
communications to the press, which published false and defamatory statements about Ms. 
Maxwell, and they have interposed baseless, frivolous and frankly sanctionable privileges, 
discovery responses and have refused to even answer the most simple of interrogatories. Those 
discovery requests were due on March 16, and Plaintiff knew when she proposed the deposition 
date of March 25 that her discovery was due prior to that time. Three days before the deposition, 
she still has not rendered answers or provided documents that go to the heart of this case — what 
were her statements to the Florida court and to the press to which Ms. Maxwell was responding? 
What statements were false? To whom did Ms. Maxwell supposedly sexually traffic her? 

Plaintiff's gamesmanship is clear: she wants to get Ms. Maxwell on a videotaped 
deposition camera, show her documents that she has not had a chance to review either because 
they were not produced or because they were produced so late in the day buried amidst 
thousands of pages of meaningless discovery that her attorneys have not had the opportunity to 
review and to refresh her recollection. Or Plaintiffs want to ask Ms. Maxwell questions about 
events that occurred 17 years ago, while in possession of documents that would refresh her 
recollection but not show those to her, so that they can later spring them on her at trial and ask 
about her new refreshed memories. 

This is a discovery ambush and the Court should not permit it, certainly not when the 
discovery requests came first, and were propounded before the deposition date was set. 
VI. PLAINTIFF WILL SUFFER NO HARM BY POSTPONING DEPOSITION FOR 

2-3 WEEKS 

Notably absent from any of Plaintiff's pleadings or argument is the harm she would 


suffer by having to wait 2-3 weeks for a deposition delay caused by her own lack of diligence in 


16 


producing interrogatory responses and documents. There is none. No other witnesses 
depositions have now been scheduled, no other discovery requests are outstanding, no expert 


disclosures have been made. 


CONCLUSION 


Plaintiff's discovery responses are riddled with improper objections, non-existent 
privileges, failures to respond, failures to follow the basic requirements of the Rules, and her 
initial disclosures are the same. In a case where Plaintiff has made the most serious of 
allegations against Ms. Maxwell, that she is a sexual abuser and trafficker, she should be held to 
the requirements of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Allowing her to game the system, to sit on 
responsive documents, to evade providing the very allegations that she has decried Ms. Maxwell 
from denying, is to permit her the opportunity to try to game the system and ambush Ms. 
Maxwell at her videotaped deposition. Particularly in the absence of any articulated harm to 
postponing the deposition until she serves responsive answers, provides responsive documents 
and withdraws frivolous objections, a delay of defendant’s deposition for a period of 2-3 weeks 


will serve the interests of justice and fairness as well as the spirit of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

Re: — Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-07433-RWS 
Dear Ms. McCawley: 
I write in response to your letter of February 19, 2016. 


Rule 33.3, Local Rules for the Southern District of New York, permits interrogatories 
inter alia “during discovery...if they are a more practical method of obtaining the 
information sought than a request for production or inspection.” The interrogatories 
propounded on your client are just that and therefore not improper. By way of 
example, I seriously doubt that your client from memory will be able to recall each 
communication that she (and her many various attorneys) have had with law 
enforcement agencies or with representatives of the media, nor the names of her 
various health care providers, nor the sources and amounts of her income, dating back 
17 years or more. 


Indeed, numerous decisions by Judge Sweet have authorized the use of interrogatories 
during discovery. See, e.g., Ottoson v. SMBC Leasing & Finance, Inc., 2015 WL 
4597542, *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2015) (Sweet, J.); Hernandez v. Bare Burger Dio 
Inc., 2013 WL 3963660 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2013) (Sweet, J.). 


If you are taking the wholesale position that your client will refuse to respond to any 
interrogatories until June 2016, please advise me of that position by close of business 
next Wednesday, February 24, 2016, so that we may raise the issue with the Court if 
necessary. 


Finally, you object to the use of sub-parts in the 14 interrogatories propounded on 
your client. Your position is legally unfounded. The sub-parts utilized properly seek 
to clarify the meaning of “identify” with respect to the stated interrogatory. To the 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 65-4 Filed 03/22/16 Page 3 of 3 


Sigrid McCawley 
February 20, 2016 
Page 2 


extent that any such sub-part seeks a broader definition of “identify” than that 
permitted by Local Rule 26.3(c), you may construe the interrogatory in the narrower 
sense provided by that rule. See Local Rule 26.3(c) (defining the uniform meaning of 
“identify” with respect to persons and documents and requiring the “type,” date, 
addressee and recipient of documents or, alternatively, production of same and as to 
persons, the name, addresses and last known place of employment). 


Sincerely, 


HADDON, MORGAN AND FOREMAN, P.C.

Subject: Giuffre v. Maxwell - [Rule 26 Disclosures] 
Attachments: 2016.02.24 Def Initial FRCP 26(a)(1)(A) Disclosures.pdf 
Sigrid — 


Attached please find Ms. Maxwell’s Initial Disclosures Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1) in the above-captioned matter. 
Regarding Ms. Giuffre’s Rule 26 Disclosures served on November 11, 2015, they are deficient in several respects. 


First of all, you have not provided addresses and telephone numbers for witnesses listed therein. For example, as to 
witnesses Joanna Sjoberg and Jean Luc Brunel, you do not provide addresses or telephone numbers, yet you have served 
subpoenas on them or their counsel. Likewise, you do not even list Ms. Chambers as a witness, yet have apparently 
served a subpoena for her deposition as well. Cf. Rule 26(e)(1)(A) (requiring supplements “in a timely matter”). 


Furthermore, it is apparent from pleadings in other matters that you are in possession of a substantial number of 
documents regarding Ms. Giuffre’s claims and defenses that you have not mentioned, let alone provided copies of, 
consistent with Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii). By way of example only, your client has provided sworn testimony related to her

attorneys have provided redacted copies of her statements to law enforcement in that matter as well, yet you did not 
provide them as a part of your Rule 26 disclosures. 


Finally, Rule 26(a)(4)(A)(iii) requires you to provide a “computation of each category of damages” together with any 
“documents or other evidentiary material...on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the 
nature and extent of injuries suffered.” Your damages disclosures are woefully lacking. Although you list lump-sum 
total claims for damages, you do not provide a single “computation,” let alone any “documents or other evidence” 
supporting any “computation.” 


e Tothe extent Ms. Giuffre purports to have, for example, “physical, psychological and psychiatric injuries and 
resulting medical expenses,” totaling $100,000, you do not provide a computation nor any “medical expenses” 
or records of any such “injuries.” 

e To the extent Ms. Giuffre purports to have, for example, $30 MILLLION worth of “pain and suffering” and 
“mental anguish,” again you do not provide a computation nor any records reflecting any such “injuries.” 

e Tothe extent Ms. Giuffre claims to have “past and future lost wages” of $5 MILLION, you provide no 
computation nor any records reflecting such “lost wages.”

required in a plaintiff's initial disclosures pursuant to Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii), and requires both a dollar amount sought and

Sigrid — 
Attached please find Ms. Maxwell’s Initial Disclosures Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1) in the above-captioned matter. 
Regarding Ms. Giuffre’s Rule 26 Disclosures served on November 11, 2015, they are deficient in several respects. 


First of all, you have not provided addresses and telephone numbers for witnesses listed therein. For example, as to 
witnesses Joanna Sjoberg and Jean Luc Brunel, you do not provide addresses or telephone numbers, yet you have served 
subpoenas on them or their counsel. Likewise, you do not even list Ms. Chambers as a witness, yet have apparently 
served a subpoena for her deposition as well. Cf Rule 26(e)(1)(A) (requiring supplements “in a timely matter”). 


Furthermore, it is apparent from pleadings in other matters that you are in possession of a substantial number of 
documents regarding Ms. Giuffre’s claims and defenses that you have not mentioned, let alone provided copies of, 
consistent with Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii). By way of example only, your client has provided sworn testimony related to her 
allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the Edwards v Dershowitz matter that you have not provided. Your client’s other 
attorneys have provided redacted copies of her statements to law enforcement in that matter as well, yet you did not 
provide them as a part of your Rule 26 disclosures. 


Finally, Rule 26(a)(1)(A){(iii) requires you to provide a “computation of each category of damages” together with any

Subject: Giuffre v. Maxwell - [Rule 26 Disclosures] 

Sigrid: 


Please consider this a conferral pursuant to Rule 37(a)(1). 
It is apparent that you do not intend to timely and appropriately attend to your Rule 26 disclosure obligations. 


On February 24, two weeks ago, | first attempted to confer with you on this topic. | pointed out that you have numerous 
documents in your possession that you intend to use to support your claims and defenses, as evidenced by the fact that 
you repeatedly have attached documents to your public pleadings that you have not provided via disclosures. You did 
so as early as 3 months ago, but more recently last week. You also have contact information for witnesses that you have 
not updated, as evidenced by the fact that you have served individuals with subpoenas, one of whom is not even 
contained in your Rule 26 disclosures. And you have documents, like your client’s sworn testimony and statements to 
law enforcement, on the topics central to this case that you have not provided. 


Most significantly, you have not even attempted to provide the type of meaningful calculation of damages required by 
Rule 26: i.e., the $35 million you seek, encompassing a “lost wages” of $5 million (in the past year since the alleged 
“defamation”) and her “pain and suffering” of $30 million (also since January 2, 2015). You have not provided the 
names/identities of any health care providers or witnesses who can attest to any “pain and suffering” or “mental 
anguish.” 


On February 26, you “anticipate[d]” you might have updated disclosures “in the near future.” Yesterday, you 
“anticipated” having them by “early next week.” 


Rule 26(e), as you know, requires that supplements be provided “in a timely manner” when a party “learns that in some 
material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect.” | anticipate the documents, the contact 
information and calculations of damages are not new information to you that you just “learned.” Rather you have 
deliberately withheld them from production despite your obligations. 


You have filed public pleadings accusing Ms. Maxwell of “stonewalling” and deliberate stalling tactics. You have 
demanded depositions go forward on dates of your choosing. All the while, you have failed to fulfill your obligations to 
disclose documents, contact information and calculations of damages. 


Please provide complete and updated Rule 26 disclosures by close of business this Friday, including a representation as 
to when you “learned” any of the new information, or we will be forced to seek appropriate relief from the 

Court. Obviously, we will not proceed with any depositions in the absence of complete disclosures. | do not want to 
travel to Florida for witness depositions only to have you find “new” information about those witnesses as soon as the 
depositions have concluded. 


Thank you for your prompt attention.

Plaintiff Virginia L. Giuffre, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully submits this 
Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for Protective Order Regarding Defendant’s 
Deposition [D.E. 63]. For the reasons set forth below, this Court should deny Defendant’s motion 
in its entirety. 

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

Unfortunately, even after the Court’s strong words to the parties at the hearing last 
Thursday, March 17, 2016, Defendant continues to misrepresent basic facts in an effort to 
wrongfully postpone the deposition of the Defendant in this case. The facts are that Plaintiff 
issued a formal Notice of Deposition to the Defendant on February 2, 2016, well before Defendant 
issued her first set of discovery requests. Allowing the Defendant to dictate when she is deposed 
based on her dilatory discovery practices turns the Rules of Civil Procedure on their head. If this 
were the rule, then a defendant could continuously issue discovery requests to a plaintiff in order 
to postpone being deposed until the close of discovery. Such a ridiculous result is not 
contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 

More importantly, Defendant can claim no prejudice here because, as Plaintiff agreed to do 
at the hearing last Thursday, Plaintiff has provided the Defendant with a list of all the documents 
Plaintiff intends to use at the deposition on Friday, March 25, 2016, along with all the 
documents. See Declaration of Sigrid McCawley (“McCawley Decl.”) at Exhibit 1, March 22, 
2016 correspondence listing documents to be used at deposition. 

The parties participated in a meet and confer on Monday, March 21, 2016, that lasted close 
to two hours, during which Plaintiff made a number of concessions in order to avoid additional 
and unnecessary motion practice with this Court. Despite this, Defendant persists in trying to 
create issues with Plaintiff's discovery production and responses. Plaintiff served discovery 


requests back in October - four months ago - which still have not been properly responded to. At 


a minimum, she should be entitled to move discovery forward by taking the deposition of the 
Defendant. Indeed Local Rule 33.3 provides that rather than serving interrogatories, the parties 
should press discovery forward by seeking information through depositions. That is exactly what 
the Plaintiff is trying to do here and she is being stonewalled. Critical to this case is whether the 
Defendant is going to answer questions about her involvement in the alleged sexual trafficking 
and abuse of females or whether she is going to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights. Plaintiff 
should be entitled to answers, by way of a deposition, in order to shape her discovery going 
forward in this case. Discovery closes in three months and Plaintiff has not yet been able to 
depose the Defendant. That is simply wrong. 

Defendant, who has only produced two e-mails in response to Plaintiff's thirty-nine (39) 
discovery requests now complains that Plaintiff produced too many documents in response to 
Defendant’s expansive discovery requests. If Defendant did not want to receive responsive 
documents of that magnitude, she should have narrowly tailored her discovery requests. In fact, if 
anyone should be complaining about prejudice, it should be the Plaintiff who has only received 
two documents in Defendant’s discovery production. There is absolutely no valid reason that 
Defendant’s deposition should be postponed. 

ARGUMENT 

Despite engaging in a lengthy meet and confer call during which Plaintiff made a number 
of concessions in an effort to move this case forward, Defendant filed this baseless motion without 
acknowledging any of those concessions and instead relying on Plaintiff's original response, 
instead of her supplemental response, in an effort to convince the Court to postpone the 
Defendant’s deposition. Defendant misrepresents Plaintiff's discovery in this case in the 


following ways: 


Defendant’s Position: Defendant says Plaintiff lodged baseless objections and is 
withholding documents. 

Reality: Plaintiff produced non-privileged documents without withholding anything, 
except pictures of her minor children, in response to 34 of the 37 document requests and 
thus far has produced 4,134 pages of documents. 

Defendant’s Position: Defendant says Plaintiff should not have listed certain objections 
like “agency” or “investigative privilege.” 

Reality: Plaintiff agreed during the meet and confer to revise, and did in fact revise, her 
objections to narrow her objections and they now mirror exactly the Defendant’s privilege 
objections. Thus, Defendant has no basis for complaint. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2, 
Plaintiff's Supplemental Responses and Objections to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery 
Requests to Plaintiff. Plaintiff has asserted the “public interest privilege” to protect 
information she has regarding ongoing criminal investigations regarding the Defendant’s 
alleged sexual abuse. New York law “recognizes a public interest privilege which shields 
from disclosure information received by governmental entities where the public interest 
requires that such communications, or the sources thereof, should be kept confidential and 
not subject to the normal, liberal discovery rules.” Labarbera v. Ulster Cty. Soc'y for 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 277 A.D.2d 672, 673, 716 N.Y.S.2d 421, 422 (N.Y. 
App. Div. 2000) (citing Matter of World Trade Ctr. Bombing Litig., 93 N.Y .2d 1, 8, 686 
N.Y.S.2d 743, 709 N.E.2d 452 (N.Y. 1999); Matter of Klein v. Lake George Park Commn., 
261 A.D.2d 774, 689 N.Y.S.2d 782 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999)). 

Defendant’s Position: Defendant says Plaintiff should not reference in her objection that 


the Defendant has in its possession, custody and control the information being requested. 


Reality: Plaintiff preserved her objections because if Defendant had timely produced 
documents in this case, Plaintiff would have the material necessary to respond to the 
discovery request. There is no prejudice in asserting this objection because Plaintiff did 
not withhold documents based on this objection. 

Defendant’s Position: Defendant complains that Plaintiff asserted a copyright protection. 
Reality: Plaintiff did not withhold any documents based on her copyright protection 
assertion, but rather she marked any copyright material as such to preserve her rights, as 
she is entitled to do. 

Defendant’s Position: Defendant wrongly states that Plaintiff failed to state whether she 
was withholding documents. 

Reality: Plaintiff could not have been clearer — in accordance with Rule 34(b)(2)(c), 
Plaintiff clearly stated when she was withholding documents. For the small amount of 
documents she did withhold, she plainly stated that she is “withholding documents based 
on her objections.” Due to the concerns Defendant raised at the meet and confer about 
Defendant’s apparent confusion, Plaintiff went a step further and revised her answers to 
mirror the language that the Defendant used when she was withholding a documents. See 
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Original Responses and Objections, and Exhibit 4 
Supplemental Responses and Objections. Accordingly, there is no way Defendant can 
claim confusion. 

Defendant’s Position: Defendant, who only produced two emails in this case, complains 
that Plaintiff produced duplicate documents in her production of documents. 

Reality: In accordance with her obligations when dealing with electronic discovery, 
Plaintiff retained an electronic discovery and litigation support firm, Rational Retention, to 


assist with the forensic searching and producing of responsive electronic files in this case. 


Rational Retention performed, as part of their contract, de-duping services, which 
eliminates duplicates. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 5, Affidavit of Robert Conley from 
Rational Retention. As with any electronic discovery production, a document may appear 
to be a “duplicate” but if it has different metadata it must be produced. Defendant’s 
misguided argument that Plaintiff has artificially inflated the volume of her document 
production by producing “duplicate” documents reveals a misunderstanding of basic 
electronic discovery law and practices. Plaintiff utilized an electronic deduplication 
process prior to production. True duplicates were eliminated from the production. 
However, even documents that look alike contain different metadata. Any variance in 
metadata from document-to-document renders documents non-duplicative, even if they 
appear identical on their face. As courts in the Second Circuit has instructed, metadata is 
different for each document, but it may not show up when the documents are reduced to 
print. See In re Payment Card Interchange Fee & Merch. Disc., No. MD 05-1720(JG)(JO), 
2007 WL 121426, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 12, 2007) (“metadata (that is, data about data; in 
this context, information about an electronically stored document that may or not be visible 
if the document is reduced to printed form)”). Defendant served incredibly broad requests 
and is now complaining about the results they yielded. Defendant’s complaint about 
duplicates should be rejected because if a document is produced in a particular context, for 
example in a different litigation, and that was covered by a request, it was reproduced so 
that Defendant would have the exact information that satisfied her request. Moreover, 
there is no prejudice to Defendant in receiving a duplicate copy of a document. 
Defendant’s Position: Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to produce certain 
documents so she would be prejudiced by her deposition going forward on Friday, March 


25, 2016. 


Reality: There is no prejudice to Defendant because, on March 22, 2016, Ms. Giuffre 
produced and provided to Defendant a list of all the documents she may use at the 
deposition as well as all of those documents. 


o Defendant wrongfully states that Plaintiff has not produced travel records when she 
has indeed produced travel records. 


o Defendant wrongfully states that Plaintiff has not produced education records, 
when she has indeed produced everything she has relating to education. 


o Defendant wrongfully states that Plaintiff has not produced her communications 
with Epstein and Maxwell when she has indeed produced everything she has 
relating to those communications. 


o Defendant complains that Plaintiff has not produced “employment records for Mara 
Lago” but Plaintiffs search did not yield any responsive documents, and she stated 
that in her responses. 


o Defendant wrongfully states that Plaintiff will not produce a copy of her settlement 
agreement with Epstein when in fact, Plaintiff agreed to produce the settlement 
agreement upon receipt of the necessary waiver from Defendant and Epstein so she 
will not be in violation of its confidentiality provision. See McCawley Decl. at 
Exhibit 2, Supplemental Responses and Objections. 


o Defendant wrongfully states that Plaintiff has not produced a deposition transcript 
from the case of Edwards/Cassell v. Dershowitz, Case no. CACE 15-000072, when 
Defendant knows that Plaintiff is precluded from producing the transcript as it has 
been sealed by the Court in that matter, and Ms. Giuffre produced to Defendant a 
copy of the order sealing it. 


co Most importantly, none of these issues preclude the Defendant from being deposed 
in this case. 


Defendant’s Position: Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to make timely Rule 26 
disclosures. Defendant admits it is wasting the Court’s time by stating: “[w]hile these 
disclosures may not directly impact the subject matter of Defendant’s deposition, they 
demonstrate the bad-faith of Plaintiff fulfilling her discovery obligations, and also, 
ultimately may likely impact the discovery deadlines that have been set in this case.” 
(Def’s MPO at 14.) Defendant is throwing everything but the kitchen sink at the Court in 


the desperate attempt to avoid discovery by way of a deposition in this case. 


Reality: Plaintiff filed her initial Rule 26 disclosures on November 11, 2015 in accordance 
with the Rules. Defendant delayed four months until February 2016 before submitting her 
initial Rule 26 disclosures. Plaintiff supplemented her Rule 26 disclosures on March 11, 
2016 and added an addendum of information requested during the meet and confer on 
March 22, 2016. Ms. Giuffre has fully complied with her Rule 26 obligations, as fully 
briefed in her Response In Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff to 
Disclose Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1). See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, March 20, 
2016 Correspondence from Sigrid McCawley to Defendant’s counsel. 

Defendant’s Position: Defendant says Plaintiff has wrongfully objected to interrogatories. 
Reality: Local Rule 33.3 is clear that Defendant’s interrogatories are premature at this 
stage of the litigation and in violation of that Rule. Rule 33.3 provides: 


(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, at the commencement of discovery, 
interrogatories will be restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of 
information relevant to the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category 
of damage alleged, and the existence, custodian, location and general description of 
relevant documents, including pertinent insurance agreements, and other physical 
evidence, or information of a similar nature. 


(b) During discovery, interrogatories other than those seeking information described in 
paragraph (a) above may only be served (1) if they are a more practical method of 
obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition, or (2) if 
ordered by the Court. 


(c) At the conclusion of other discovery, and at least 30 days prior to the discovery cut-off 
date, interrogatories seeking the claims and contentions of the opposing party may be 
served unless the Court has ordered otherwise. 


S.D.N.Y. Civil R. 33.3. 


Defendant’s interrogatories seek information far beyond the scope of information specified 


in subparagraph (a) and Defendant has not demonstrated that these interrogatories are a more 
practical method of obtaining the requested information. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 7, 


Correspondence requesting Defendant’s counsel withdraw her premature Interrogatories. 


7 


Additionally, several of Defendant’s interrogatories are contention interrogatories, which 


subparagraph (c) makes clear are improper and premature at this early stage of discovery. 


A. Defendant’s interrogatories seek information beyond the scope permitted under 
Rule 33.3. 


Rule 33.3 limits interrogatories at the outset of discovery “to requests for witness names, 
computation of damages, and the location, custodian and general nature of pertinent documents.” 
Kunstler v. City of New York, No. 04CIV1145(RWS)(MHD), 2006 WL 2516625, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 29, 2006) aff'd, 242 F.R.D. 261 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (Sweet, J.) (citing S.D.N.Y. Civil R. 33.3(a) 
& (b)). These limits are to be enforced unless (1) interrogatories “are a more practical method of 
obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition, or (2) if ordered by 
the court.” Jd. 

Defendant’s Interrogatories seek information that does not fall into those exceptions. The 
requested information includes descriptions of medical treatment (Nos. 12-13) and employment 
records (No. 9); details and descriptions regarding income Ms. Giuffre has received over a period 
of 20 years (No. 10); information about Ms. Giuffre’s email and social media accounts (No. 2); 
descriptions of “the nature” of legal representation that Ms. Giuffre received (No. 3); details and 
descriptions concerning specific communications (Nos. 4-5), details about other incidents of 
defamation not at issue in this case (No. 7); and details concerning incidents of sexual assaults 
(No. 14). Defendant claims that “many of the interrogatories sought, consistent with Local Rule 
33.3(a), seek the names of witnesses and the custodians of records,” (Def’s MPO at FN 1). That 
does not excuse her violation of the rule since each interrogatory seeks far more than the 
identification of aname. J. Goldman & Co., L.P. v. Kowal, No. 96 CIV. 7868 DAB HBP, 1997 
WL 452332, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 1997) (“To the extent the interrogatories seek information 
beyond the identification of persons and transactions, depositions are more practical vehicles for 


obtaining the information.”). 


The information that Defendant’s interrogatories seek can be obtained more practically 
through other discovery methods. For instance, the information that Defendant seeks concerning 
Ms. Giuffre’s medical and employment histories and sources of income can be obtained more 
practically by deposing her and through issuing requests for production. See Kunstler, 2006 WL 
2516625, at *5 (denying defendants' request to compel response to interrogatory because 
“descriptions of the nature and extent of injuries, medical diagnoses, the course of treatment, and 
prescriptions are ordinarily more efficiently obtained through the production of pertinent medical 
records and through depositions” and thus exceed the scope of Local Civil Rule 33.3); Ferguson v. 
Ferrante, No. 13 CIV. 4468 VEC, 2014 WL 1327968, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2014) (finding that 
request for identifying information of certain bank accounts could be more efficiently obtained 
from plaintiff at a deposition rather than through interrogatories); Nunez v. City of New York, No. 
11 CIV. 5845 LTS JCF, 2013 WL 2149869, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2013) (denying motion to 
compel response to interrogatory seeking information about plaintiff's injuries and medical 
treatment because requests exceeded the scope of interrogatories permitted by Rule 33.3). As in 
the cases cited, the information that Defendant seeks regarding specific incidents and 
communications are more properly obtained through deposition testimony or document requests. 

In an attempt to justify her clear contravention of Rule 33.3, Defendant asserts that her 
interrogatories seek “the kind of minutiae that Plaintiff is unlikely to ‘recall’ at the time of her 
deposition.” (Def’s MPO at FN 1.) However, to date, Defendant has yet to take a single 
deposition in this case. Moreover, Defendant did not serve her first request for production until 
February 12, 2016, and the production in response to those requests is ongoing. Thus, her 
conclusory claim that “the remainder of interrogatories propounded” are “a more practical method 
of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or deposition,” id., is purely 


speculative and without any basis. For example, Ms. Giuffre has produced medical records, and 


will produce more, that will satisfy Interrogatory No. 9. At this early stage in discovery, 
Defendant has not and cannot justify interrogatories as a more practical way of obtaining the 


breadth of information requested in her interrogatories. 


B. Interrogatory Nos. 6, 8, And 11 Are Premature Contention Interrogatories. 


In addition to seeking information outside the scope permitted under Rule 33.3(a), 
Interrogatories Nos. 6, 8 and 11 are contention interrogatories, which seek identification of Ms. 
Giuffre’s claims and the facts underlying them. For instance, Interrogatory No. 6 directs Ms. 
Giuffre to “[i]dentify any ‘false statements’ attributed to Ghislaine Maxwell which were 
‘published globally’ ... as You contend in ... Your Complaint[.]” Interrogatory No. 8 directs Ms. 
Giuffre to identify, among other things, the dates, locations, and witnesses to Mr. Epstein’s sexual 
trafficking of Ms. Giuffre described in pleadings that Ms. Giuffre has filed in another action. 

Local Rule 33.3(c) clearly proscribes contention interrogatories such as these until “the 
conclusion of other discovery.” S.D.N.Y. Civil R. 33.3(c); see also Liveperson, Inc. v. 24/7 
Customer, Inc., No. 14 CIV. 1559 RWS, 2015 WL 4597546, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2015) 
(Sweet, J.) (noting that “contention interrogatories” are “available at the close rather than the 
beginning of discovery’). In applying this rule, this Court has found that contention 
interrogatories are improper when served early in discovery, before any depositions have been 
taken. Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., No 00 Civ. 5079, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3162, at 
*9-10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001) (Sweet, J.)(denying motion to compel responses to contention 
interrogatories where the only discovery that had occurred to date was document discovery and 
depositions had yet to be conducted); see also Regeneron Pharm., Inc. v. Merus B.V., No. 14 CIV. 
1650 KBF, 2014 WL 2447600, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 29, 2014) (denying party’s motion to compel 
responses to contention interrogatories at early stage in discovery); Trilegiant Corp. v. Sitel Corp., 


272 F.R.D. 360, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (same). 


10 


Defendant was not entitled to serve improper and premature interrogatories in clear 
violation of Local Rule 33.3, and Ms. Giuffre was under no obligation to respond. While 
Defendant has elected to ignore the limitations in Rule 33.3, Ms. Giuffre has complied with the 
terms of the rule and, to date, has not served any interrogatories whatsoever. Moreover, Ms. 
Giuffre provided responses to some of Defendant’s interrogatories, subject to objections, and 
despite the fact that she was not required to do so. Defendant’s attempt to base her Motion for a 
Protective Order on interrogatory responses is in direct violation of Local Rule 33.3 and should be 
denied. 

CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above, Ms. Giuffre respectfully requests that the Court deny 


Defendant’s Motion for Protective Order and direct Defendant to sit for her deposition scheduled 


for March 25, 2016.

EXHIBIT 2 








Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-2 Filed 03/23/16 Page 2 of 45 


United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
Virginia L. Giuffre, 
Plaintiff, Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS 
V. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 


Defendant. 





PLAINTIFF’S AMENDED SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE AND OBJECTIONS 
TO DEFENDANT’S FIRST SET OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO PLAINTIFF 


Plaintiff hereby serves her amended supplemental responses and objections to 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests. 


GENERAL OBJECTIONS 


Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests violates Local Civil Rule 33.3. Defendant 
has served interrogatories that are in direct violation of that Rule because the interrogatories are 
not “restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information relevant to 
the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and the 
existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent 
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.” Local 
Civil Rule 33.3(a). Instead, they seek information under subsections (b) and (c) of Local Civil 
Rule 33.3, and therefore, they should not be served because they are not “a more practical 
method of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition,” and 
because they were served in advance of the period “30 days prior to the discovery cut-off date.” 


Local Civil Rule 33.3(b), (c). The interrogatories you served violate Local Rule 33.3 and we ask 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-2 Filed 03/23/16 Page 3 of 45 


that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories. See Rule 33.3, Local Rules for the 
Southern District of New York; see also Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., No. 00 CIV. 
5079 (Sweet, J.), 2001 WL 286727, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001); accord Gary Friedrich 
Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Enterprises, Inc., No. 08 CIV. 1533 BSJ JCF, 2011 WL 1642381, at 
*4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2011). Specifically, Rule 33.3 provides: 

(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, at the commencement of discovery, 
interrogatories will be restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with 
knowledge of information relevant to the subject matter of the action, the 
computation of each category of damage alleged, and the existence, custodian, 
location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent 
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar 
nature. 

(b) During discovery, interrogatories other than those seeking information described 
in paragraph (a) above may only be served (1) if they are a more practical method 
of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition, 
or (2) if ordered by the Court. 

(c) At the conclusion of other discovery, and at least 30 days prior to the discovery 
cut-off date, interrogatories seeking the claims and contentions of the opposing 
party may be served unless the Court has ordered otherwise. 

Similarly, Requests for Production numbers 1, 2, 4, 6(i), 9, 12, 30, 35 and 37 also violate 

Local Rule 33.3 in that they rely on the offending interrogatory requests. The Rule provides that 
a party must first try to obtain discovery through document production and testimony. Discovery 
does not close in this case until July 1, 2016, and Defendant has not yet noticed a deposition. As 
such, these interrogatories violate Local Rule 33.3 and are premature. 

Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests also violates Rule 33, Fed. R. Civ. P., which 

provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all 
discrete subparts” — in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories, including subparts, 


in violation of Rule 33. We ask that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories that exceed 


the 25 interrogatory limit set by Rule 33. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-2 Filed 03/23/16 Page 4 of 45 


Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they 
seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to, 
attorney client privilege, work product privilege, joint defense/common interest privilege, public 
interest privilege, and any other applicable privilege. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent Defendant’s First Set of Discovery 
Requests call for the production of documents or information that is already in the possession, 
custody, or control of the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre further objects to the requests to the extent that 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests is duplicative of documents and information that 
can equally or more readily be obtained by the Defendant. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they seek documents that are not 
relevant, material, or necessary to this action and, thus, are not reasonably calculated to lead to 
the discovery of admissible evidence. Many of the requests in the Defendant’s First Set of 
Discovery seek documents that are in no way limited to their relation to this case. Indeed, they 
seek documents that are not important to resolving the issues; documents that are not relevant to 
any party’s claim or defense; and documents that are not proportional to the needs of the case. 
Such requests create a heavy burden on Ms. Giuffre that outweighs any benefit. Such discovery 
is prohibited by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly under the 2015 amendments to 
Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., and is wholly inappropriate. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they are overly broad and unduly 
burdensome, as individually logging all privileged responsive documents would be overly 
burdensome. Plaintiff contends that requests targeting such privileged information are overly 
broad under Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as 


overly burdensome to the extent that they would require logging voluminous and ever-increasing 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-2 Filed 03/23/16 Page 5 of 45 


privileged communications between Ms. Giuffre and her counsel after the date litigation 
commenced on September 21, 2015. Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as overly burdensome to 
the extent that they would require logging voluminous privileged documents between Ms. 
Giuffre and her counsel related to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, Case no. 08- 
80736-CIV-Marra, pending in the Southern District of Florida; Bradley Edwards and Paul 
Cassell v. Alan Dershowitz, Case no. CACE 15-000072, pending in the Seventeenth Judicial 
Circuit, Broward County, Florida; and Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656- 
CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of Florida). Accordingly, due the undue burden of 
individually logging responsive privileged documents related to Defendant’s overly broad 
requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging of such privileged responsive documents 
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c). 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole 
purpose of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a victim of sexual trafficking. Ms. 
Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent they are overly broad and unduly burdensome. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s definition of “your attorneys” because it includes 
names of attorneys that do not represent her, including Spencer Kuvin and Jack Scarola. 

Ms. Giuffre’s responses to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests are being made 
after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information and 
documentation that is presently known to her. Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or 
supplement her responses. Ms. Giuffre is producing documents and information herewith, and 
she will continue to review and produce relevant documents until completion. 


Ms. Giuffre incorporates her above-listed general objections in the responses herein.

Giuffre objects to this request in that it is not limited in date range in any way; therefore if 
she was on a prescription drug when she was 2 years old, she would have to produce that 
document. Ms. Giuffre also objects to this request in that it is not limited to prescription 
drugs she has taken as a result of the abuse she endured. Ms. Giuffre objects to this request

United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
Virginia L. Giuffre, 
Plaintiff, Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS 
V. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 


Defendant. 





PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE AND OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT’S 
FIRST SET OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO PLAINTIFF 


Plaintiff hereby serves her responses and objections to Defendant’s First Set of 
Discovery Requests. 


GENERAL OBJECTIONS 


Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests violates Local Civil Rule 33.3. Defendant 
has served interrogatories that are in direct violation of that Rule because the interrogatories are 
not “restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information relevant to 
the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and the 
existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent 
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.” Local 
Civil Rule 33.3(a). Instead, they seek information under subsections (b) and (c) of Local Civil 
Rule 33.3, and therefore, they should not be served because they are not “a more practical 
method of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition,” and 
because they were served in advance of the period “30 days prior to the discovery cut-off date.” 


Local Civil Rule 33.3(b), (c). The interrogatories you served violate Local Rule 33.3 and we ask 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-3 Filed 03/23/16 Page 3 of 40 


that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories. See Rule 33.3, Local Rules for the 
Southern District of New York; see also Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., No. 00 CIV. 
5079 (Sweet, J.), 2001 WL 286727, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001); accord Gary Friedrich 
Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Enterprises, Inc., No. 08 CIV. 1533 BSJ JCF, 2011 WL 1642381, at 
*4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2011). Specifically, Rule 33.3 provides: 

(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, at the commencement of discovery, 
interrogatories will be restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with 
knowledge of information relevant to the subject matter of the action, the 
computation of each category of damage alleged, and the existence, custodian, 
location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent 
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar 
nature. 

(b) During discovery, interrogatories other than those seeking information described 
in paragraph (a) above may only be served (1) if they are a more practical method 
of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition, 
or (2) if ordered by the Court. 

(c) At the conclusion of other discovery, and at least 30 days prior to the discovery 
cut-off date, interrogatories seeking the claims and contentions of the opposing 
party may be served unless the Court has ordered otherwise. 

Similarly, Requests for Production numbers 1, 2, 4, 6(i), 9, 12, 30, 35 and 37 also violate 

Local Rule 33.3 in that they rely on the offending interrogatory requests. The Rule provides that 
a party must first try to obtain discovery through document production and testimony. Discovery 
does not close in this case until July 1, 2016, and Defendant has not yet noticed a deposition. As 
such, these interrogatories violate Local Rule 33.3 and are premature. 

Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests also violates Rule 33, Fed. R. Civ. P., which 

provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all 
discrete subparts” — in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories, including subparts, 


in violation of Rule 33. We ask that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories that exceed 


the 25 interrogatory limit set by Rule 33. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-3 Filed 03/23/16 Page 4 of 40 


Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they 
seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to, 
attorney client privilege, work product privilege, joint defense/common interest privilege, agency 
privilege, investigative privilege, spousal privilege, doctor/patient privilege, accountant/client 
privilege, and any other applicable privilege. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent Defendant’s First Set of Discovery 
Requests call for the production of documents or information that is already in the possession, 
custody, or control of the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre further objects to the requests to the extent that 
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests is duplicative of documents and information that 
can equally or more readily be obtained by the Defendant. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they seek documents that are not 
relevant, material, or necessary to this action and, thus, are not reasonably calculated to lead to 
the discovery of admissible evidence. Many of the requests in the Defendant’s First Set of 
Discovery seek documents that are in no way limited to their relation to this case. Indeed, they 
seek documents that are not important to resolving the issues; documents that are not relevant to 
any party’s claim or defense; and documents that are not proportional to the needs of the case. 
Such requests create a heavy burden on Ms. Giuffre that outweighs any benefit. Such discovery 
is prohibited by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly under the 2015 amendments to 
Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., and is wholly inappropriate. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they are overly broad and unduly 
burdensome, as individually logging all privileged responsive documents would be overly 
burdensome. Plaintiff contends that requests targeting such privileged information are overly 


broad under Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-3 Filed 03/23/16 Page 5 of 40 


overly burdensome to the extent that they would require logging voluminous and ever-increasing 
privileged communications between Ms. Giuffre and her counsel after the date litigation 
commenced on September 21, 2015. Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as overly burdensome to 
the extent that they would require logging voluminous privileged documents between Ms. 
Giuffre and her counsel related to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, Case no. 08- 
80736-CIV-Marra, pending in the Southern District of Florida; Bradley Edwards and Paul 
Cassell v. Alan Dershowitz, Case no. CACE 15-000072, pending in the Seventeenth Judicial 
Circuit, Broward County, Florida; and Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656- 
CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of Florida). Accordingly, due the undue burden of 
individually logging responsive privileged documents related to Defendant’s overly broad 
requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging of such privileged responsive documents 
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c). 

Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole 
purpose of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a victim of sexual trafficking. Ms. 
Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent they are overly broad and unduly burdensome. 

Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s definition of “your attorneys” because it includes 
names of attorneys that do not represent her, including Spencer Kuvin and Jack Scarola. 

Ms. Giuffre’s responses to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests are being made 
after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information and 
documentation that is presently known to her. Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or 
supplement her responses. Ms. Giuffre is producing documents and information herewith, and 
she will continue to review and produce relevant documents until completion. 


Ms. Giuffre incorporates her above-listed general objections in the responses herein.

Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in that it seeks information that is sought by Defendant only

a. 


Due to safety concerns with respect to Ms. Giuffre and her minor children, 
she is not at liberty to reveal her present residential location. To ensure that

Jeffrey S. Pagliuca, Esq. 

HADDON, MORGAN & FOREMAN, P.C. 
150 East 10"" Avenue 

Denver, Colorado 80203 


Re:  Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
Case no. 15-cv-07433-RWS 


Dear Mr. Pagliuca: 


I write today in response to your letter sent on Friday, March 18, 2016, requesting a meet 
and confer conference. I was disappointed that even after Judge Sweet’s comments at the 
hearing on Thursday; you would disregard his sentiments and write a baseless letter threatening 
sanctions. Your words are defeated by the actions in this case which establish two things: 


(1) The plaintiff has timely and properly engaged in discovery; and 


(2) The defendant has created numerous intentional delays and has engaged in bad faith 
discovery by, for example, only producing two e-mails in response to 39 Requests for Production 
and by delaying for four months before serving Defendant’s Rule 26 disclosures. 


The false accusations in your “meet and confer” letter are unproductive and do not serve 
to advance any meaningful discussion on the issues that you raise. Moreover, your accusations 
and threats of sanctions are ironic given your persistent refusal to abide by basic discovery 
obligations and the provisions of the governing Local Rules. While we respond below to each of 
the specific points that you raise, the obvious purpose of your letter is an attempt to manufacture 
bases for use in your client’s ongoing effort to avoid being deposed in this case. 


Turning to the specific issues your raise, I shall address them in turn. 


First, you accuse us of bad faith with regard to our client’s Rule 26 disclosures. As you 
are no doubt aware, Defendant delayed for four months before producing her Rule 26 
disclosures. Ms. Giuffre, on the other hand, has undertaken to provide comprehensive 
disclosures. It appears you attempt to take issue with the fact that Ms. Giuffre does not have 
contact information for some of the individuals listed on the Rule 26 disclosures. Ms. Giuffre 
listed contact information for anyone for whom she was able to confirm the information and that 
is her obligation under the Rule 26 standards. Notably Defendant’s Rule 26 disclosure also fails 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-5 Filed 03/23/16 Page 3 of 4 


BOLTES; SGHELLER &© FLEXNER ELP 


to list contact information for many of the individuals despite the fact that your client has 
admitted she has a joint defense relationship with her co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein who clearly 
has all the contact information for the individuals listed. 


We have provided proper damage disclosures including damage calculations. We intend 
to retain expert witnesses relating to damages issues in this case as provided for in the Court’s 
scheduling order. I will not address your false characterization of the damage calculations. Ms. 
Giuffre’s damage disclosures are proper under Rule 26. See Naylor v. Rotech Healthcare, Inc., 
679 F. Supp. 2d 505, 510 (D. Vt. 2009). 


Second, your allegations regarding Plaintiff's interrogatory responses reveal that you 
have not taken the time to read the provisions of Local Rule 33.3. Had you read this rule, you 
would be aware that Defendant’s interrogatories are premature and improper. I direct you to 
Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., No. 00 CIV. 5079 (Sweet, J.), 2001 WL 286727, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001); accord Gary Friedrich Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Enterprises, Inc., 
No. 08 CIV. 1533 BSJ JCF, 2011 WL 1642381, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2011). 


Third, you lodge a hallow attack on Ms. Giuffre’s document production with the 
transparent agenda of trying to use your false claims to again delay the deposition of the 
Defendant. Ms. Giuffre has properly and timely engaged in discovery in this matter and unlike 
the Defendant who has only produced two documents in response to 39 requests for production 
of documents — if anyone is engaging in bad faith discovery conduct it is plainly the Defendant. 
Ms. Giuffre produced documents within the time frame allowed by the rules and is continuing to 
supplement her production as required. Ms. Giuffre is in the process of making a full and 
complete document production, consisting of thousands of pages, and any issues you have with 
the volume of this production are the sole result of Defendant’s expansive and overly broad 


requests. 


You also make a vague, and non-specific claim with regard to plaintiff's privilege log 
which does not provide adequate context for us to assess the issues you are attempting to raise 
for purposes of a meet and confer. As the Court stated on Thursday, you must provide us specific 
written notice of the issue you are raising prior to the meet and confer call on this issue. 


Fourth, you wrongfully accuse me of violating the rules of professional conduct with 
regard to statements made about Ms. Giuffre’s document production. Like the overall tone of 
your letter, this accusation is unprofessional and unbecoming. In response to Defendant’s overly 
broad discovery requests, Ms. Giuffre is in the process of completing the production of the 
responsive documents in her possession. As is Ms. Giuffre’s obligation under the discovery 
rules, she is producing the documents that are responsive to your very broad requests. For 
example, Defendant’s Request 27 seeks: 


“All documents, written or recorded, which reference by name or other description 
Ghislaine Maxwell.” 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 71-5 Filed 03/23/16 Page 4 of 4 


BOIES, SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP 


Defendant cannot be heard to complain when your requests cover those documents. We ran a 
multitude of search terms to cover Defendant’s broad production requests and produced those 
documents from Ms. Giuffre’s electronically stored information. If pleadings contained 
responsive information, and they were stored in Ms. Giuffre’s electronic files, then we produced 
them as is our obligation. Unlike the Defendant who delayed discovery production for four 
months and then failed to produce anything except two e-mails, we have complied with the 
production rules. In closing, the intention behind your letter, and the allegations raised therein, 
are self-serving attempts to further delay the Defendant’s deposition. 


Per your request, we are available to meet and confer on Monday, March 21, 2016 
anytime between 2:00 EST and 5:00 EST. Please let me know what time works best for you and 
we will reserve that time. 


Sincerely, 


Sigrid S. McCawley

Re: Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
Case no. 15-cv-07433-RWS 


Dear Ms. Menninger: 


We are in receipt of your discovery requests sent via electronic mail on Friday, February 
12, 2016 that are attached hereto as exhibit A. The interrogatories you served violate Local Rule 
33.3 and we ask that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories. See Rule 33.3, Local 
Rules for the Southern District of New York; see also Shannon v. New York City Transit Auth., 
No. 00 CIV. 5079 (Sweet, J.), 2001 WL 286727, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001); accord Gary 
Friedrich Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Enterprises, Inc., No. 08 CIV. 1533 BSJ JCF, 2011 WL 
1642381, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2011). 


Similarly, Requests for Production numbers 1, 2, 4, 6(i), 9, 12, 30, 35 and 37 also violate 
Local Rule 33.3 in that they rely on the offending interrogatory requests. We ask that you 
reissue your Request for Production such that they comply with the Local Rule. 


Finally, the interrogatories you served also violate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33 in 
that they contain in total fifty nine (59) requests including subparts. Kindly confirm you will be 
withdrawing the interrogatories and reissuing interrogatories that comply with Local Rule 33.3 
so that we do not have to incur the expense of filing a motion with the Court.

Dear Judge Sweet: 


Counsel for Ms. Giuffre inadvertently filed a confidential document as Exhibit 4 to Docket 
Entry 79. In order to rectify the error, counsel for Ms. Giuffre spoke with an employee with the 
ECF help desk who instructed us to inform the Court via letter that he placed a temporary seal on 
Exhibit 4 to Docket Entry 79, Declaration of Sigrid S. McCawley, pursuant to this Court’s 
Protective Order (Docket Entry 62). Thank you for your consideration and my apologies for the 


error.

Dear Judge Sweet: 





Plaintiff's counsel contends that Defendant’s Reply in Support of Motion to 
Compel Responses to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests (Doc. #92) 
contains at page 9 information designated “Confidential” pursuant to this Court’s 
Protective Order (Doc. #62). 


While we disagree, and contend that Plaintiff has waived any Confidentiality 
by making representations to the Court in her publicly filed Response regarding her 
medical records and the contents thereof, we nevertheless are requesting that the 
Reply be placed under seal and that we substitute for public filmg a Reply which 
omits words from page 9 about which Plaintiff complains. 


Thank you for your consideration and we apologize to the Court for the 
inconvenience this disagreement has caused.

Re: Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
Case no. 15-cv-07433-RWS — Regarding Protective Order 


Dear Judge Sweet: 


This is a letter motion to file Ms. Giuffre’s Non-Redacted Reply in Support of Motion for 
Forensic Examination (“Reply Brief”) and certain accompanying exhibits under seal pursuant to 
this Court’s March 18, 2016, Protective Order and the Southern District of New York Electronic 
Case Filing Rules & Instructions 6.2. 


The Protective Order states: 


Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be accompanied by a Motion to 
Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the 

Southern District of New York. 


See Protective Order [DE 62] signed on March 17, 2016, at p. 4. Defendants have designated 
certain documents as Confidential Information and have designated Defendant’s entire 
deposition testimony as confidential. Ms. Giuffre takes no position at this time on whether 
Detfendant’s designations are proper. Because of the Protective Order, however, Ms. Giuffre 
believes that she cannot presently produce or reference such documents in public court filings. 
Accordingly, as Ms. Giuffre’s Reply Brief contains material that Defendant has designated as 
confidential, she seeks leave to file the Non-Redacted Reply Brief and certain related exhibits 
under seal. 


Respectfully submitted,

DEFENDANT GHISLAINE MAXWELL’S RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS TO 
PLAINTIFE’S FIRST REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 


Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby responds 
to Plaintiff's First Request for Production of Documents (the “Requests”’). 


PRELIMINARY STATEMENT AND GENERAL OBJECTIONS 


I, This response is made to the best of Ms. Maxwell’s present knowledge, 
information and belief. Ms. Maxwell, through her attorneys of record, have not completed the 
investigation of the facts relating to this case, have not completed discovery in this action, and 
have not completed preparation for trial. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to Plaintiff’s requests are 
based on information currently known to her and are given without waiving Ms. Maxwell’s right 
to use evidence of any subsequently discovered or identified facts, documents or 
communications. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to supplement this Response in accordance 
with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e). 


2; Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they attempt to impose any 
requirement or discovery obligation greater than or different from those under the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the local rules of this Court or any Orders of the Court. 


2 Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek documents or 
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, Rule 408 of the 
Federal Rules of Evidence, any common interest privilege, joint defense agreement or any other 
applicable privilege. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 122-3 Filed 04/25/16 Page 3 of 18 


4, Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek documents or 
information outside of Ms. Maxwell’s possession, custody or control. 


a. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information which is 
not relevant to the subject matter of the litigation and/or is not reasonably calculated to lead to 
the discovery of admissible evidence. 


6. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are overly broad, unduly 
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying, embarrassing, or 
harassing Ms. Maxwell. 


a Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are vague and ambiguous, 
or imprecise. 


8. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information that is 
confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interests. 


a, Ms. Maxwell incorporates by reference every general objection set forth above 
into each specific response set forth below. A specific response may repeat a general objection 
for emphasis or for some other reason. The failure to include any general objection in any 
specific response does not waive any general objection to that request. 


10. The Requests seek information that is confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s 
privacy interests. To the extent such information is relevant and discoverable in this action, Ms. 
Maxwell will produce such materials subject to an appropriate protective order pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 26(c) limiting their dissemination to the attorneys and their employees. 


OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS 


ll. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 1 regarding “Agent” to the extent that it 
purports to extend the meaning beyond those permissible by law. 


12. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 3 regarding “Detendant.” The Definition 
is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of the 
Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms. 
Maxwell or her counsel. 


13. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 5 regarding “Employee.” Ms. Maxwell is 
an individual, sued in an individual capacity, and therefore there is no “past or present officer, 
director, agent or servant” of hers. Additionally, “attorneys” and “paralegals” are not 
“employees” of Ms. Maxwell given that she herself is not an attorney and therefore cannot 
“employ” attorneys. 


14. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 9 regarding “You” or “Your.” The 
Definition is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 122-3 Filed 04/25/16 Page 4 of 18 


the Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms. 
Maxwell or her counsel. 


OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS 


15. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 1, in particular the definition of the 
“Relevant Period” to include July 1999 to the present, on the grounds that it is overly broad and 
unduly burdensome and calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action 
and not reasonably caiculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Complaint at 
paragraph 9 purports to describe events pertaining to Plaintiff and Defendant occurring in the 
years 1999 —2002, The Complaint also references staternents attributed to Ms. Maxwell 
occurring in January 2015. Defining the “Relevant Period” as “July 1999 to the present” is 
vastly overbroad, irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible 
evidence, and as to certain of the Requests, is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or 
harassing Ms. Maxwell and it implicates her privacy rights. Thus, Ms. Maxwell interprets the 
Relevant Period to be limited to 1999-2002 and December 30, 2014 - January 31, 2015 and 
objects to production of any documents outside that period, except as specifically noted. 


16. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 3 on the grounds that it is unduly 
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell. 
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific disposition of documents, particularly electronic 
documents, dating back over 16 years. However, Ms. Maxwell, prior to this litigation has long 
had a practice of deleting emails after they have been read. 


17, Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction Nos. 5, 8, 9, 12, 17 to the extent they seek to 
impose obligations to supply explanations for the presence or absence of such documents, to 
specifically identify persons or documents, to provide information concerning who prepared 
documents, the location of any copies of such documents, the identities and contact information 
for persons who have custody or control of such documents, the reasons for inability to produce 
portions of documents, and the “natural person in whose possession they were found,” beyond 
the requirements of Rule 34. These Instructions improperly seek to propound Interrogatories 
pursuant to Rule 33, 


18. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 13 on the grounds that it is unduly 
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell. 
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific circumstances upon which a document dating 
back 16 years has ceased to exist. 


19. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 15 to the extent that it calls for documents 
or information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or any other 
applicable privilege. 


20. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instructions Nos. 18 & 19 to the extent they require 
information on any privilege log above and beyond the requirements of Local Civil Rule 26.2.

Re: Giufffre v. Maxwell 
Case No. 15-ev-07433-RWS 





Dear Ms. Menninger and Mr. Pagliuca, 


We would like to schedule a meet and confer call regarding the following topics. I 
estimate that the meet and confer will take 45 minutes. I am available today at 1:30 pm — 3:00 
pm (EST) or 3:30 pm — 5:30 pm (EST) and tomorrow from 10:00 am — 4:00 pm (EST). The 
following are the topics I would like to discuss. 


1. The Court, at the hearing on March 17, 2016, granted Ms. Giuttre’s Motion to Compel 
the production of documents from Defendant. To date, we have not received any 
additional document production from Defendant. As you are aware, Ms. Giuffre first 
served her Requests for Production on October 27, 2015. We wrote to you on March 28, 
2016 requesting that you produce documents in accordance with the Court’s Order by 
April 6, 2016 which gave you twenty (20) days from the date of the Court’s ruling at the 
hearing to produce documents. We would like to have a call today or tomorrow to meet 
and confer on Defendant’s document production. 


2, You have noticed Ms. Giuffre for deposition on May 3, 2016. We would also like to 
discuss Defendant’s identification and production of all documents to be used in Ms. 
Giuffre’s deposition. As you are aware, Ms. Giuffre provided such materials in advance 


of Defendant’s deposition. 


3. Finally, we would like to discuss Defendant’s discovery collection procedures, including, 
electronically stored information collection procedures and search terms that Defendant is 


using to collect production documents.

Virginia L. Giuffre, 


Plaintiff, Case No.: ]5-cv-07433-RWS 


Ghislaine Maxwell, 


Defendant. 


STIPULATED DISCOVERY PLAN 
FOR ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION 


Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 29. this Stipulated Discovery Plan for 
Electronically Stored Information (the “Stipulation”) is entered into by and among the named 
parties in the above-captioned action, through their respective counsel of record. 

L Definitions: For purposes of this Stipulation: 

(a) The term “Plaintiff” refers to Virginia Giulfre 

(b) The term “Defendant” reters to Ghislaine Maxwell. 

(c) Che term “parties” refers collectively to Plaintiffand Defendant. 

(d} The term “party” refers individually to Plaintiff or Defendant. 

2. Electronic Discovery - The Collection and Culling of ESI: In a joint effort to 
balance the volume, relevance, and costs of the production and review process, the parties 
stipulate to the following involving the handling and production of electronically stored 
information (“FSI”). 

(a) Counsel for Defendant and Plaintiff will correspond regarding custodians and 


sources of documents from which they are collecting ESI for production in the above- 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 122-6 Filed 04/25/16 Page 4 of 12 


captioned action. The parties will work in good faith to identify. discuss, agree upon, and 
revise, if necessary, the custodians and sources of documents from which ESI is collected and 
reviewed for possible production in the matter to avoid an unduly burdensome production or 
retrieving a large quantity of non-responsive ESI. The parties agree that search terms and other 
techniques to identuly potentially responsive ESI for review and possible production may be 
useful to allow document production to complete in a reasonable amount of time. To the 
extent that a party plans to use search terms to identify potentially responsive ESI, the parties 
agree to work in good faith to agree upon acceptable search terms that will assist in identifying 
potentially responsive ESI. 

To the extent practicable, the parties shall use informal procedures, agreed upon 
through a meet-and-confer process, for the production of electronically stored information. 
The parties have proposed this detailed Stipulation in satisfaction of their obligations under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f)(3)(C) and to provide rules governing production of 
electronically stored information in the event that the parties are unable to agree to informal 
procedures that are satisfactory to all parties. 

(b) In the event of a dispute or disagreement. the parties will meet and confer ina 
good faith effort to resolve such dispute or disagreement which includes the production and 
review of a limited sampling of the information sought. Further, insofar as this Stipulation 
relates to the general protocol of identifying and producing ESI, any party may bring a motion 
to modily or clarif¥ the application of this Supulation to particular LSI or otherwise. 

This Stipulation is designed, and shall be interpreted, to ensure a balance of the necds 
of the party requesting electronic discovery to obtain all responsive documents and

responding to a request for production or other production requirement. Nothing in this 
Stipulation is intended to be an exhaustive list of discovery obligations of a producing party or 
tights of the requesting party. To the extent additional obligations or rights not addressed in 
this Stipulation arise under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or applicable State or Federal 
statutes. they shall be controlling. All parties reserve their rights under the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure for matters relating to the production of information that are not specifically 
addressed in this Stipulation. 

(o) Each party shall make a reasonable and diligent effort to search for and collect 
reasonably accessible and responsive ESI from the following sources for each of its designated 
custodian’s: active e-mail accounts utilized during the relevant time period, ESI stored on each 
such custodian’s computer hard-drive. and other locations (to the extent agreed upon by the 
parties) used by each such custodian to sture potentially responsive USI. The parties will filter 
the ESI they collect using search terms ayrecd upon by the parties. Ifa party identifies ES] 
that is not reasonably accessible but is likely to contain responsive non-duplicative 
information, it will provide to the other party a description of the source of the ESI that it 
claims is not reasonably accessible and the basis of the claim that the source is not reasonably 
accessible. — (d) In addition, the parties shall collect reasonably accessible and 
responsive ESI from their computers (including laptop and notebook computers), tablets, 
mobile phones, electronic document repositories, or any other electronic file storage media, a 
party identifies following a reasonable and diligent investigation, as hkely to contain 
responsive ESI. The search terms will be run against the KSI collected from the locations and 


devices listed above.

conduct a reasonable search for and collect reasonably accessible, non-duplicative responsive 
hard-copy data in the possession of agreed-upon custodians. ‘The parties agree 10 produce such 
hard copy documents in single-page TIFF tormat along with document level OCR text files 
and the following fields in a Concordance load file as described in Section 5 below: 

(i) Custodian (Name of Custodian from which the file is being produced); 

(il) BegBates (Beginning Production Number): 

(ii)  EndBates (Ending Production Number);

Each partv shall bear the cost of converting the hard-copy paper documents it produces to 
TIFF format and for providing the load file. 

4, ESI - Processing and Production: The partics supulate to the following regarding 
the processing and production of documents that were originally maintained as ESE: 

(a) EXCLUSIONS FROM PROCESSING: The parties may exclude from collection, 
review, and production ESI or data with file extensions that typically contain no meaningful 
user-created data and/or cannot be reviewed in any meaningful format. Specifically, the parties 
agree that hey may exclude (i) files with the following extensions (provided that the file 
signature matches the extension): .COM, EXE, .BAT, .DLL, SYS, VAD, .BIN, ASH, ASM. 
.B, BAS, BCP, .C, .CPP, .H, Ci, .CPL, FRM, .MOD, .RH, .VB,.VBX, XLV, .RG-and (it) 
those file types contained on the list established by the National Institute of Standards in 
Technology (“NIST”) (collectively, the “Permitted Excluded Files’). To the extent that the 


either party wishes to exclude file types not included within the Permitted Excluded Files from 


processing, the parties will meet and confer to regarding any such request.

‘To the extent responsive, audio, video, photo, and other media files such as stand-alone 
audio, video, or graphic shall be produced in their native format. ‘fo the extent it would be 
impractical to produce responsive ESI as it is kept in the normal course of business the parties 
will meet and confer concerning the collection and production of those reports. 

(b) DE-DUPLICATION, In order to reduce the volume of documents reviewed and 
produced, each party shall de-duplicate EST using the SHA1 or MDS5 hash value. Such de- 
duplication will be done across the universe of all ESI produced and will be performed at the 
family level. De-duplicated originals and metadata shall be securely retained. 

{cj NON-E-MAIL ESI: The native format of all non-e-mail ESI will be maintained 
by each party, Non-c-mail EST will be produced in single-page TP format (except for non-

Electronic mail shall be produced along with attachments in sequential order as part of a 
family, maintaining the parent-child relationship, to the extent the message or any attachment is 
responsive. If any message or attachment is responsive but is withheld based on privilege, the 
entire family may be withheld (to the extent necessary to protect privilege} provided, however, 
that if an email or attachment withheld pursuant to this sentence is not subject to an independent 
claim of privilege, the party withholding such email or attachment will ensure that it is otherwise 
included in its production. 

(e) REDACTED ESI: Production of redacted ESI shall be subject to the general 
production requirements set forth herein, however the following metadata need not be provided 
for documents that are redacted: Doc Title, Doe Subject, Filename, Email Subject. Further, for 
each document that is redacted, the field “Redacted” shall be populated with the value “Yes” and 
OCR text files of the redacted document shall be provided. 

(f) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS AND OTHER DATA THAT DOES NOT EASILY 
LEND ITSELF TO TIFFING: All Excel spreadsheets and other data that does not easily lend 
itself to TIFFing, including but not limited to, CSV files, audio files, and video files, shall be 
produced in native format with a TIFF placeholder, except if an Excel spreadsheet must be 
redacted in which case it shall be produced in TIFF format (provided, however, that if the party 
receiving a redacted Excel spreadsheet in TIFF format determines that a native version is 
necessary, the party producing the Excel spreadsheet shall make available a native version of the 
Excel spreadsheet with any redactions necessary to protect privilege (1.e. not the original native 
file)). This paragraph shall apply to all such ESI irrespective of whether it takes the form of 


standalone files or attachments to e-mails or other files. To the extent that any Excel spreadsheet 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 122-6 Filed 04/25/16 Page 10 of 12 


requires a confidentiality legend, the TIFF placeholder shall contain such confidentiality legend, 
and the filename of the Excel spreadsheet shall also include such confidentiality legend. 

(gz) ZJP FILES: All compressed or zipped ESI shall be unzipped or decompressed 
before production. To the extent a responsive, non-privileged electronic file contains embedded 
files, or links to other files, such embedded files or links to other files do not need to be produced 
initially, but to the extent the receiving party determines they are necessary, the parties will meet 
and confer regarding production of the native files. The parties agree that they need not produce 
all files in a zip folder in the event any individual file in the zip folder is responsive. To the 
extent that there are multiple files within a zip folder, each shall be considered a single document 
with respect to determining responsiveness (unless attached to an email, in which case the 
protocol in subsection (d) hereof shall apply). 

(h) The parties agree to meet and confer in good faith if there are any other file types 
that encounter difficulties in the production preparation process and will discuss native 
production of such files if necessary. 

5. Production of ESI & Hard Copy Documents: The parties agree to the following 
regarding production of all documents: 

(a) The production of all documents shall be in Concordance-ready format and the 
following load files will be produced: 

(1) Opticon load file compliant with Concordance to load the images; 

(it) Document level extracted text or OCR (for documents that have been 
redacted or documents without extractable text); 

(iit) DAT file containing the fields specified herein, with the field names as 


otherwise provided herein, in the first row. The .DAT file shall be 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 122-6 Filed 04/25/16 Page 11 of 12 


provided with the following hierarchy of delimiters: field - (ASCII 20), 
quote - (ASCTE 254), return value in data - (ASCIL 174) 

(b) Each page of a produced document shall have a legible, unique page identifier 
(“Bates Number”) electronically “burned” onto the image. Additionally, any applicable 
confidentiality legend shall be “burned” into the document image. No other legend or stamp will 
be placed on the document image other than a confidentiality legend or redactions (where 
necessary to protect the attorney-client communication privilege, work product doctrine, or other 
protection). If the page identifier or legend inadvertently obliterates, conceals, or interferes with 
any information from the source document, the receiving party shall request and the producing 
party shall produce a legible copy. 

(c) Each page image file shall be named with the unique Bates Number of the page of 
the document in the case of single-page TIFFs, followed by the extension “TIF.” 

(d) The parties shall honor reasonable and specific written requests for the production 
of native versions of files and volor images to the extent such requests are not unduly 
burdensome, subject to any necessary redactions to protect the attorney-client or other privileges. 

(e) The parties shall honor reasonable and specific written requests to make originals 
of any produced document available for inspection and copying, subject to any necessary 
redactions to protect the attorney-client or other privileges. 

) The parties reserve the right to seck and to object to the costs arising from any 
discovery or from any improper conduct or bad faith of the litigants. 

6. Clawback Provision: The parties agree that clawbacks of any inadvertently 


produced privileged material shall be made upon notice to the other party

Re: Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
Case no. 15-cv-07433-RWS — Regarding Protective Order 





Dear Judge Sweet: 


This is a letter motion to file Ms. Giuffre’s Non-Redacted Reply in Support of Motion for 
Forensic Examination (“Reply Brief”) and certain accompanying exhibits under seal pursuant to 
this Court’s March 18, 2016, Protective Order and the Southern District of New York Electronic 
Case Filing Rules & Instructions 6.2. 


The Protective Order states: 


Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be accompanied by a Motion to 
Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the 

Southern District of New York. 


See Protective Order [DE 62] signed on March 17, 2016, at p. 4. Defendants have designated 
certain documents as Confidential Information and have designated Defendant’s entire 
deposition testimony as confidential. Ms. Giuffre takes no position at this time on whether 
Defendant’s designations are proper. Because of the Protective Order, however, Ms. Giuffre 
believes that she cannot presently produce or reference such documents in public court filings. 
Accordingly, as Ms. Giuffre’s Reply Brief contains material that Defendant has designated as 
confidential, she seeks leave to file the Non-Redacted Reply Brief and certain related exhibits 
under seal. 


Se Respectfully submitted,

DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 


DOC #: 
DATE FILED: MTC 








Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre (“Giuffre” or “Plaintiff”) has 
moved to compel Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Maxwell” or 
“Defendant”) to produce documents withheld on the grounds of 


privilege, (Based on the conclusions set forth. below, the motion 


is granted in part and denied in part. 





I. Prior Proceedings 


Plaintiff filed a complaint in this Court on September 21, 
2015, alleging:a single defamation claim. See Compl. As set 
forth in the Court’s February 26, 2016 Opinion denying 
Defendant’s motion to dismiss, this case concerns Defendant’s 
statements denying Plaintiff’s allegations concerning 


Defendant’s role in Plaintiff's sexual abuse as a minor. 


On February 26, 2016, Plaintiff. filed the instant motion to 
compel Defendant to respond to interrogatories to which 
Defendant has claimed the protection of the attorney-client, 
attorney-client-agent, and common interest’ privileges. Oral 
argument was held on March 17, 2016. During argument, the Court 


held that in camera review was warranted for purposes of 





determining whether privilege applied to the documents in 


question, and Defendant was directed to file any further 
submissions necessary to establish her privilege claim. On March 
31, 2016, Defendant submitted a declaration and exhibits in 


opposition to Plaintiff’s motion, at which point the matter was 


deemed fully: submitted. 


Il. The Privilege Claims at Issue 


Defendant has withheld 99 pages of emails with 
communications involving various combinations of Brett Jaffe, 
Esq. (“Jaffe”), Mark Cohen, Esq. (“Cohen”), Philip Barden 
(“Barden”), Ross Gow Gow") , Brian Basham (“Basham”), fF 

Ls facts that follow summarize 


Defendant’s assertions regarding her relationship to each of 


these individuals. 


Defendant hired Jaffe, thén of Cohen & Gresser LLP, to 
represent her in connection with legal matters in the United 
States at some indeterminate point in 2009. Def.’s Decl. of L.A.

Defendant has not established the nature of her 


relationship with Basham. 





Defendant’s withheld emails can be organized as follows}: 


1. Communications with Jaffe on March 15, 2011, #1000-19.2 

2. Communications with Gow on January 2, 2011, #1020-26. 

3. Communications with Gow and Basham on January 2, 2015, #1027- 
1028. 

4. Communications with Barden 


a. On January 10, 2015, #1045-51 
5. Communications with Barden and Gow 
a. On January 10, 2015, #1044 
b. On January 9 and 10, 2015, #1052-55 
c. On January 11, 2015, #1055-58

2015, #1030-43. 


Some emails were forwarded or carbon copied (“CC’d”) later in 
the chain, leading to some overlap and duplication. Whether one 
party or another was 4 direct recipient or a CC’d recipient of 
an email is not significant for purposes of the privilege 
analysis, as the waiver issue is determined by the purpose of 
the third-party’s inclusion in the communications, not 
necessarily whether the communication was directed toward them 


by copy or direct email. See e.g., Morgan v. New York State

III. Choice of Law _ 





Defendant has. invoked the protection. of privilege .for 
communications with. New York, counsel Jaffe and London solicitor 
Barden. Defendant.does not. dispute that. the communications with 
Jaffe are governed, by the privilege law of New York State. 
Def.’s Supp. Mem. of Law. in. Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. to Compel 
Production of Documents ,Subject to Improper Claim of Privilege, 
ECF No. 46, at 3 (“Def.’s Supp. Opp.”); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 
501; Allied Irish. Banks _.v. .Bank of Am., N.A., 240 F.R.D. 96, 102 
(S.D.N.¥. 2007) (“Because this Court’s subject matter 
jurisdiction is based-upon diversity ... . state law provides 


the rule of decision concerning the claim of attorney-client 





privilege.”). However, Defendant submits that a choice of law 


issue arises with respect to her communications with Barden. Id. 


at 35. 


Defendant has not specified whether she seeks to withhold 
decuments containing communications with Barden subject to the 
British legal-advice or litigation’ privileges. Rather, 
Defendant’s privilege log lists the “attorney-client privilege” 
with respect to the Barden communications and broadly asserts’. : 
that all privileges asserted are “pursuant to British law, 
Colorado law and NY law.” Privilege Log at 1. Defendant argues 
“Ms. Maxwell’s communications with Mr. Barden should: be. 


construed pursuant to British law.” Def.’s:Supp.: Opp. at 4. 


It. is only in Defendant’s in camera filing that. Defendant 
has provided any legal argument supporting an assertion of 


protection under British privilege law.3 


Defendant’s claim is based on two suppositions: first, that 


“'tjhe UK litigation privilege protects communications to and 


3 Defendant argued in supplemental opposition that “Ms. Maxwell 
has not had sufficient time to secure appropriate affidavits, 
documents and legal opinions concerning British law’s attorney- 
client privileges,” seeking additional time to submit these 


materials. Def.’s Supp. Opp. at 4.

from a-client and her attorney and.to a.third party[.}]” Decl. of 


L.A. Menninger in-Supp. Def.’s In.Camera Submissions (“Menninger 
Decl.”) 97 24 (emphasis in original). Second, that the scope of 
privilege is wider than explicit legal advice provided in the 
context of litigation,. encompassing communications related to 
“actual or contemplated iti ation.” Id. (emphasis in original). 
Defendant supports these arguments.,with citation to Belabel -v.. 
Air India {1988) Ch.317, Lord Taylox and. its progeny Three. 


Rivers DG: vu Bank: of England. (Disclosure): :(No.. 4), [2005] 1.A.¢. 








610 and..(Now,.10). [2004] UKHL 48 «:-- 


Lord Taylor's opinion, in Belabel explicitly addresses. 
“whether {the legal professional], privilege extends only .to'. 
communications seeking or conveying legal advice, or to all that 
passes. between: solicitor.and:client* on. matters within the 
ordinary business: of .a.solicitor.” Balabel, Ch. 317, .321~332. 
Lord Taylor discusses at ‘length whether communications between a 
solicitor and client are privileged if they do not contain 
explicit. legal..advice, ultimately deciding the scope of the 
privilege is wider. Id. at 330 (“the test is whether the 
communication or other document was made confidentially for the 
purpose of legal advice.”). However, Defendant’s citation does 
not support the statement for which it is directly cited: that 


waiver does not apply to communications including a third-party 








if for the purpose of contemplated litigation. Plaintiff, with 


the aid of British counsel and without having seen Defendant's 
British law argument, submits: an interpretation of British law 


directly contradicting Defendant's.‘ 


This precarious support provides an insufficient foundation 


for the Court to apply foreign law to Defendant’s claims. See 


Tansey v. Cochléar Ltd., No. 13-CV-4628 SJF SIL, 2014 WL 
4676588, at *4 (E.D:N.Y.° Sept. 18, 2014) (“the party relying on 


foreign law has the burden of showing such law bars production 


of documents.” (quoting BrightEdge Techs., Inc. v. 


Searchmetrics, GmbH, 14-Cv-1009-WHO, 2014 WL 3965062. *2 


(N.D.Cal. Aug.13, 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted)). 


Moreover, at least one New York court has found that 
British privilege law is “apparently similar” to New York’s. 


Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London, 


4 “Where there is no attorney involved in the communication ..., 
there can be no ‘legal advice’ privilege under English Law”; 
“[{ijJn absence of any express obligation of confidentiality, 
fPlaintiff] submits that privilege does not attach to 
communications involving Ross Gow and the lawyer.”; “Under 
English Law, communications between client and lawyer through an 
agent will be protected by legal advice privilege, but this will 
only apply in situations where the agent functions as no more 
than a mere conduit.” Pl.’s Reply in Response to Def.’s Supp. 
Mem. of L. in Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. to Compel the Production of 
Documents Subject to Improper Claim of Priv. at 4-6 (emphasis 
removed) (“Pl.’s Reply”).

interest in whether these communications remain confidential. 


The similarity between New York and British attorney-client 
privilege demonstrates that no public policy conflict exists 
Consequently, New York law applies to all of Plaintiff's 


privilege claims. 


IV. Applicable Standard 


The purpose of the attorney~ -client privilege is to 
facilitate and safeguard the provision of legal advice; “to 
ensure that one seeking legal advice will be able to confide 


fully and | freely in his attorney. ” Mitchell, 58 N.Y.2d at “373. 


New York law provides: 


Unless the client waives the privilege, an attorney or his 
or her employee, or any person who obtains without. the 
knowledge of the client evidence of a confidential 
communication made. between the attorney or his or her 
empioyee and the client in the course of professional 
employment, shall not disclose; or be allowed. to disclose 
such communication, nor shall the client be compelled to 
disclose such communication, in any action[.]} 


N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 4503{a) (1)- 
The privilege only applies to attorney-client 


communications “primarily or predominately of a legal 


character.” Rossi v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Greater N.Y., 


13 





73 NeY.2d 588, 594, 542 N.Y.S.2d.508,. 540 N.E.2d.703 (1989)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted)... -However,..reference to. non- 
legal matters ‘in communications. primarily .of-a -legal- character . 
are protected. Id. “The critical inquiry is whether, viewing: the 
lawyer's communication in its full content and context,:it was 
made in order to render legal advice or services to the client.” 


id. (quoting Spectrum Sys. Int'l Corp. ve _chem. Bank r 78 N. Y. 2d 


371, 379, 575 N.Y.S.2a 809, 581 N.E.2d 1055 (1991)). 





The presence of a “third party during | ‘communication or 


disclosure of otherwise confidential _ateorney- client 





communications to. a thira party} waives the privilege : absent an 





exception. People \ V. “Osorio, 75 N. Y. 2d 80, 84, 549 N.E. 2a 1183, 


1185 (1989). There exists an exception, referred to as the 





agency privilege, when: the third party facilitates the rendering 





of legal advice, “such as. communications: made by the client to 


the attorney": Ss. enployees, through an» interpreter, or to “one 


serving as an agent’ of either the attorney or client.” Id... 


Similarly, the common interest privilege extends the 
attorney-client privilege to “protect the confidentiality of 
communications passing from one party to the attorney for 
another party where a joint defense effort or strategy has been 


decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective 


14 








counsel.” United States v. Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237, 243 (2d Cir. 


1989). To show the common interest privilege applies, the party 
claiming its protection must show the communication was made in 
the course of the ongoing ‘common enterprise with the intention 
of furthering that enterprise. Id. A limited common purpose 
necessitating disclosure is sufficient, and “a total identity of 
interest ‘among the’ participants is not required under’ New. York 


law.”GUS Consulting. GMBH v. Chadbourne ‘& Parke LLP, 20° Misc..3d 


539, 542, °858 N.-Y.S 2d 591, 593. (Sup. Ct. 2008). 


Despite’ their shorthand namés, neither the agency privilege 
nor the common-interest privilege operate independently; both’ 
may only exist to pardon the presumptive waiver that would 
result from disclosure of otherwise privileged attorney-client 
communications to a third party when that third-party is 
included under the umbrella of the agency or common~interest 
doctrines. See U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n v. APP Int'l Fin. Co., 33 
A.D.3d 430, 431, 823 N.Y.S.2d 361, 363 (2006) (“Before a 
communication can be protected under the common interest rule, 
the communication must satisfy the reguirements of the attorney- 
client privilege.”); Don v. Singer, 19 Misc. 3d 1139(A), 866 
N.¥.S.2d 91 (Sup. Ct. 2008) (“The attorney~client privilege may 


extend to the agent of a client where the communications are 





intended to facilitate the provision of legal services to the 


client.”. (citations. and internal. quotation marks omitted)).

Jaffe’s representation, the in camera submissions demonstrate 
that: these communications were made within the context ofan 
ongoing attorney-client relationship for the purpose of 
providing legal advice related to the specific task for which 
Defendant hired Jaffe. Defendant intended that the

PURER 


Ba aS Sea NSB a a RE aka 














Defendant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the 


communications fall beneath the umbrella of attorney-client 
privilege and cannot be rehabilitated by the extension provided 


by the agency privilege. Defendant must produce the emails in 


#1020-26. 


3. Communications with Gow and Basham Must Be produced : 


These emails, documents #1027-28, are between Defendant and 
Gow, with Basham CC'd. Basham was therefore a third-party privy 


to these communications between. Defendant and Gow:.Defendant. has 





not identified Basham. Therefore, Defendant has failed to 
establish an attorney*client relationship, an attorney-client 
communication of a predominately legal character, and lack of 
waiver. Accordingly, documents #1027-28 are not privileged and 


Defendant must produce these emails. 


4. Communications with Barden Alone Are Privileged 


Defendant submits in her supplemental reply and in camera

Maxwell Decl. 9 5. Defendant’s sworn affidavit, coupled with the

5. Communications with Barden and Gow Must Be Produced 


Defendant claims the protection of the attorney-client and 
agency privileges apply to communications with Barden and Gow. 
See Privilege Log. These communications include documents #1044, 


1047-51 (as set forth above), 1052-58,39 and 1088-90. Defendant’s

. 


privilege log does not list #1063-64 as a communication between 
Defendant, Barden, and Gow,: but the chain nonetheless does 
include a message between this group, and it is analyzed 


accordingly. 


Defendant argues “Gow is the agent for Ms. Maxwell,” thus 
taking advantage of the principle ‘that attorney-client privilege 
May apply to ‘communications between an’ agent’ and the client’’s ® 
counsél. .Def.’s Supp.’ Opp. at 8. The test. dividing agency (atid 
thus privilege protection). and-lack thereof (and thus waiver) is

Defendant has failed to positively establish that Gow was 
necessary to implementing Barden’s legal advice. Defendant 
repeatedly refers to Gow as an agent and references that Gow 
provided: information to Barden at Defendant’s requests “so as to 
further Mr. Barden’s ability to give appropriate legal advice.” 
Defendant,: as cited above, relies on. fair-comment law to prove 
Gow''s necessity: in the relationship with Barden. Def.’s Supp. 
Opp. at 9. However, at best, this establishes only that Gow’s 
input. and presence. potentially added’ value to Barden’s legal 
~vadvice. “[{T]he necessity element means more than just useful: and 
convenient but requires the involvement be indispensable or 
serve some specialized purpose in facilitating attorney client 
communications.” Don, 866 N.Y.S.2d-91 (citing Nat’1 Educ. 


Training. Grp., Inc. v. Skillsoft Corp., 1993 WL 378337, *4 


(S.D.N.Y. 1999)). 


The: structure of fair comment iaw may require counsel to 
engage in public relations matters by providing a comment to 
press, but it does not follow that counsel is unable to 
communicate with his client on that issue without a public 
relations specialist. Advice on the legal implications of 
issuing a statement or its content is net predicated on pubiic 
relations implications. Likewise, it has not been established 


that the Defendant was incapable of understanding counsel's 


25 


advice on that subject without the intervention of.a “media 
agent” :or.that Gow was translating information between Barden 
and. Defendant in. the literal or figurative: sense. That Gow 
issued the statement drafted by Barden or signed a contract with 
Defendant speaks to his intimate. involvement, but. not to “his 


necessity. [Wlhere. the third party’s presence’.is merely :useful

To be sure,.some légal advice is included in the 
communications between: Barden, Defendant, .and Gow... However,. as 
the quotes above demonstrate, both Barden and:Gow provide: 
Defendant with what amounts to public relations, not legal, 
advice. It is something between business. and personal: advice, 
neither of which are privileged even when coming from counsel. 
Matter of Bekins, 62 NwY.2d -324..Furthermore, the protection of 
privilege is:presumptively narrow, not.broad. In re Shargel, 742 
F.2d 61,--62 (2d Cir. 1984) ("Since the privilege prevents 
disclosure of relevant -evidence and thus impedes the quest for 
truth, ... it must. be strictly confined within the narrowest 
possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle.” 
(citation and* internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, 
where Gow’s necessity has not been established, -Defendant cannot 
include the entire field of public relations matters into the 


realm of legal advice by virtue of a law that implicates press 


coverage. 


It has not been established that Gow’s input on public 


relations matters was necessary for Barden to communicate with 


27 





Defendant=or-iprévide*legal..advice; or that the primary. purpose’ 
of. thesé«communications»was’ the provision: of regal ;advice:. 
Consequently, Defendant has failed to demonstrate ‘the élements” 


necessary to sustain the protection of privilege with respect to 





“The communications inh’ each of these chains: include messages 


between Defendant, Barden, and Gow that were ultimately ° 


forwarded o As reasoned above, attorney-client 
privilege doés not ‘apply to the underlying emails between 


Defendant, Barden, and Gow.” Accordingly, they cannot be.

Documents #1060-61 include messages between ae

established when those years were, or even that the period of 
time encompassed the communications in question. This belief is 
completely uncorroborated, and no content within the

CIV. 13770FKRLE, 2007 WL 3226156, at *2.(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 31, 2007) 
(finding the common interest privilege did not apply where the 
document in question was not-a communication where-in the party 
claiming privilege sought''confidential legal advice). For 
example, counsel. to two*parties sharing a-common interest may 
communicate with one another ‘to provide legal.’ advice in 
furtherance’ of that’ interest, id, or two parties sharing a 
common interest may disclose the advice of ‘their counsel’ in 
furtherance of their interest. Egiazaryan, 290 F.R.D. at “434. 
However, the common interést: privilege only “operates to ‘protect 
privileges: ‘such as ‘the attorney-client’ privilege that ‘that’ would 
otherwise be waived by disclosure.” Id. These communications aré‘ 
mostly mundane exchanges and céntain'no indication that there-is 
any underlying communication from any attorney, even with 
respect to the few communications that discuss legal issues. 
Defendant has not ‘pled any other underlying privilege applies. 
Accordingly, Defendant has failed to meet her burden and these 


documents must be produced. 


e. Documents #1067~-1073 and #1074-79 Are Privileged 


Documents #1067-1073 and #1074-79 are mostly duplicative. 


In the #1074-79 series, communications between Barden, Defendant

7. “Communications with and RR Documents ©

Documents: #1030-43 contain a single email from Defendant to 


Po containing a lengthy attachment of a 


Defendant has failed to establish Re: in 


an attorney-client. relationship. Defendant has not pled any 


information regarding a °- relating to the communications 


included in the attachment. Therefore, no underlying attorney-

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this Motion to Compel All 
Attorney-Client Communications and Attorney Work Product Placed At Issue By Plaintiff and 
Her Attorneys (“Motion”), and as grounds therefore states as follows: 


CERTIFICATE OF CONFERRAL 


Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(a)(1), undersigned counsel certifies that 
she conferred with opposing counsel regarding the issues contained herein and was unable to 
resolve the matter. 

INTRODUCTION 

Plaintiff and her attorneys have tied a Gordian knot of overlapping litigations, client 
representations and joint defense agreements. Through these multiple litigations and 
representations, they attempt to strategically leverage attorney-client communications and 
attorney work product to their tactical advantage by selectively disclosing information. 
Simultaneously, they desperately seek to avoid disclosure of related materials they know are 
unfavorable, would destroy Plaintiff's claim that she has been truthful, and reveal her attorneys’ 
knowledge of Plaintiff’s false statements in multiple sworn filings and her concerted media 
campaign. The law, however, does not permit such a manipulation of the attorney-client and 
work product privileges. Rather, the selective disclosure of privileged materials results in a 
waiver of privilege as to all such material. This waiver is broad-sweeping when, as here, the 
persons asserting the privileges have affirmatively put the subject matter of the materials at issue. 

In the most recent of their serial litigations (apart from this case), Plaintiff's own 
attorneys Bradley Edwards (““Edwards) and Paul Cassell (“Cassell”) sued Harvard Law Professor 
Alan Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”) for defamation in Florida state court. The subject matter of that 
litigation concerned whether Mr. Dershowitz defamed Plaintiff's attorneys by claiming 


a) Plaintiff is lying; b) Edwards and Cassell knew Plaintiff is lying; c) Edwards and Cassell helped 
1 


Plaintiff lie and helped her concoct her stories; d) Edwards and Cassell failed to properly 
investigate Plaintiffs allegations before filing pleadings and sworn statements on Plaintiff's 
behalf; and e) Edwards and Cassell were motivated to take these actions by a desire to achieve 
personal economic gain. This litigation put at issue all communications between Plaintiff and 
her attorneys as well as her attorneys’ complete work product in the investigations of Plaintiff’ s 
stories and accusations. The truth of the matters put at issue in the Dershowitz litigation can only 


be tested by examination of privileged materials, resulting in a sweeping waiver. 


BACKGROUND FACTS RELEVANT TO DISPUTE

documents she has withheld on the basis of “AC Privilege and Work Product/joint 


defense/common interest.”’ The documents are identified as:

represented Plaintiff in attempting to obtain joinder in the pending action. On December 30, 
2014, Cassell and Edwards filed a pleading titled "Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's Motion 
Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action" in the CVRA Case. Menninger Decl., Ex C (the 
"Joinder Motion"). The Joinder Motion contained a number of allegations on behalf of “Jane 
Doe # 3,” who is actually Ms. Giuffre, the Plaintiff in this case. The allegations include that 
“Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe [#3], making her available for sex to 
politically-connected and financially-powerful people." The "politically-connected and 
financially powerful people" identified by Edwards and Cassell by name in the Joinder Motion 
as having had sexual relations with Jane Doe #3 were Prince Andrew, Duke of York ("Prince 
Andrew"), Ms. Maxwell, Jean Luc Brunel ("Brunel") and Alan Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”). Id. 
at 3-6.' 
litheaudae tn the CRA Case cubscquently struck these allegations, stating “[a]t this juncture in the proceedings, 
these lurid details are unnecessary to the determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 should be permitted 


to join Petitioners’ claim that the Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding 
with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim 


4 


Following the Joinder Motion, Dershowitz made numerous public appearances in which 
he vigorously denied the allegations, stated that Edwards and Cassell “are lying deliberately,” 
and that if Cassell and Edwards “had just done an hours’ worth of work, they would have seen 
she [Plaintiff] is lying through her teeth.” See Menninger Decl., Ex. E at 9-10. 

The Dershowitz Case 

On January 6, 2015, Edwards and Cassell initiated litigation against Dershowitz - the 
Dershowitz Case. See Menninger Decl., Ex. F. 

In the Dershowitz Case, Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation claiming 
that Dershowitz’s public statements — that they and their client were lying and that they failed to 
investigate their client’s claims — were false. The Complaint by Edwards and Cassell alleged that 
“[i]mmediately following the filing of what Dershowitz knew to be an entirely proper and well- 
founded pleading, Dershowitz initiated a massive public media assault on the reputation and 
character of Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell accusing them of intentionally lying in their 
filing, of having leveled knowingly false accusations against the Dershowitz without ever 
conducting any investigation of the credibility of the accusations, and of having acted unethically 
to the extent that their willful misconduct warranted and required disbarment.” Menninger Decl., 
Ex. F, { 17. 

Edwards and Cassell claimed as false Dershowitz’s statements that “Edwards and Cassell 
failed to minimally investigate the allegations advanced on behalf of their client [Virginia 
Giuffre] and even that they sat down with her to contrive the allegations.” Menninger Decl., Ex. 
E at 9. During the Dershowitz litigation, Edwards and Cassel responded to interrogatories and 


requests for production issued by Dershowitz. Menninger Decl., Ex. G. Interrogatory No.1 asked: 


(1.e., that they were known victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially 
considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These 
unnecessary details shall be stricken.” See Menninger Decl., Ex. D. 


> 


“State verbatim or as close as possible Each statement by Dershowitz that You assert defamed You,” 
to which Edwards and Cassel responded with nine pages of statements made by Dershowitz in the 
press where Dershowitz states: 1) Plaintiff is lying; 2) Edwards and Cassel know Plaintiff is lying; 3) 
Edwards and Cassel helped Plaintiff lie and “put words in her mouth”; and 4) Edwards and Cassel 
failed to properly investigate Plaintiff's allegations before publicizing Plaintiff's statements. 
Menninger Decl., Ex. G at 3-11. 

Edwards and Cassell further stated that the listed Dershowitz press statements were 
defamatory because “[t]he factual assertions contained or implied in the statements quoted in 
answer to Interrogatory Number | were not true, notably with regard to claims that Edwards and 
Cassell were deliberately lying, had failed to conduct an investigation of the allegations before 
filing them, had manipulated or conspired with Jane Doe No. 3 to make intentionally false 
allegations about Mr. Dershowitz, and that Plaintiffs were motivated to participate in the filing of 
knowingly false accusations against the Defendant by a desire to achieve personal economic 
gain.” Menninger Decl., Ex. G at 11, Response to Interrog. 2. 

At the time the Dershowitz Case was filed, Edwards, Cassell and Boies represented 
Plaintiff regarding “potential litigations.” See supra at { 3f. 

Plaintiff, Edwards and Cassell claim to be in a joint defense or common interest 
agreement relating to the Dershowitz Case (Menninger Decl., Ex. H at 205:19-206:7), although 
no such agreement has ever been produced. 

Plaintiff and her counsel actively participated in the Dershowitz Case. Plaintiff provided 
a declaration in the Dershowitz Case in support of the claims against Dershowitz. Menninger 
Decl., Ex. I. Plaintiff also sat for a deposition in the Dershowitz Case and testified in a manner 
expected to support Edwards’ and Cassell’s claims. Menninger Decl., Ex. H. Her counsel filed 


12 pleadings in that matter. 


I. The Attorney-Client and Work Product Privilege Standards and Limitations 
a. The Attorney-Client Privilege 

“The attorney-client privilege protects communications (1) between a client and his or 
her attorney (2) that are intended to be, and in fact were, kept confidential (3) for the purpose of 
obtaining or providing legal advice.” United States v. Mejia, 655 F.3d 126, 132 (2d Cir. 2011). 
The purpose of the privilege “is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys 
and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and 
administration of justice.” Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). “In order to 
balance this protection of confidentiality with the competing value of public disclosure, however, 
courts apply the privilege only where necessary to achieve its purpose and construe the privilege 
narrowly because it renders relevant information undiscoverable.” Mejia, 655 F.3d at 132. 
Because the privilege “stands in derogation of the search for truth so essential to the effective 
operation of any system for justice ... the privilege must be narrowly construed.” Calvin Klein 
Trademark Trust v. Wachner, 198 F.R.D. 53, 55 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (citing United States v. Nixon, 
418 U.S. 683, 710 (1974)). “The party invoking the privilege also has the burden to show that the 
privilege has not been waived.” Wultz v. Bank of China Ltd., 304 F.R.D. 384, 391 


(S.D.N.Y.2015). 


b. Work Product Privilege 
The work-product privilege protects documents either created by counsel or at counsel's 
directive, in anticipation of litigation. See In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated March 19, 2002 & 
August 2, 2002, 318 F.3d 379, 383 (2d Cir. 2003). The attorney work-product privilege “shelters 
the mental processes of the attorney, providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and 


prepare his client's case.” United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (1975). Again, the party 


asserting the work-product privilege “bears the heavy burden of establishing its applicability.” In 
re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated July 6, 2005, 510 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir. 2007). Work product 
“includes both opinion work product, such as an attorney's mental impressions or legal theories, 
and fact work product, such as factual investigation results.” Koumoulis v. Indep. Fin. Mktg. 
Grp., Inc., 295 F.R.D. 28, 39-40 (E.D.N.Y. 2013), aff'd, 29 F. Supp. 3d 142 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). 
“Both the attorney-client and work-product privileges may be waived if a party puts the 
privileged communication at issue by relying on it to support a claim or defense.” Id. 


II. Plaintiff and her Attorneys Waived Attorney-Client and Work Product Privileges 
by Putting Plaintiff’s Representation At Issue in the Dershowitz Case 


“The [attorney-client] privilege may implicitly be waived when [a party] asserts a claim 
that in fairness requires examination of protected communications.” United States v. Bilzerian, 
926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (2d Cir.1991); see also McGrath v. Nassau Cty. Health Care Corp., 204 
F.R.D. 240, 244 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (“Parties may waive any work product protection by putting 
the privileged information at issue’’). Courts determine whether a subject matter has been placed 
at issue based on whether “(1) assertion of the privilege was a result of some affirmative act, 
such as filing suit, by the asserting party; (2) through this affirmative act, the asserting party put 
the protected information at issue by making it relevant to the case; and (3) application of the 
privilege would have denied the opposing party to information vital to his defense.” Bank 
Brussels Lambert v. Credit Lyonnais (Suisse), S.A., 210 F.R.D. 506, 509-10 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) 
(quoting Hearn v. Rhay, 68 F.R.D. 574, 581 (E.D.Wash.1975)). “[C]ourts have generally 
applied the Hearn [at issue] doctrine liberally, finding a broad waiver of attorney-client privilege 
where a party asserts a position “the truth of which can only be assessed by examination of the 


privileged communication.” Bank Brussels Lambert, 210 F.R.D. at 508. 


After a party voluntarily discloses attorney-client communications or work-product 
information “to an adversary in one proceeding, it cannot withhold the same documents on the 
basis of privilege in a subsequent proceeding, even if that subsequent proceeding involves a 
different adversary.” Chevron Corp. v. Salazar, 275 F.R.D. 437, 445-46 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); see 
also In re Steinhardt Partners, 9 F.3d 230, 235 (2d. Cir. 1993) (“The waiver doctrine provides 
that voluntary disclosure of work product to an adversary waives the privilege as to other parties 
[in a subsequent proceeding].”); Urban Box Office Network, Inc. v. Interfase Managers, L.P., 

No. 01 Civ. 8854, 2004 WL 2375819, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 2004) (applying same principle 
to waive attorney-client privilege). This, of course, makes sense because “where a party 
voluntarily undertakes actions that will predictably lead to the disclosure of [a] document, then 
waiver will follow.” Chevron Corp., 275 F.R.D. at 445-46 (internal citations omitted). 

“The scope of the attorney-client privilege waiver is determined on a case by case basis 
by considering the context of the waiver and the prejudice caused to the other party by permitting 
partial disclosure of privileged communications.” McGrath, 204 F.R.D. at 244 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) 
(citing In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175, 190 (2d Cir.2000)). “As in the attorney- 
client context, fairness and prejudice concerns define the scope of any work product waiver.” Id. 
at 192. Factors considered by the Second Circuit to find a broad waiver appropriate include 
“(1) whether substantive information has been revealed; (2) prejudice to the opposing party 
caused by partial disclosure; (3) whether partial disclosure would be misleading to a court; (4) 


fairness; and (5) consistency.” Id. 


a. Plaintiff's Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege 

Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation claiming that Dershowitz’s public 
statements about their representation of client were false. At the time those claims were filed, 
Edwards and Cassell represented Plaintiff in the CVRA Case. She was also represented by 
Edwards, Cassell and Boies regarding “potential litigation.” The statements Edwards and 
Cassell claimed as false included that “Edwards and Cassell failed to minimally investigate the 
allegations advanced on behalf of their client [Virginia Giuffre] and even that they sat down with 
her to contrive the allegations.” The allegations Edwards and Cassell failed to minimally 
investigate and/or contrived where the allegations made by Plaintiff in the CVRA Joinder 
Motion. Dershowitz counterclaimed against Edwards and Cassell suing them for 1) the 
publication of the false allegations of Giuffre in the Joinder Motion and 2) defamation for their 
extra-judicial false statements concerning Dershowitz and his alleged involvement with Giuffre. 

Plaintiff and her counsel McCawley actively participated in the Dershowitz Case and 
affirmatively waived any attorney-client privilege over Plaintiff's communications. Plaintiff 
produced documents, sat for a deposition (Menninger Decl., Ex. H) and provided a sworn 
declaration (Menninger Decl., Ex. I). Through her participation in the case, Plaintiff specifically 
discussed her communications with Edwards and Cassell. In her sworn declaration, she 
discussed the following attorney communications: 

e Her conversation with Brad Edwards in 2011 when she first told him her story. This was 
followed by a telephone conversation with Edwards and his attorney, Scarola, which was 


recorded with her knowledge and consent and which has been filed in multiple court 
papers and given to the press” (Menninger Decl., Ex I at {| 55-56); 


* Edwards participated in this call as Plaintiff's attorney. Plaintiff believed that the conversation was covered by 
attorney-client privilege. See Menninger Decl., Ex. J, (email between Plaintiff and Sharon Churcher crafting 
communication to Edwards regarding publication of privileged communication). Yet, when the conversation was 
sent to the press, and used in later court filings, Plaintiff did nothing to stop the publication of this privileged 


10 


e Her discussions with Edwards and Cassell of her representation in the CVRA Case (id. at 


{| 61); 
e Her directions to counsel to pursue criminal charges (id. at { 65); 


e Inher conversations with her attorneys “no one” has “pressured” her to identify 
Dershowitz as a person who allegedly abused her (id. at { 67); 


e Her authorization to her attorney to file various affidavits including her stories (id. at 
{| 67); 


e Her attorneys’ belief in the truth of her statements (id. at { 68). 


Plaintiff's waiver of her attorney-client privilege was solidified during her deposition in 
the Dershowitz Case. At the conclusion of questioning by Dershowitz’s counsel, and after off 
the records discussions between and among McCawley, Edwards, Cassell and Jack Scarola 
(counsel for Edwards and Cassell), Mr. Scarola then asked Plaintiff a series of questions directly 
discussing her communications with her counsel. McCawley made no objection and Plaintiff 


responded to each question. Scarola asked if Edwards pressured or encouraged her to lie: 


Menninger Decl., Ex. H at 202:5-202:12. Scarola asked similar questions concerning Cassell. 
Id. at 202-03. The questioning, however, was not limited to Plaintiff's conversations with 
Edwards and Cassell. Scarola’s final question, again answered without objection by McCawley, 


was: 





communication. This alone is sufficient to waive the attorney-client privilege communication as between Edwards 
and Plaintiff. See infra, p. 19-20. 


11 





Menninger Decl., Ex. H at 203:18-204:7. 


There is no mechanism by which Plaintiff could respond to any of these questions with 
the answer “never” unless she is recollecting and relying on the content of each and every 
communication she had with Edwards, Cassell and any other person (including each and every 
one of her attorneys) about the “topics covered” in the deposition. The topics covered in the 
deposition were wide ranging including the full breadth of statements she and her counsel had 
made in the CVRA Case, identification of the “high powered” individuals with whom she claims 
to have had sexual relations, when and how she allegedly met Epstein, the timing and specifics 
of her alleged encounters with Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, Maxwell and others, and her 
interviews with and statements to media outlets. In other words, the topics included every story 
Plaintiff has ever told concerning the time she claims she was a “sex slave.” 

Notably, the Special Master overseeing Plaintiff's deposition in the Dershowitz Case 


immediately recognized the waiver. On re-direct, the following colloquy occurred: 





Menninger Decl., Ex. H at 205:15-206:10. 


This testimony directly placed Plaintiff’s attorney-client communications and work 
product at issue in the Dershowitz Case. Edwards and Cassell took the affirmative position that 
Dershowitz’s statements that Edwards and Cassell helped Plaintiff fabricate her stories were 
false and defamatory. See Menninger Decl., Ex E, p. 2 (“Dershowitz went so far as to repeatedly 
accuse Edwards and Cassell of criminal misconduct in actively suborning perjury and fabricating 
the allegations of misconduct against him - acts that would warrant their disbarment from the 
legal profession. .. . Put simply, Dershowitz has made highly defamatory allegations that have 
no basis in fact”). Communications between Plaintiff and her attorney were a central issue in the 
claims brought by Edwards and Cassell, and Plaintiff voluntarily testified regarding those 
communications. 

Plaintiff was acutely aware of how the information was being utilized in the Dershowitz 
Case. According to Plaintiff, she is a party to a joint defense or common interest agreement with 
Messrs. Edwards and Cassell. When the Dershowitz Case was filed, a mere week after the filing 
of the Joinder Motion on Plaintiff's behalf, Edwards and Cassell represented Plaintiff, who 
Dershowitz had also threatened to sue. Thus, Edwards and Cassell allegedly act both as 
Plaintiffs attorneys and her joint-defense or common interest partners. Plaintiff was aware that 
what was, or in this case was allegedly not, said between her and her attorney would be 
affirmatively used by her counsel/joint defense partners in support of their claims. She 


authorized the disclosure and testified, both with the assistance of McCawley. 


13 


Plaintiff, on behalf of her joint defense partners, provided evidence to support the factual 
claim neither Edwards or Cassell (nor anyone else) asked Plaintiff to lie about her stories of 
alleged sexual abuse and trafficking. The only way the truth of that issue can be tested is 
through the examination of all her communications about her stories, with attorneys or 
otherwise. See Bowne v. AmBase Corporation, 150 F.R.D. 465, 488 (S.D.N.Y.1993), aff'd by 
161 F.R.D. 258 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (otherwise privileged communications put in issue where party 
“asserts a factual claim the truth of which can only be assessed by examination of a privileged 
communication”); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (2d Cir.1991) (“[a] defendant 
may not use the privilege to prejudice his opponent's case or to disclose some selected 
communications for self-serving purposes. Thus, the privilege may implicitly be waived when 
defendant asserts a claim that in fairness requires examination of protected communications.”); 
In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 101—02 (“[I]t has been established law for a hundred years that 
when the client waives the privilege by testifying about what transpired between her and her 
attorney, she cannot thereafter insist that the mouth of the attorney be shut. From that has grown 
the rule that testimony as to part of a privileged communication, in fairness, requires production 
of the remainder.”); United States v. Schmidt, 105 F.3d 82, 89 (2d Cir. 1997) (criminal defendant 
who testified that she was never advised by her attorney of the fifth amendment implications of 
proceeding pro se put at issue all communications with her former attorney and her knowledge 
of the law as informed by her attorney-client communications). 

“(T]he attorney-client privilege cannot at once be used as a shield and a sword.... A 
defendant may not use the privilege to prejudice his opponent's case or to disclose some selected 
communications for self-serving purposes.” Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (2d Cir. 1991) 


(internal citations omitted); Locascio, 357 F.Supp.2d 536, 550 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (“The privilege 


14 


may not simultaneously be used as a shield and a sword; where a defendant opens the door by 
waiving the attorney-client privilege, . . . the [party] cannot open the door only to the information 
he would like to admit.”) Plaintiff has used her attorney communications as a sword on behalf of 
her joint defense partners, and therefore her communications with her attorneys are no longer 
shielded. 

Plaintiff also testified that she shared her conversations and communications with 
Edwards to unrelated third parties. In particular, she shared her communications with a reporter 
for the Daily Mail Online, Sharon Churcher. See Menninger Decl., Ex. K, at 297:5-300:6. There 
is no doubt that sharing attorney-client communications with a third-party, particularly when that 
third party is a member of the press, acts to waive any claim of privilege. Schaeffler v. United 
States, 806 F.3d 34, 40 (2d Cir.2015). (“A party that shares otherwise privileged communications 
with an outsider is deemed to waive the privilege by disabling itself from claiming that the 
communications were intended to be confidential.”). 

b. Edwards and Cassell’s Waivers of Attorney-Client and Work Product Privilege in 
the Dershowitz Case 

In addition to Plaintiff's direct waiver, Plaintiff's counsel/joint defense partners Edwards 
and Cassell waived both attorney-client privilege and protection of their work product by putting 
those matters at issue in the Dershowitz Case. The scope of the subject matter put at issue in the 
Dershowitz Case could not be broader. Edwards and Cassell pleaded and argued at every 
conceivable turn that: 1) they had a good faith belief that Ms. Giuffre’s allegations — 
communicated to them by Giuffre -- were true; 2) they conducted a thorough investigation of 
Ms. Giuffre’s claims (their work product regarding Plaintiff and her allegations); 3) that Ms. 


Giuffre and her story were credible; 4) they did not have any communications or encourage 


15 


Plaintiff to fabricate facts or portions of her stories; and 5) they were not motivated in taking 
their actions by potential financial gain. Edwards and Cassell point to both communications 
with Plaintiff and their own work product in an attempt to prove their claims. 

By way of example, in the Motion for Summary Judgement in the Dershowitz Case, 
Edwards and Cassell make the following assertions, citing attorney-client-privileged 


communications and work product documents in support of their claims and defenses: 


e “Ms. Giuffre has submitted a sworn affidavit, not only attesting to the truthfulness of her 


allegations against Dershowitz but also about the fact that she told her lawyers about 
these claims.” (emphasis supplied) (attorney-client communications); 


e “The assertions of sexual abuse are more than adequately corroborated by compelling 
circumstantial evidence which is detailed at length by Cassell in his deposition.” (work 
product/investigations); 


e “Regardless of whether Dershowitz sexually abused Ms. Giuffre, Edwards and Cassell 
clearly had a good faith basis for relying on the sworn representations of their client.” 
(attorney-client communications, attorney thought process); 


e “Edwards and Cassell had clearly conducted extensive investigation into the basis for Ms. 
Giuffre's allegations” (work product); 


e “the undisputed record evidence establishes that Edwards and Cassell had every right 
following their detailed investigation to rely on Ms. Giuffre's credibility” (attorney-client 
communication, work-product and investigations, thought process and credibility 
assessments); 


e “The good faith basis for Edwards and Cassell's reliance on Giuffre's allegations is laid 
out in detail by Professor Cassell in more than 50 pages of sworn testimony during his 
deposition. See Depo. Transcript of Paul Cassell (Oct. 16 & 17, 2015), at 61-117 (Exhibit 
#3)” (attorney investigative activities, work-product and attorney thought process based 
on what they “knew” through attorney-client communications). 


e “Edwards and Cassell clearly had a powerful basis for believing their client's allegation 
that she had been sexually abused by Dershowitz, particularly where she had made this 
allegation to them as far back as 2011” (attorney-client communications) 


e “Dershowitz made false and defamatory statements by alleging that two experienced and 
capable attorneys who thoroughly investigated and believed Ms. Giuffre's allegations in 
good faith should be disbarred” (work-product, investigation of alleged acts and 
investigation of credibility). 


Menninger Decl., Ex E, at 1-13. 


16 


In addition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, Mr. Cassell in his deposition spent 
more than 50 pages detailing the investigations and assessment of all of the evidence used as a 
factual basis for the Joinder Motion in the CVRA Case on behalf of Plaintiff. Menninger Decl., 
Ex. Lat 61-117. During this soliloquy, Cassell details his and Edwards thought processes in 
assessing the claims, their evaluation of the evidence they reviewed, and all other information 
that he had to believe Plaintiffs stories. He specifically refers to Plaintiff, their evaluation of the 
evidence in light of the information they “knew” about Plaintiff, and their evaluation and thought 
process of how the evidence supported her stories. Of course, the information they “knew” 
about Plaintiff was a direct result of her attorney-client communications with them, and their 
evaluation of that evidence in the case is clearly work product. In reciting the work product he 


9499 


believes supports “Virginia’s” story, Cassell states that this is “important to Virginia” and “TI 
want to do a good job for Virginia Roberts on -- on representing all the -- the evidence that is 
available to support her.” Menninger Decl.., Ex. L at 102:1-3 & 118:7-8. Having put these 
matters directly at issue, and utilizing both their work-product and attorney-client 
communications in support of the claims, there is a complete waiver of protection over 1) the 


content of communications between Plaintiff and her attorneys, and 2) her attorneys’ work 


product and thought process in investigating and “reasonable belief” in the claims.° 





Ina joint press release relating to the settlement of the Dershowitz Case, Plaintiff and her attorneys again 
affirmatively cite to Plaintiff's communications with them, their investigation of her statements, and their 
assessment of her credibility. The references include the time frame prior to their initial filing as well as information 
discovered throughout the course of the Dershowitz Cases. In that press release, Edwards and Cassel stated 
“Edwards and Cassell maintain that they filed their client's allegations in good faith and performed the necessary 
due diligence to do so, and have produced documents detailing those efforts.” Menninger Decl., Ex. M, p.1. The 
press release continues in stating that it was a “mistake” to have filed sexual misconduct allegations against 
Dershowitz citing, among other things, “the records and other documents produced by the parties.” Jd. at 2. These 
public statements provide a further waiver over the work product that led to the public acknowledgement that filing 
the lawsuit and reliance on Plaintiff's allegations was a “mistake.” 


17 


c. The elements for finding an at issue waiver are satisfied 

As discussed above, “courts have generally applied the [at issue] doctrine liberally, 
finding a broad waiver of attorney-client privilege where a party asserts a position “the truth of 
which can only be assessed by examination of the privileged communication.” Bank Brussels 
Lambert, 210 F.R.D. at 508. All of the factors for waiver have been met: “(1) assertion of the 
privilege was a result of some affirmative act, such as filing suit, by the asserting party; (2) 
through this affirmative act, the asserting party put the protected information at issue by making 
it relevant to the case; and (3) application of the privilege would have denied the opposing party 
to information vital to his defense.” Jd. 210 F.R.D. at 509-10. Here, Edwards and Cassell, with 
the full knowledge and consent of Plaintiff, took the affirmative act of filing and participating in 
the Dershowitz Case. Through this affirmative act, they put at issues what Plaintiff told her 
attorneys, whether it was true, whether her attorneys helped her concoct additional allegations 
that would help her position, whether they adequately investigated her claims, their basis for 
believing Plaintiff was credible, and if they and their client were motivated to file false claims by 
a desire for financial gain. 

As discussed above, Plaintiff voluntarily and affirmatively waived the attorney-client 
privilege through her testimony. That alone is sufficient to find an at issue waiver. Plaintiff also 
permitted the waiver of the attorney-client privilege by permitting Edwards and Cassell to put 
her communications with them and her attorneys’ work product at issue with her full knowledge 
and consent. Plaintiff is a party to a joint defense agreement with Edwards and Cassell. She and 
her attorneys were involved in communication about the Dershowitz Case beginning in January 
2015. The case was preemptively filed to beat Dershowitz to the courthouse, before he could act 


on his public statements that he intended to sue both Plaintiff and her attorneys for, among other 


18 


things, defamation. Plaintiff did nothing to stop her counsel from filing the Complaint, despite 
the fact that it would necessarily put her communications with her counsel at issue. And, she 
actively participated in the litigation. Indeed, the testimony of Cassell makes clear that the 
purpose of the litigation was for Plaintiffs benefit, and that he wanted to do a “good job” for her. 

Normally, an attorney cannot waive the attorney-client privilege without his client’s 
knowledge and consent. In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 101. But, “[a] client may nonetheless by 
his actions impliedly waive the privilege or consent to disclosure.” Jd., 828 F.2d 94, 101 (2d Cir. 
1987) (citing See United States ex rel Edney v. Smith, 425 F.Supp. 1038, 1052 (E.D.N.Y. 1976) 
(implied waiver), aff'd, 556 F.2d 556 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 958 (1977); Drimmer v. 
Appleton, 628 F.Supp. 1249, 1252 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (implied consent); Wigmore, supra, § 2327)). 
In certain circumstances, an attorney may have “an implied authority to waive the privilege on 
behalf of his client.” Drimmer, 628 F.Supp. at 1251; see also In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 101. 
“Tt is the client's responsibility to ensure continued confidentiality of his communications.” Id. 
Ifa client is aware of her attorney’s waiver of privilege and takes no action to preserve 
confidentiality, the privilege is lost. Id.; In re Horowitz, 482 F.2d 72, 82 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 
414 US. 867 (1973) (“i]t is not asking too much to insist that if a client wishes to preserve the 
privilege under such circumstances, he must take some affirmative action to preserve 
confidentiality”). 

This situation is analogous to a client asserting advice of counsel as a defense, a situation 
in which an at issue waiver of the full scope of attorney-client communications is automatic. See 
Bilzerian, 926 F.2d at 1292 (defendant’s testimony that he thought his actions were legal would 
have put his knowledge of the law and the basis for his understanding of what the law required 


into issue, directly implicating his conversations with counsel); Chin v. Rogoff & Co., P.C., No. 


19 


05 CIV. 8360(NRB), 2008 WL 2073934, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2008) (in suit for damages 
against tax advisor for negligence in providing tax advice, reliance and causation could only be 
assessed through invading the attorney-client privilege and examining the nature of counsel’s 
advice to determine different advice was given by attorneys). The at issue waiver is complete 
“even if a party does not attempt to make use of a privileged communication” Bowne of New 
York City, Inc. v. AmBase Corp., 150 F.R.D. 465, 488 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (discussing Bilzerian, 
926 F.2d 1285); Chin, 2008 WL 2073934, at *6 (waiver occur even where client does not 
reference attorney communications if review of communications is necessary to establish an 
element of a claim). Here, Edwards and Cassell put the issue of their “good faith” reliance on 
Plaintiffs communications to them affirmatively at issue, as well as their investigation of what 
she told them in those communications. Having done so with Plaintiff's knowledge and consent, 
and without her protest, the waiver is complete. 

The application of the privilege here, after it has been selectively waived, denies Ms. 
Maxwell information vital to her defense. By way of very limited example, in the case at bar, 
Plaintiff claims that she was defamed when Ms. Maxwell stated that the allegations Plaintiff 
made in the Joinder Motion, included allegations regarding Dershowitz, Ms. Maxwell and Prince 
Andrew, were false. In the Joinder Motion Edwards and Cassell boldly state “Epstein required 
Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a 
minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.” Menninger Decl., Ex. C at 4. Edwards and Cassell, however, had doubts about 
Plaintiff's allegations based on their own investigation, including whether Dershowitz and 
Plaintiff were ever on Epstein’s plane together. Cassell identified flight logs Edwards and he 


reviewed as supporting the allegations made by Plaintiff. Menninger Decl., Ex. L at 69-70. He 


20 


admits, however, that there is not a single log entry that put Dershowitz and Plaintiff on the same 
plane.* Having put at issue their investigation and “good faith belief” in Plaintiff's stories, they 
must provide all information about anything that both supports and undermines Plaintiffs story 
and their own belief in the credibility of that story. 

Plaintiff will undoubtedly attempt to prop-up her claims that she was telling the truth 
through use of the investigative material, work product, mental impressions and opinions on her 
credibility offered by her attorneys/joint defense partners, Edwards and Cassell. Ms. Maxwell 
cannot be denied access to information showing her attorney’s work and investigation shows 
Plaintiffs stories were fabricated, including the details uncovered demonstrating Plaintiff's lack 
of credibility. 

Each of the factors considered by the Second Circuit to find a broad waiver weighs in 
favor of finding such a waiver here. The factors are “(1) whether substantive information has 
been revealed; (2) prejudice to the opposing party caused by partial disclosure; (3) whether 
partial disclosure would be misleading to a court; (4) fairness; and (5) consistency.” McGrath v. 
Nassau Cty. Health Care Corp., 204 F.R.D. 240, 244. 

Cassell and Edwards have revealed in extensive detail their work-product demonstrating 
why they believed Plaintiff’s allegations and incorporated them in the Joinder Motion. It would 
be prejudicial for Plaintiff to be able to support her claim in this case that she is not a liar using 
her attorney’s testimony and work product, while preventing discovery of work-product and 


communications that would prove otherwise or cast doubts on Plaintiff's credibility. It would be 





3 My question, Mr. Cassell, is: You reviewed the flight logs, correct? 

A. Correct. 

Q. You reviewed them in some detail, correct? 

A. Correct. 

Q. Is there any entry on those flight lines -- logs that you read as putting Professor Dershowitz and Miss Roberts on 
the same plane? 

A. No. 

Menninger Decl., Ex. L 206:3-11. 


21 


misleading to the court or any jury to hear testimony from Plaintiff's counsel about all the factual 
basis, work product and thought process on which they relied in making the allegations in the 
Joinder Motion, but refusing to permit Ms. Maxwell discovering or presenting contradicting 
information that Plaintiff's attorneys had, including information that led them to conclude that it 
was a “mistake” to have filed sexual misconduct allegations against Dershowitz. Fairness and 
consistency require that Plaintiff and her attorneys be required to disclose all work product and 
attorney-client communications relating their investigations of Plaintiffs statements and story as 
alleged in the CVRA Case, their investigations of the allegations, their assessment of the 
credibility of the allegations, and contradictory evidence uncovered. 


II. There is No Privilege as to Communications with Scarola 


Plaintiff listed on her privilege log Jack Scarola, Edwards and Cassell’s attorney, as an 
individual who received or sent communications or documents relating to the CVRA Case. The 
log does not state what these documents are, instead including them as part of the “categorical” 
logging. The “Types of Privileges” identified are Attorney Client, Work Product, and Joint 
Defense/Common Interest. It is entirely unclear how any of these protections can be invoked 


regarding communications including Scarola or over documents provided by or to him. 


a. There is no Attorney-Client Relationship 


Plaintiff specifically states in her interrogatory responses that Scarola is not and has never 
been her attorney. Thus, there can be no attorney-client-communications between Plaintiff and 


Scarola. If there were, Plaintiff has clearly and voluntarily waived any privilege. 


22 


b. Work Product Privilege has been Waived 

In 2011, Scarola acted as Edward’s attorney in a case captioned Epstein v. Edwards, Case 
No. 502009CA040800XXXMB, in the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm 
Beach County, Florida (the “Epstein v. Edwards Case.”). That action is still pending. According 
to the most recent discovery responses, Edwards represented Plaintiff in the CVRA Case at the 
same time. SOF, {(d). 

On April 7, 2011, Edwards, Scarola and Plaintiff had a telephone conversation, recorded 
with the knowledge and consent of Plaintiff. Menninger Decl., Ex N at 1. The content of the 
conversation is a detailed interview of Plaintiff recounting her story of her time with Epstein. 
The transcript of that conversation, clearly marked “Work Product,” has been produced widely 
and attached to multiple court filings. It was used affirmatively in the Epstein v. Edwards Case 
and filed on May 17, 2011 in that case. See Menninger Decl., Ex. O (Notice of Filing). It was 
also used affirmatively in the CVRA Case. See Menninger Decl., Ex. P, DE #290, Exhibit 3. It 
was produced in this case and in the Dershowitz Case by Plaintiff and her counsel. See 
Menninger Decl., Ex. Q. It apparently was also transmitted to the press. See Menninger Decl., 
Ex. J. 

As discussed above, putting information contained in this “work product” document at 
issue waives of any protection and extends to any and all work product of Scarola related to 


Plaintiff or her claims and stories. 


c. There is no basis to claim common interest or joint defense privilege 
It bears repeating that “[t]he party asserting the privilege ... bears the burden of 


establishing its essential elements.” Mejia, 655 F.3d at 132; see also Wultz v. Bank of China Ltd., 


23 


304 F.R.D. 384, 391 (S.D.N.Y.2015) (“The party invoking the privilege also has the burden to 
show that the privilege has not been waived.”’). 

Plaintiff provides no basis for claiming a common interest or joint defense with anyone 
related to the CVRA case. The only two people Scarola represents, to Ms. Maxwell’s 
knowledge, are Edwards and Cassell. They are the attorneys in the CVRA case, and by 
definition should not have a personal or common interest with the parties in that litigation. 
Regardless, it is Plaintiff's burden to establish that such and interest exists, who is involved, and 
Scarola’s role. Having failed to provide any of the information necessary to establish the 
applicability of these privileges, they are waived. See S.E.C. v. Yorkville Advisors, LLC, 300 
F.R.D. 152, 162 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (failure to provide adequate descriptions of the subject matter, 
authors and recipients of the withheld documents resulted in waiver of privilege). There is 


simply no basis for withholding any communication with or work product of Scarola. 


CONCLUSION 


Plaintiff and her lawyers waived any privilege as to their communications related to the 
subject matters of (a) the CVRA litigation and (b) the Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz Case. 
Similarly, Plaintiff's lawyers waived any claim of work product to material gathered in relation 
to those litigations. 

Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court enter an order finding (a) a waiver of 
the attorney-client privilege as to the subject matter of the CVRA and Dershowitz litigations and 
(b) a work product exemption for materials gathered in relation to those matters. She further 
requests an Order directing Plaintiff to provide Ms. Maxwell with all documents as to which 


such the attorney-client privilege and work product have been waived.
