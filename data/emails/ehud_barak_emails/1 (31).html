 valuation was estimated at $3,338,710, and $1.5MM investment was 
intended to be 31% of Company on a fully diluted basis.&nbsp; Now $1.5MM buys
 25% on a fully diluted basis based on a $4.5 MM company valuation. 
&nbsp;However, to get EB up to 31% he is being offered up to 6% of ordinary 
shares for serving as director.&nbsp; The 6 percent vests in 8 equal 
quarterly installments over 2 years.&nbsp; However, by doing it this way, I 
believe the warrant exercise prices which are based on a percentage of 
the original purchase price per share will start at a higher exercise 
price per share.</div><div><br></div><div>2.<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>Regarding
 warrant exercise prices, you may recall that in the last iteration of 
the term sheet, the investor was to be given two sets of warrants: one 
set of $1MM worth of warrants exercisable at any time over a 4 year 
period at 150% of the purchase price per share of the preferred shares 
in this investment; and the second set of $2.5MM of warrants exercisable
 at any time over a 4 year period at 175% of the purchase price per 
share of the preferred shares in this investment.&nbsp; Now this has been 
changed so that only for the 1st two years of the 4 year exercise period
 are the warrants exercisable at 150% and 175% of the purchase price per
 share, respectively.&nbsp; In the third year the exercise prices increase to
 195% and 225%, respectively, of the original purchase price per share, 
and in the fourth year, the exercise prices increase to 240% and 275%, 
respectively of the purchase price per share.&nbsp; If the original intent 
was for the warrants to enable EB to acquire a majority interest of the 
Company, with the increase in the original purchase price per share, 
while the aggregate dollar amount that may be exercised remains the 
same, even with a full exercise of all $3.5 MM of warrants in the first 
two years (i.e., with an exercise price at 150% and 175% of the purchase
 price per share), it does not appear that EB will acquire a majority 
interest.&nbsp; He certainly won’t when the exercise prices are increased in 
years 3 and 4 of the warrant exercise period. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>3.<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>There
 is a note that is deleted about there being a finders fee payable to 
Echar Erez under which he was supposed to receive cash in the amount of 
2.5% of the investment amount, plus options for 2.5% of the investment 
shares.&nbsp; Although the note was deleted, I wonder whether that fee is 
being paid somewhere.</div><div><br></div><div>4.<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>They
 put a time limit of 2 years on price anti-dilution.&nbsp; They also changed 
the description of the price anti-dilution from broad based weighted 
average to narrow based weighted average.</div><div><br></div><div>5.<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>Whereas
 previously any deemed liquidation event would require EB approval, now 
only liquidation events where EB would receive less than 400% of his 
investment require EB approval.</div><div><br></div><div>6.<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>Whereas
 budget variations required EB approval now only if the budget varies by
 10% in any given month (and not in the aggregate) would prior approval 
be required.</div><div><br></div><div>7. &nbsp; incurring any single debt of 
$100K or more would require EB approval.&nbsp; Obviously this can be avoided 
with a series of separate debt transactions.</div><div><br></div><div>8.<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>Financial
 reporting that was unaudited monthly reports 15 days after the end of 
every month, unaudited quarterly financials 45 days after end of each of
 the first, second and third quarters and audited annual financials 60 
days after the fiscal year end has been changed to 30 days for monthly 
reports, 60 days for unaudited quarterly financials and 90 days for 
audited annual financials.</div><div><br></div><div>9.<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>Auto
 conversion of the ordinary shares was originally to take place if the 
Company netted $10MM in an IPO at a pre-money valuation of the Company 
of at least $50MM.&nbsp; Those numbers have now been changed to auto 
conversion upon the company netting $30MM in an IPO at a pre-money 
valuation of at least $100MM.</div><div><br></div><div>10.&nbsp; The term 
sheet originally provided that founders could not sell any of their 
holdings until the earlier of the expiration of four years, a qualified 
IPO or a Deemed Liquidation of the Company.&nbsp; The revised term sheet 
allows the Founders after two years to sell their holdings until they 
receive $300,000, but each of the Founders may not sell more than 10% of
 his or her holdings.&nbsp; Any such transfers will be subject to the right 
of first refusal of each 5% shareholder to purchase a pro rata portion 
of the shares to be sold by the Founder, but such transfers will not be 
subject to the EB’s tag along rights.</div><div>&nbsp;<span style="white-space:pre-wrap">	</span>&nbsp;</div>
