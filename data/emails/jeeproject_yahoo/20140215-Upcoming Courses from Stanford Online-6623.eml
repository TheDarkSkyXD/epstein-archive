   Technology Entrepreneurship

   Chuck Eesley

   Started February 2nd

      [tech-entrepreneurship-2-feature.jpg]

      This course introduces the fundamentals of technology entrepreneurship,
      pioneered in Silicon Valley and now spreading across the world.
      Participants will learn the process technology entrepreneurs use to
      start companies, which involves taking a technology idea and finding a
      commercial opportunity, gathering resources such as talent and capital,
      figuring out how to sell and market the idea, and managing rapid
      growth. The six-week course provides practical experience alongside
      theory. Participants will form teams that work on startup projects. The
      last time this course was offered, 40,000 participants from around the
      world formed teams and the top teams were matched with Silicon Valley
      mentors. The best teams at the end of the class pitched their ideas to
      investors.

   Keith Devlin

   Started February 3rd

      [math-thinking.jpg]

      This course is designed to develop a valuable mental ability--a
      powerful way of thinking that humans have developed over three thousand
      years and one that can help solve problems that arise in the everyday
      world. Participants will learn a key feature of mathematical thinking,
      which is thinking "outside the box." The ten-week course covers
      language analysis, working with quantifiers, proofs, elements of number
      theory, and mathematical analysis.

   Machine Learning

   Andrew Ng

   Starts March 3rd

      [ml-featured.jpg]

      Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without
      being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has
      given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web
      search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.
      Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens
      of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is
      the best way to make progress toward human-level Artificial
      Intelligence (AI). In this ten-week course, participants will learn
      about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice
      implementing them and getting them to work. More importantly,
      participants will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of
      learning, and gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and
      powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, course
      participants will learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices
      in innovation as they pertain to machine learning and AI.

   Starts March 17th

      [coding-together-featured.jpg]

      This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the
      implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical
      analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees,
      types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis,
      program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a
      result, participants will learn how a program written in a high-level
      language designed for humans is systematically translated into a
      program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. The
      eleven-week course includes video lectures, homework, quizzes, two
      exams, a midterm, and a final.

   Starts March 26th

      [constructive-classroom-featured.jpg]

      Under the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, students are
      expected to understand complex problems, engage in constructive
      classroom conversations about math, and clearly support their reasoning
      with evidence. This course will provide teachers with a range of
      practical tools for gathering and analyzing language samples that show
      how students learn during math instruction and what support students
      need in elementary math classrooms. Topics include developing students'
      language for engaging in the eight Common Core mathematical practices,
      fostering constructive conversations, and communicating evidence and
      reasoning. This course will also enable teachers to collaborate with
      other educators and build professional relationships that result in an
      online community focused on improving students' abilities to use rich
      academic language to learn and demonstrate learning of mathematical
      skills and concepts.

   Daniel McFarland

   Starts March 31st

      [org-analysis-featured.jpg]

      This course focuses on the ubiquity and variability of organizations
      and the resulting complexity and confusion in the organizational
      challenges we regularly face. Participants will consider cases of
      various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians
      attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators
      dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create
      a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two
      universities trying to gain international standing by performing a
      merger. The ten-week course provides grounding in relevant
      organizational theories as a means of systematically identifying
      important features of an organization and the events transforming it,

      science. It builds on educators' capacity to use, develop, and
      implement curriculum-embedded performance assessments that fit local
      contexts. Participants will engage in activities that include
      evaluating sample performance tasks and developing and implementing a
      performance task that is aligned with a specific curricular unit as
      well as performance outcomes in order to ensure students use and apply
      critical skills and knowledge to demonstrate understanding. The
      nine-week course uses a learning-centered approach where assessments
      are not only about measuring learning, but are also learning events.

      With the power to cross borders and languages, music serves as a
      compelling tool for unlocking creative potential. Using the lens of the
      future of music in our lives, this six-week course explores several
      factors that stimulate creativity in individuals, teams, and
      organizations. Featuring interviews with Stanford music scholars, music
      industry executives, and world-class artists from Warner Music Group,
      each session will focus on a different variable related to creativity,
      such as reframing problems, connecting and combining ideas, and
      challenging assumptions. All of the projects in this experiential
      course will deal with some aspect of music, including listening,
      creating, and sharing. No musical talent is required --just an interest
      in exploring the role that music plays in our lives. The six-week

Participants will learn the process technology entrepreneurs use to start companies, which involves taking a technology idea and finding a commercial opportunity, gathering resources such as talent and capital, figuring out how to sell and market the idea, and managing rapid growth. The six-week course provides practical experience alongside theory. Participants will form teams that work on startup projects. The last time this course was offered, 40,000 participants from around the world formed teams and the top teams were matched with Silicon Valley mentors. The best teams at the end of the class pitched their ideas to investors.  <br>

                <p style="float: left; width: 390px;margin:0; padding:0;margin-left: 10px;">Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress toward human-level Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this ten-week course, participants will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work. More importantly, participants will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of learning, and gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, course participants will learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as they pertain to machine learning and AI. <br>

This course will provide teachers with a range of practical tools for gathering and analyzing language samples that show how students learn during math instruction and what support students need in elementary math classrooms. Topics include developing students' language for engaging in the eight Common Core mathematical practices, fostering constructive conversations, and communicating evidence and reasoning. This course will also enable teachers to collaborate with other educators and build professional relationships that result in an online community focused on improving students' abilities to use rich academic language to learn and demonstrate learning of mathematical skills and concepts.  <br>

                <p style="float: left; width: 390px;margin:0; padding:0;margin-left: 10px;">This course focuses on the ubiquity and variability of organizations and the resulting complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly face. Participants will consider cases of various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms trying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger. The ten-week course provides grounding in relevant organizational theories as a means of systematically identifying important features of an organization and the events transforming it, and predicting which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.  <br>

General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games based solely on formal game descriptions supplied at "runtime." (They don't know the rules until the game starts.) Course participants will learn GGP theory and develop GGP programs capable of competing against humans and against other programs. GGP provides a theoretical framework that has practical applications in areas like business and law. <br>

Using the lens of the future of music in our lives, this six-week course explores several factors that stimulate creativity in individuals, teams, and organizations. Featuring interviews with Stanford music scholars, music industry executives, and world-class artists from Warner Music Group, each session will focus on a different variable related to creativity, such as reframing problems, connecting and combining ideas, and challenging assumptions. All of the projects in this experiential course will deal with some aspect of music, including listening, creating, and sharing. No musical talent is required --just an interest in exploring the role that music plays in our lives. The six-week course includes weekly projects that will each take approximately 5 hours to complete.<br>
