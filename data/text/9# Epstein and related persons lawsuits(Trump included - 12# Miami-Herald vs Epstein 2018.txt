Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 6 of 21 


PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 


Pursuant to Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Miami Herald Media 
Company (the "Miami Herald"), and Julie Brown, investigative journalist for the Miami Herald 
("Julie Brown" and together with Miami Herald, the "Intervenors"), respectfully submit this 
memorandum of law in support of their motion to intervene and unseal all of the documents in the 
above-captioned action that have been filed under seal or redacted. These judicial documents are 
germane to the Miami Herald's ongoing coverage of dozens of underage minors who were victims 
of Jeffrey Epstein, the South Florida financier who pleaded guilty in 2008 to solicitation of minors 
for prostitution and was suspected of involvement in a larger sex-trafficking organization. These 
documents are presumptively public, under both the common law and the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution, but have been sealed pursuant to an improvidently granted protective 
order (ECF No. 62) (the "Protective Order") that allowed the parties to the above-caption actions 
("Parties") to designate information as confidential without the particularized judicial scrutiny 
required by the law prior to sealing. Though two previous motions to unseal have been denied, 
the reasoning underlying the denial — the imminence of trial, and potential impact on a jury — is no 
longer relevant because the case has been settled. 

The Parties in this action have made use of the public courts to litigate a claim of intense 
public interest. They may not do so in secret without a specific finding of compelling interest. 
Since this has not occurred, and no other interest outweighs the public right of access, Intervenors' 


motion should be granted. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 7 of 21 


FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 


I. INTERVENORS' COVERAGE OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN AND GHISLAINE MAXWELL 


The Miami Herald is the second largest newspaper in South Florida. Established in 1903, 
it is circulated in Miami-Dade, Broward County, and Monroe County, as well as in the Caribbean 
and Latin America. Julie Brown is an investigative journalist at the Miami Herald with over twenty 
years of experience. For over three years, the Miami Herald has reported on and investigated Mr. 
Epstein and others who were involved in the sexual abuse of underage girls. Recent court filings, 
both in federal and state court, have raised new allegations about his involvement in a wider sex- 
trafficking ring. The Miami Herald has covered, among other subjects, the initial investigation by 
the Palm Beach state attorney, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office, the negotiations between 
those law enforcement agencies and Mr. Epstein's legal defense team, and the ultimate decision 
by the U.S. Attorney's Office to sign a non-prosecution agreement that was negotiated in secret 
and sealed in return for a guilty plea to a lesser state crime. The deal, which was not revealed until 
well after it was signed and Mr. Epstein was sentenced, resulted in him serving 13 months of an 
18-month sentence. He now lives in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

The Miami Herald has also reported on civil matters related to the original criminal case 
against Mr. Epstein, which include the now-settled above-captioned action. Here, the underlying 
claim is a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre ("Ms. Giuffre" or "Plaintiff") against 
Ghislaine Maxwell ("Ms. Maxwell" or "Defendant") on the grounds that Ms. Maxwell, in 
coordination with Mr. Epstein, "facilitated [] sexual abuse" of Ms. Giuffre and "wrongfully 
subjected Giuffre to public ridicule, contempt and disgrace by...calling Giuffre a liar in published 
statements." (ECF. No. 1.) Specifically, Court transcripts in the Giuffre/Maxwell case make 


several references to Ms. Maxwell being the "madame" of Mr. Epstein's sex-trafficking enterprise, 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 8 of 21 


and to witnesses who may be able to provide evidence of a wider, cross-border sex-trafficking 
ring. 

In connection with its ongoing investigation, the Miami Herald has sought to access public 
court filings that will shed light on the scope of Epstein's crimes and address serious questions 
about whether there was any undue influence that tainted the investigation. These include how the 
Epstein case was disposed of by the criminal justice system, whether victims were treated properly, 
whether Epstein's victims were unfairly kept in the dark, whether Epstein was given favorable 
treatment because of his wealth and status, in short, whether the public interest was served. These 
questions have yet to be answered because many of the records that could provide responsive 
information have been sealed. The public, including Epstein's victims, has the right to know how 
Mr. Epstein's case was prosecuted. The law provides the public with the presumption of access in 
order to hold our legal instutitions accountable and to maintain confidence that they will protect 
the most vulnerable in our society. 


Il. THE OVERBROAD SEALING ORDER AND PRIOR ATTEMPTS TO 
UNSEAL 


During litigation of the defamation claim, the Court, upon Defendant's motion, entered an 
overly broad Protective Order stating, inter alia: 


This Protective Order shall apply to all documents, materials, and 
information, including without limitation, documents produced, 
answers to interrogatories, responses to requests for admission, 
deposition testimony, and other information disclosed pursuant to 
the disclosure or discovery duties created by the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure. 

28 2K 

Information designated "CONFIDENTIAL" shall be information 
that is confidential and implicates common law and statutory 
privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Giuffre and (b) 
defendant Ghislaine Maxwell. 

2 2K 

Designation of a document as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
shall constitute a representation that such document has been 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 9 of 21 


reviewed by an attorney for the designating party, that there is a 
valid and good faith basis for such designation, made at the time of 
disclosure or production to the receiving party, and that disclosure 
of such information to persons other than those permitted access to 
such material would cause a privacy harm to the designating party. 

Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it 
shall be accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of 
the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern 
District of New York. 

28K 

A party may object to the designation of particular 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION by giving written notice to the 
party designating the disputed information. The written notice shall 
identify the information to which the objection is made. If the 
parties cannot resolve the objection within ten (10) business days 
after the time the notice is received, it shall be the obligation of the 
party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL to file an 
appropriate motion requesting that the Court determine whether the 
disputed information should be subject to the terms of this Protective 
Order. If such a motion is timely filed, the disputed information shall 
be treated as CONFIDENTIAL under the terms of this Protective 
Order until the Court rules on the motion. If the designating party 
fails to file such a motion within the prescribed time, the disputed 
information shall lose its designation as CONFIDENTIAL and shall 
not thereafter be treated as CONFIDENTIAL in accordance with 
this Protective Order. In connection with a motion filed under this 
provision, the party designating the information as 
CONFIDENTIAL shall bear the burden of establishing that good 
cause exists for the disputed information to be treated as 
CONFIDENTIAL. 


Essentially, the Protective Order allowed the Parties the autonomy to designate portions of 
the docket as "confidential" and further allowed those designated portions to remain confidential 
unless the non-designating party objected. 

Following the Protective Order, Defendant designated her deposition as confidential and 
submitted at least 13 letter motions to file documents under seal, including exhibits to discovery 
motions (see, e.g., ECF. No. 167), and discovery motions themselves. (See, e.g., ECF No. 236.) 


Each of the letter motions was so-ordered. Plaintiff also submitted at least 22 motions to file 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 10 of 21 


documents under seal, including additional discovery motions (see, e.g., ECF No. 245), and a 
Motion for an Adverse Inference Instruction. (See ECF No. 278.) The Court so-ordered each of 
these motions. After at least 35 motions on the part of Plaintiff and Defendant, the Court issued 
an order stating that the parties were no longer required to seek court approval to designate 
confidential information: 

To reduce unnecessary filings and delay, it is hereby ordered that 

letter motions to file submissions under seal pursuant to the Court's 

Protective Order, ECF No. 62, are granted. The Protective Order is 

amended accordingly such that filing a letter motion seeking sealing 

for each submission is no longer necessary. A party wishing to 

challenge the sealing of any particular submission may do so by 

motion. 
(ECF No. 348.) 

In addition to the wholesale sealing of certain motions, the entire body of Defendant's 
motion for summary judgment — 68 pages — was redacted (see ECF No. 538) and over half of the 
order denying Defendant's motion for summary judgment was redacted. (ECF No. 8772.) 

In response to the sealing, two separate parties moved to intervene and to unseal selected 
filings. The first, Alan Dershowitz, himself implicated in the Epstein scandal, moved to intervene 
and to unseal three documents or in the alternative to modify the Protective Order (the "Dershowitz 
Motion"). (ECF No. 362.) The documents that Mr. Dershowitz targeted are currently 
unidentifiable because the Dershowitz Motion was partially redacted, and the order denying the 
motion to unseal was itself sealed. The second individual, podcast host and investigative journalist 
Michael Cernovich, moved to intervene and unseal Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment 


(the "Cernovich Motion"). (ECF No. 550.) The portion of the Cernovich motion seeking to unseal 


the Motion for Summary Judgment was also denied. 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 11 of 21 


Uf. THE ORDER DENYING THE MOTIONS TO UNSEAL 


The order on the Cernovich Motion (which, unlike that on the Dershowitz Motion, was not 
sealed) reasoned that both the sensitive nature of the material at issue and the procedural status of 
the case merited closure. Regarding the former reason, the Court stated that "privacy interests of 
both parties and third parties warrant disclosure with respect to discovery materials." (ECF No. 
892, at 8.) Regarding the latter reason, the Court emphasized that, due to the ongoing status of the 
litigation and the imminence of trial, "a release of contested confidential discovery material could 
conceivably taint the jury pool." (/d., at 7.) Summarizing, the court stated: "Because of the 
sensitive nature of the materials designated as confidential, involving allegations of sexual abuse 
and trafficking of minors, and because we are mere weeks from assembling a jury for trial, the 
importance of leaving these materials protected by the Protective Order outweighs any public 
interest in their publication." (/d., at 9.) 

Messrs. Dershowitz and Cernovich both appealed to the Second Circuit. (ECF Nos. 500 
and 915.) TheaAppeals are currently pending. 

On May 24, 2016, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a settlement agreement. Now, the 
Miami Herald seeks to unseal all sealed documents on the docket, including the Parties' depositions 
and documents submitted in support of motions, and to remove any redactions from filed 
documents unless there remains a compelling need for closure. 

ARGUMENT 

As a representative of the public interest in the transparency of our courts, the Miami 
Herald seeks to intervene in this matter to unseal documents germane to a subject of intense media 
coverage and public import. Despite the sensitive nature of some of the materials under seal, the 
law affords the presumption of openness, under the common law and the First Amendment to the 


U.S. Constitution, more weight. Even if the Parties have reasons compelling enough to overcome 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 12 of 21 


this presumption, the Parties were not required, as they should have been, to articulate those 
reasons. Instead, the Parties benefited from a presumption of closure. 

Of particular importance, a main reason denying the prior motions to unseal — the on-going 
status of the litigation — is no longer relevant because the litigation has been settled. While certain 
redactions may remain necessary to shield personal medical information or the identities of crime 
victims, the majority of the materials sought here can and should be disclosed. For these reasons, 
explained in further detail below, the Miami Herald respectfully requests that the Court unseal all 
sealed files on the docket, and remove any redactions from partially redacted documents. 


L THE MIAMI HERALD HAS THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE AS A NEWS 
ORGANIZATION 


Under the law of this Circuit, news organizations are routinely permitted to intervene and 
be heard on issues involving public access to proceedings and documents, including challenges to 
discovery protective orders, pursuant to Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, either as 
a matter of right or permissively. See, e.g., Sec. and Exch. Comm'n v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 
222, 227 n.4 (2d Cir. 2001); Schiller v. City of New York, No. 04 CIV. 7921(KMK)(JC), 2006 WL 
2788256, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2006); In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 164 
F.R.D. 346, 350-51 (S.D.N.Y. 1996); Savitt v. Vacco, No. 95-CV-1842(RSP/DRH), 1996 WL 
663888, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, 1996) ("The Second Circuit Court of Appeals and its district 
courts have consistently held that news agencies have standing to challenge protective orders in 
cases of public interest."). Accordingly, this Court should permit Intervenors to intervene for the 
limited purpose of advocating for public access to these proceedings. 

This motion is timely. Intervention has been granted years into litigation - and even long 
after a case has concluded. See In re Pineapple Antitrust Litig., No. 04 MD. 1628 RMB MHD, 


2015 WL 5439090, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2015) ("There is no legal authority of which we are 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 13 of 21 


aware ... to the effect that there is a deadline by which such a journalistic request for access to 
documents must be asserted, and certainly no requirement that the application be made before the 
lawsuit is closed."); Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n v. Nat'l Children's Ctr., Inc., 146 F.3d 1042, 
1047 (D.C. Cir. 1998) ("Intervention to challenge confidentiality orders may take place long after 
a case has been terminated.") (quoting Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 779 (3d Cir. 
1994)); see also Wilson v. Am. Motors Corp., 759 F.2d 1568 (11th Cir. 1985) (non-party permitted 
to intervene after judicially approved settlement in order to challenge a seal on court documents); 
FDIC v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 230, 231-32 (2d Cir. 1982) (non-party permitted to intervene and 
challenge a stipulated confidentiality order two years after a judicially approved settlement). The 
public and the Miami Herald are entitled to access these records and proceedings at any time. 


Il. THE PRESUMPTION OF OPENNESS UNDER THE COMMON LAW AND 
FIRST AMENDMENT APPLY TO THE DOCUMENTS AT ISSUE 


A. The First Amendment and Common Law Provide For a Presumption of 
Access to Judicial Documents 


The public holds an affirmative, enforceable right of access to judicial records under both 
the common law and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 
273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (noting that the common law and First Amendment 
provide "related but distinct presumptions in favor of public access to court ... records") (quoting 
Newsday LLC v. Cnty. Of Nassau, 730 F.3d 156, 163 (2d Cir. 2013)). Both regimes protect the 
values of transparency and accountability in the judicial process through procedural requirements, 
and both place heavy burdens on parties seeking to seal judicial records to ensure that the courts 
do not sacrifice the public's right of access to the desires of the litigations. See generally Lugosch 
v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006) (First Amendment and common law 
right to judicial documents); Jn re Omnicom Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 02 CIV. 4483 RCC/MHD, 


2006 WL 3016311, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2006) (an application to seal "must address and 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 14 of 21 


overcome the presumption of public filing that finds its twin sources in the common-law right of 
public access to judicial documents and the qualified First Amendment right to attend judicial 
proceedings. The two are entirely complementary."). 

Historically, at common law, "both civil and criminal trials have been presumptively open." 
E*Trade Fin. Corp. v. Deutsche Bank AG, 582 F. Supp. 2d 528, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (citing 
Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580 n.17 (1980)). Recently, the Second Circuit 
reiterated the common law presumption in Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann 
LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 142 (2d Cir. 2016). In Bernstein, the Second Circuit emphasized the "general 
right to inspect and copy...judicial records and documents." Jd. at 142 (quoting Nixon v. Warner 
Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978)). It further explained that the weight of the presumption 
is a function of: "(1) the role of the material at issue in the exercise of Article III judicial power 
and (2) the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal courts, balanced 
against competing considerations such as 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure."" Jd. 
(internal quotation marks omitted). The presumption weakens where "testimony or documents 
play only a negligible role in the performance of Article II duties," but even so, there remains a 
"prediction of public access." Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d at 121. Moreover, 
even if a court determines that the interests of those seeking closure outweigh the presumption of 
access, "sealing must be supported by specific findings." Hardy v. Kaszycki & Sons, No. 83-CV- 
6346 (LAP), 2017 WL 6805707, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2017) (citing United States v. Amodeo, 
44 F.3d 141, 148 (2d Cir. 1995)); see also Bernstein v. O'Reilly, Case No. 17-cv-9483 (S.D.N.Y. 
April 3, 2018) (denying motion to seal where defendant failed to "present compelling 


countervailing factors that could overcome the presumption of public access" to court records.). 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 15 of 21 


The First Amendment presumption of access is even stronger. As the U.S. Supreme Court 
has said time and again, the First Amendment requires open courts and court records to ensure the 
"appearance of fairness [that is] so essential to public confidence in the system." Press-Enterprise 
Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 508 (1984). The media's access to judicial proceedings and 
records keeps the public informed and helps instill public confidence in both the process and the 
results of trials. Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 559-60 (1976); Nixon, 435 U.S. at 
609. "The press does not simply publish information about trials but guards against the miscarriage 
of justice by subjecting the police, prosecutors, and judicial processes to extensive public scrutiny 
and criticism." Landmark Commc'ns, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 838-39 (1978). 

The First Amendment access right imposes a heavy burden on those who seek to limit 
public access to justify the restriction. See Globe Newspapers, Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 
596, 606 (1982) ("the State's justification in denying access must be a weighty one"); Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co., 435 F.3d 110 at 126 (First Amendment "gives rise to a higher burden on the party 
seeking to prevent disclosure than does the common law presumption"); In re Methyl Tertiary 
Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., MDL No. 1358, 2013 WL 3531600, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 
12, 2013) ("Once properly invoked, the public's right of access to judicial documents under the 
First Amendment must be given strong weight.") (internal quotation marks omitted). As the 
Supreme Court explained in Globe Newspapers, the standard to be met is a strict one: "Where .. . 
the State attempts to deny the right of access in order to inhibit the disclosure of sensitive 
information, it must be shown that the denial is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest, 
and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest." 457 U.S. at 606-07 (1982). 

In this case, the Protective Order improperly reversed the common law and First 


Amendment presumption of openness to one of closure. Instead of requiring the Parties to 


10 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 16 of 21 


demonstrate a compelling need for closure, the Protective Order effectively rubber-stamped any 
information designated as confidential by the Parties. The Court then reaffirmed the presumption 
of closure by lifting the requirement in the original Protective Order that required the parties to 
submit letter motions in order to seal documents. (ECF No. 348.) Though the original Protective 
Order provided the non-designating party with a mechanism to dispute a confidentiality 
designation (ECF No. 62, {/ 11), this did not, and cannot, replace the public's baseline right to 
access. 


B. The Documents at Issue Qualify As Judicial Documents 


All of the documents that the Miami Herald seeks to unseal — in whole or in part — qualify 
as "judicial documents" to which applies the common law and First Amendment presumption of 
access. Recently, this court noted that "[g]lenerally, the presumption of access applies to all 
documents filed with the court." Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d at 269; see also United States v. 
Sattar, 471 F. Supp. 2d 380, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (generally, a document is a "judicial document" 
if itis "submitted to the Court for the purposes of seeking or opposing adjudication."); Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006) (a judicial document is one that is 
"relevant to performance of judicial function and useful in judicial process"). Defendant's motion 
for summary judgment fits this definition squarely because it presents the substantive reasons for 
final adjudication. See Bernstein, 814 F.3d at 136 (holding that motions for summary judgments, 
as well as reports submitted in connection with a motion for summary judgment, are entitled a 


strong presumption of access). 


11 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 17 of 21 


The remaining documents, the majority of which are those submitted in opposition or 
support to discovery motions, also qualify.! Citing the broad rule in Lugosch, the court in 
Alexander Interactive, Inc. v. Adorama, Inc., No. 12 CIV. 6608 PKC JCF, 2014 WL 4346174, at 
*2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2014), stated that "documents to be submitted are in support of a motion to 
compel discovery [] presumably will be necessary to or helpful in resolving that motion. They are, 
therefore, judicial documents." Similarly, in Jn re Omnicom Grp., the court held that a "series of 
letter briefs with accompanying exhibits...certainly qualify as judicial documents." 2006 WL 
3016311 at *2. These briefs were submitted, "to request the court to exercise its adjudicative 
powers in favor of the parties’ respective views of a discovery dispute." /d.; see also Schiller, 2006 
WL 2788256, at *5 (holding that briefs and supporting papers submitted in connection with a 
dispute over the confidentiality of discovery materials were "created by or at the behest of counsel 
and presented to a court in order to sway a judicial decision" and were therefore "judicial 
documents that trigger the presumption of public access"). The docket entries and accompanying 
exhibits, including deposition testimony, sealed by the following orders are therefore "judicial 
documents": ECF Nos. 100, 145, 158, 163, 167, 183, 186, 196, 344 (entries related to motions to 
compel); ECF Nos. 168, 178, 197, 209, 236, 256, 273, 285, 319, 249 (entries related to motions to 
serve deposition subpoenas, exceed deposition limits, reopen Plaintiff's deposition, or complete 
depositions); ECF Nos. 266, 282, 285, 297, 328, 350 (entries related to motion for adverse 
inference); ECF Nos. 125, 329 (entries related to motions concerning forensic examination of 
computer); ECF No. 146 (entries related to brief in support of privilege claimed for Plaintiff's in 


camera submission); ECF no. 354, 275 (entries related to Defendant's response to non-party's 


' The Miami Herald is only able to identify the nature of the sealed documents that were filed before the Court 
issued its order (ECF. No. 348), which lifted the requirement that the Parties file a letter motion in order to designate 
information as confidential and seal. 


12 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 18 of 21 


motion to quash subpoena); ECF No. 281, 286 (entries related to Plaintiff's sur-reply); ECF No. 
322 (entries related to Plaintiff's proposed search terms); ECF. No. 332 (entries related to exhibit 
accompanying Plaintiff's notice of supplemental authority); ECF. 351 (entries related to motion 
for protective order). 

I. THE DOCKET SHOULD BE UNSEALED BECAUSE THERE ARE NO 


COMPELLING CIRCUMSTANCES IN THIS CASE THAT OVERCOME 
THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT OF ACCESS 


In light of the First Amendment and common law presumption against closure and the First 
Amendment's stringent, "compelling reason" standard, the interests of the Parties are insufficient 
when weighed against the public's right of access. 

As a preliminary matter, one of the main reasons for closure identified in the Court's denial 
of the Cernovich Motion — the ongoing status of the litigation — is no longer relevant because the 
case has settled. Accordingly there is no more risk that the "release of contested confidential 
discovery materials could conceivably taint the jury pool." (ECF No. 892, at 7.) Any weight given 
to the fact that, at the time of the denial of the Cernovich motion, the case was "mere weeks from 
assembling" trial, should be disregarded. The legal rights of the parties are now settled, and if the 
public's interest in this matter was at all tempered in light of the on-going litigation, it is now 
renewed. 

Further, even if the case remained open, the privacy interests of the litigants do not 
outweigh the public's right of access under the First Amendment. Ms. Giuffre's allegations have 
been the subject of significant public interest and have been covered at length by the Miami Herald 
and other members of the news media. Coverage is ongoing, and there are several aspects of the 
story that require further investigation. As such, the judicial documents in question involve issues 
that are "manifestly ones of public concern and therefore ones in which the public has an interest 


in overseeing." United States v. Erie Cnty., 763 F.3d 235, 242 (2d Cir. 2014); see also Under Seal 


13 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 19 of 21 


273 F. Supp. 3d at 472 (unsealing entire docket and holding that public right of access outweighed 
defendant's concern of adverse publicity and her reliance on previously executed confidentiality 
agreement); Bernstein, 814 F.3d at 143-44 (attempt to seal complaint against law firm alleging that 
partners engaged in kick-back scheme was properly denied where complaint was of "legitimate 
interest to the public" and where disclosure would not reveal details of an ongoing investigation, 
pose a risk to witnesses, endanger national security, reveal trade secrets, or implicate duty to 
protect attorney-client material or confidential client information); Hardy, 2017 WL 6805707, at 
*6-7 (unsealing transcript of settlkement between workers' union and, inter alia, the Trump 
Organization and holding that, under common law and the First Amendment, public interest 
outweighed reliance on sealing order and the "generalized interest" in promoting settlement). 
Neither of the Parties have presented the "specific, on-the-record findings" that establish a 
compelling reason for sealing or redaction. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 126. Quite the opposite — the 
Court initially granted at least 35 letter motions to seal documents, the vast majority with de 
minimis justification. See, e.g. ECF No. 285 (So-ordering sealing where Defendant reasoned 
"Exhibits contain content designated as confidential by the parties pursuant to the Protective 
Order"); ECF No. 236 (So-ordering the sealing where Defendant reasoned "These Motions, 
Declarations, and Exhibits contain content designated as confidential by the parties pursuant to the 
protective order"). The Court then lifted any requirement for justification whatsoever when it 
ceased to require letter motions prior to sealing. In sum, the parties did not — and were not required 
to — rebut the presumption of access afforded by the common law and the First Amendment, much 


less establish the prerequisite "compelling interest" needed to justify sealing.

IV. THE PARTIES HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED GOOD CAUSE FOR SEALING 
NON-JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS, IF ANY 


Even if the Court were to hold that the documents at issue are not "judicial documents" 
the Parties have not met the "good cause" standard that is still required to justify closure of other 
documents. "[T]he party seeking a protective order has the burden of showing that good cause 
exists for issuance of that order. However, it is equally apparent that the obverse also is true, i.e., 
if good cause is not shown, the discovery materials in question should not receive judicial 
protection and therefore would be open to the public for inspection." Gambale v. Deutsche Bank, 
377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted); Mitchell v. Fishbein, 
227 F.R.D. 239, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (movant must demonstrate good cause for order barring 
public dissemination of discovery materials); Condit v. Dunne, 225 F.R.D. 113, 115 (S.D.N.Y. 
2004) (same). 

To show good cause under Rule 26(c), parties must demonstrate that disclosure will cause 
a clear and serious injury via a "particular and specific demonstration of fact, as distinguished from 
stereotyped and conclusory statements." Havens v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., No. 94 CIV. 
1402 (CSH), 1995 WL 234710, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. April 20, 1995) (quoting Cipollone v. Liggett 
Grp., Inc., 785 F.2d 1108, 1121 (3d Cir. 1986)); see also Carlson v. Geneva City Sch. Dist., 277 
F.R.D. 90, 94 (W.D.N.Y. 2011) (requiring "defined, specific, and serious injury") (citation 
omitted); Allen v. City of New York, 420 F. Supp. 2d 295, 302 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (to establish good 
cause, a party must demonstrate that "a clearly defined and serious injury ... would result from 
disclosure of the document." (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)); Jn re Terrorist 
Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 454 F. Supp. 2d 220, 222 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (ordinarily good cause 
demonstrated "when a party shows that disclosure will result in a clearly defined, specific and 


serious injury") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In this case, the blanket 


15 


Case 1:15-cv-07433-RWS Document 936 Filed 04/06/18 Page 21 of 21 


Protective Order allows the Parties to seal presumptively public information merely by 
designation, without any judicial scrutiny at all, and therefore the good cause standard is not 
satisfied. 


CONCLUSION 


For the foregoing reasons, the Miami Herald's motion to intervene and unseal all sealed 


or redacted docket entries should be granted.
