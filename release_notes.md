# Release Notes

## 15.4.2 - 2026-03-04 - Timeline Accuracy & Evidence Backing

### Timeline & API

- **Evidence-Backed Timeline:** The Timeline API (`GET /api/timeline`) now returns comprehensive evidence counts for each event, including document, media, and supporting evidence totals.
- **Deduplication:** Improved event grouping logic to merge duplicate timeline entries (e.g., "Epstein Court Documents Released") into single canonical milestones, preventing clutter.
- **Date Filtering:** Added `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters to the timeline feed for precise historical filtering.

### Data Integrity

- **Canonical Milestones:** Established deterministic deduplication keys for major historical events (e.g., Epstein's death, 2024 document releases, bank settlements) to ensure a clean, authoritative chronology.
- **Inference Classifier Fix:** Resolved a regression where real individuals with professional roles (e.g., "Lawyer") were incorrectly classified as inferred entities.
- **Real-Person Priority:** Enforced strict sorting precedence (`RFI -> Risk -> Mentions`) to ensure named individuals always rank above inferred or role-based entities in search results.

### User Experience

- **Rate Limit Stabilization:** Fixed `429 Too Many Requests` errors for public users by implementing proxy-aware rate limiting (`trust proxy`) and increasing the global per-IP allowance.
- **Profile Avatars:** Restored profile photos for entities by implementing a smarter fallback lookup that checks for album matches when direct media links are missing.

## 15.3.0 - 2026-03-04 - Subject Integrity & Performance

### Core Improvements

- **Subject Aggregation:** Hardened the subject card system to correctly merge stats from all alias variants (e.g., "Donald Trump" + "President Trump"), preventing undercounting of mentions.
- **Startup Reliability:** Added automatic fallback to `/api/subjects` if the primary entities endpoint fails, ensuring the application always boots successfully even during partial outages.
- **Media Access:** Opened media endpoints (`/api/media/*`) for public read access, allowing researchers to browse albums and tags without authentication.

### Bug Fixes

- **Stale Bundle Reload:** The client now automatically detects new deployments and reloads the page to prevent "ChunkLoadError" crashes for users with long-running tabs.
- **Public Validation:** Fixed validation logic to allow `limit=500` on public document queries, matching the behavior of the active client.

## 15.0.0 - 2026-03-02 - Production Hardening & PostgreSQL Migration

### Major Architecture Update

- **PostgreSQL Migration:** Completed the transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL 16+, enabling massive concurrency and improved data integrity for the 1.3M document corpus.
- **Database Hardening:** Implemented strict connection pooling, robust health checks (`/api/health/deep`), and automated schema verification to prevent drift.
- **Legacy Cleanup:** Removed all dependencies on `better-sqlite3` and purged legacy SQLite database files from production.

### Security & Access

- **Strict RBAC:** Enforced Role-Based Access Control on all sensitive endpoints. Public users can access health and auth routes, while investigative data requires appropriate permissions.
- **Case Export:** Added a secure `GET /api/investigations/:id/export/zip` endpoint for researchers to download comprehensive case bundles (evidence + metadata).

## 14.5.0 - 2026-02-24 - Forensic Analytics & Network Intelligence

### Interactive Intelligence

- **Global Entity Map:** Launched a high-performance geospatial map visualizing 130k+ entity locations with risk-based clustering.
- **Network Graph V2:** Introduced "Semantic Zoom" and "VIP Face Integration" to the network graph, revealing deeper connections and high-risk figures at a glance.
- **Signal Purification:** Deployed advanced heuristics to filter out OCR noise and low-signal artifacts, ensuring cleaner search results and analytics.

### Data Recovery

- **Dataset Restoration:** Restored missing datasets for "Black Book" entries, "Palm Beach Properties," and "Flight Logs" via idempotent PostgreSQL migrations.
- **Email Metadata:** Backfilled missing sender/recipient metadata for thousands of emails by parsing raw `.eml` files, enabling accurate "Person-Only" mailbox filtering.

## 14.0.0 - 2026-02-19 - Temporal Investigation & Forensic Determinism

### Investigative Tools

- **Temporal Graph Filtering:** Added a global timeline slider to the Analytics dashboard, allowing investigators to slice the network graph by specific time periods.
- **Provenance Tracking:** The Evidence Drawer now displays full extraction metadata (AI model, pipeline version), providing complete traceability for every claim.
- **Visual Evidence Encoding:** Differentiated graph edges to show "Direct" (evidence-backed) vs. "Inferred" (agentic) connections.

### UI Polish

- **Liquid Glass Design:** Refreshed the entire UI with a modern "liquid glass" aesthetic, improved depth, and consistent high-contrast accessibility tokens.
- **Unified Navigation:** Reworked the global header and search bar for better usability and reduced visual clutter.

## 13.0.0 - 2026-02-11 - Forensic Transparency & Credibility

### Evidence & Audit

- **Evidence Ladder:** Launched a verified evidence system where every "Direct" claim is backed by at least one specific document span.
- **Agentic Watermarking:** All AI-assisted inferences are now explicitly marked (`was_agentic=true`) and logged for forensic audit.
- **Integrity Suite:** Deployed a new `credibility_tests` suite to continuously verify graph invariants and confidence consistency.

### Operations

- **Deep Health Checks:** Enhanced monitoring to track FTS synchronization, database journal health, and critical table statistics.
- **Automated Backups:** Implemented zero-downtime backups with daily restore drills to guarantee data preservation.

## 12.0.0 - 2026-02-02 - DOJ Archive Consolidation

### Archive Expansion

- **Massive Ingestion:** Integrated DOJ datasets 10, 11, and 12, adding tens of thousands of pages of previously fragmented evidence.
- **Unified Discovery:** Standardized the organizational structure for all DOJ materials to enable seamless cross-referencing.

### Forensic Workspace

- **Financial Transaction Mapper:** Visualizes financial flows between entities to highlight potential money laundering or high-risk transfers.
- **Multi-Source Correlation:** Cross-references entity mentions across the entire archive to surface hidden connections and verify facts.

## 11.0.0 - 2026-01-20 - Data Expansion & Analytics Upgrade

### Flight Logs & Properties

- **Flight Log Expansion:** Expanded the flight database to 110 documented flights (1995-2005) and added support for the "N212JE" Gulfstream II aircraft.
- **Palm Beach Properties:** Ingested 9,535 property records, automatically flagging those owned by known Epstein associates.

### Media & Search

- **Audio Intelligence:** Added transcript-derived titles and smart albums for audio evidence (e.g., "Sascha Barros Interviews").
- **Full Text Search:** Restored high-performance FTS with term highlighting (`<mark>`) in document results.

## 10.0.0 - 2026-01-13 - Media Unification & Audio Intelligence

### Unified Media Experience

- **Media Browser:** Unified Audio, Video, and Image browsing into a consistent interface with batch tagging and filtering.
- **Smart Metadata:** Automatically generates titles and descriptions for audio files based on their transcripts.

### Bug Fixes

- **Modal Stacking:** Resolved critical z-index issues where document viewers would open behind entity modals.
- **Junk Filtering:** Aggressively removed thousands of OCR noise entities (e.g., "Total Cash Disbursements") to improve index quality.
