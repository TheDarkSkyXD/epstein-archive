The final trading day of the week is also the busiest for economic numbers, with two key reports out at 8:30 a.m. ET. Retail sales are expected to post a 0.5-percent gain for July after a 0.6-percent advance in June, while the Producer Price Index is seen rising 0.1 percent for July after June's 0.5-percent jump. At 10 a.m. ET, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index should come in at 92.0 for the August preliminary reading, according to consensus forecasts, two points higher than the final July number. At the same time, the government is out with June business inventories, expected to be up 0.1 percent after a 0.1-percent gain in May. J.C. Penney (JCP) is among the few companies out with quarterly earnings this morning, following a string of upbeat retail reports Thursday.
 There are no reports of note out after today's closing bell. 
STOCKS TO WATCH

Nordstrom (JWN) reported quarterly profit of 67 cents per share, 11 cents above estimates. Revenue was essentially in line with forecasts. Nordstrom also raised its 2016 earnings guidance above current Street consensus. Planet Fitness (PLNT) earned an adjusted 17 cents per share for the second quarter, 2 cents above estimates. Revenue for the fitness chain was well above Street consensus. The bottom line was helped by substantial growth for same-location sales, and the company also raised its annual guidance. Nvidia (NVDA) came in 3 cents above estimates with quarterly profit of 40 cents per share, while revenue for the graphics chipmaker was also above estimates. Nvidia's sales growth was its best in almost five years, with good demand in its gaming business. General Motors (GM) is
 seeking a new court hearing over $10 billion in liabilities involving faulty ignition switches. The automaker contends that the court made two fundamental errors when it rejected GM's attempt to use its 2009 bankruptcy as a way to shield itself from litigation. Silicon Graphics (SGI) will be bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) for $275 million or $7.75 per share. That represents a 30-percent premium for shareholders in the maker of server, storage and software products.
