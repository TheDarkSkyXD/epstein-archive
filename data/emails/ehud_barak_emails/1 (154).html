amended to the form of payment section to provide that payments on the

 is is Ergo Ltd., which is solely owned by EB and will be the general 
partner of the LLP that will invest in Reporty.&nbsp; Once the LLP is formed,
 the note will be Automatically assigned to the LLP and the LLP will 
become the Borrower ).&nbsp; So, it gives EB’s company discretion to pay us

comment, I note that they have asked you to rely upon EB’s promise to 
form the LLP, and to rely upon EB’s promise to restructure this 
transaction once the LLP is formed.&nbsp; They also want you to rely on the 
promise that the Reporty shares will be the security for this loan, but 
not to require a pledge in respect of this security.&nbsp; At the same time 
that they are asking that you rely upon EB’s promises, they are 
insisting that your company, which has already funded $1MM to a newly 
formed entity without any signed documentation, to provide a document 
obligating itself to fund the additional $500k "within 10 days from the 
receipt of a notice from the GP of the LLP that the milestone was 
achieved.” &nbsp;Shouldn’t the same trust work both ways here?&nbsp; Second, the
