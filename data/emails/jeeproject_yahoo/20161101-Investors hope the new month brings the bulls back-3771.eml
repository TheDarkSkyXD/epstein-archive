Both were up about 6 percent for the year. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square was down 3 percent through Oct. 25, and off more than 21 percent for the year.The October ISM manufacturing index is the biggest economic report of the day, out at the 10 a.m. ET. At the same time, the government releases its construction spending report for September.October U.S. vehicle sales roll in throughout the day, with one exception: due to a fire at its headquarters, Ford (F) won't release its numbers today, but hopes to do so later this week.
In addition to this morning's earnings reports, Electronic Arts (EA), Papa John's (PZZA), US Steel (X), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), Western Union (WU) and Zillow (ZG) issue quarterly results after the bell this afternoon.

STOCKS TO WATCH

BP (BP) reported net profit for the third quarter of $1.62 billion, trouncing the consensus expectation of $686 million, but still only delivering around half of last year's result for the period. Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) issued better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter, but gave a cautious outlook, as the oil giant continues to struggle in an environment of low oil prices.
Anadarko Petroleum (APC) lost 89 cents per share, wider than the 57-cent loss forecast by analysts. Revenue was also below estimates, on the continuing weakness in energy prices.
L Brands (LB) said October comparable store sales are expected to be up 1 percent. The apparel maker also said third quarter earnings would come in at the low end of estimates.
Tenet Healthcare (THC) reported quarterly profit of 16 cents per share, missing estimates by 3 cents and lowered its full-year revenue and profit forecasts. Quarterly revenue did beat expectations.
