on sustaining and enhancing its effectiveness as it adds more employees, cu=

<span style=3D"font-size: 13px;">Game theory is the mathematical modeling o=
f strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what=
 we call "games" in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it=
 includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, comp=
etition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How =
could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer-to-peer fi=
le-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people us=
ing them?</span><strong>&nbsp; <a href=3D"http://click.icptrack.com/icp/rel=
