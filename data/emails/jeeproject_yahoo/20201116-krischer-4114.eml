I was sorry not to have you present at the meeting I had with Dahlia , lann=
a and=C2=A0 detective Recarey. I was told you had a last minute emergency, =
and hope the outcome of your meeting was more satisfactory than mine..HAd y=
ou been there , I beleive you would now concur in my strong belief that cha=
rges, against Jeffrey Epstein should not be brought.=C2=A0 ...I thought it =
appropriate to give you at least my version of=C2=A0 what transpired at the=
=C2=A0 meeting=C2=A0 so as to make our=C2=A0 scheduled meeting on thursday =
the 23, more productive.=C2=A0 IN a kafkaesque scenario, I find myself tryi=
ng to at the prosecutions request,to=C2=A0 give evidence in an attempt to=
=C2=A0 rebut charges, and allegations of specific "incidents" of wrongdoing=
, while at the same time the prosecutors are totally unwilling to detail th=
ose allegations.. astonishingly, We have been still=C2=A0 unable to obtain,=
 from them=C2=A0 the details of charges ,the names , place s, time and even=
ts under investigation, but are told " if you give us the evidence we will =
consider it....Lanna confirmed that she you and dahlia, and considered a fa=
ir resolution, but you had decided that due to recarey's , discontent, to s=
end the case to a grand jury. As I had, responded to you on the phone, I tr=
ust your experience, balanced, mature view, of the overall circumstances , =
far more than I would a Grand jury..=C2=A0 As , they would simply see , a y=
oung woman , who suggests wrongdoing, look at the statute, and have little =
choice but to indict. The woman traditionally is obvioulsy not=C2=A0 subjec=
t to even the slightest cross examination, and her history , lack of credib=
ility, and in some cases, arrest, drug use, and in the=C2=A0 specific case =
of Alexandra Hall ,what we understand to be the main witness,=C2=A0 . confe=
ssed incidents of theft.were not even brought to the prosecutors attention =
, nevermind the grand jurys'.TO remind you this girl was arrested for marij=
uana posession in september , did community service, in october, and immedi=
atly upon completion was fell back into her well established pattern of bre=
aking the law.SEperate from her admitted drug use and web pages that we hav=
e previouly forwarded to you, we have in our posesions her e- mails where s=
he referrs to her " illigimate occupation". I've attached the incident repo=
rt that we gave to Lanna , clearly illustrating these facts.=C2=A0 I did th=
is however after, much trepidation, over providing to your office, evidence=
 that is=C2=A0 one of our most sensitive documents , clearly=C2=A0 that wou=
ld be used to totally destroy MS Halls credibility at the unlikely event of=
 a trial.=C2=A0 THis was provided as well as a charge slip that confirms th=
at when ms Hall bought the strap on dildo, from her favorite sex shop. she =
had obvioulsy been above the age of eighteen.... I don't want to appear fli=
ppant where such an important matter is at stake, but IF I were detective r=
ecarey, and had bought into=C2=A0 what is=C2=A0 now the obvious lies of mis=
s hall, and understood yiddish, when I saw the proof that we had been refer=
ring to, I would "plotz". ...=C2=A0 I spent some time at the meeting, reite=
rating my view, that I know that you share, that in instances of age relate=
d offenses, that both the responsibility and the precedent of your office i=
s to excercise discretion with both breadth and justice.. I referred to the=
 Supreme court of Wisconsin case where judge abrahamson made the relevant o=
bservation,=C2=A0 In strict liability offenses, perhaps=C2=A0 ...insert----=
...In this case, unlike the Harley case that you agreed, was not the case t=
o which you had referred, Lanna still thought there was a connection betwee=
n Harleys forty years that began with strong arm rape, shooting into an occ=
upied building, stolen merchandise=C2=A0 etc. with Mr Epsteins history of p=
hilanthropy on a rarely found scale. medicine , israel. science, education,=
 the arts, as well as participation in world bodies, including the Trilater=
al COmmision , and the council on foreign affairs..=C2=A0 IF there was ever=
 a poster boy example for the excercise of prosecutorial discretion. this i=
s it.Alexandra hall had told others that she was determined to be really re=
ally rich and would do absolutly anything , to accomplish that goal... Her =
offering anal sex, or stealing the magazine detailing Mr Epstein's accompli=
shmnets, wer simply steps she saw as part of her plan..SHe was turned down =
when she wanted to ride on his plane,( our guess, and only a guess, why Rec=
arey as late as last week . appraochd Mr Epstein's pilot and told him quite=
 unncessarily that he had been investigatin MR Epstein since 2004 and had a=
sked informed him for the first time that there was an investigation regard=
ing fourteen year old girls..=C2=A0 It would have saved a great deal of tim=
e and trouble for both my client and your office had the detective taken ev=
en the simple step of checking to see if Alexandra had a juvnile record... =
we did , she did , and we informed recarey at the meeting....... AS you hav=
e acknwoledged, we have been as cooperative as possible, but I must admit u=
ntil today it's been quite a one way street, as the prosecutors, still refu=
se to even tell us the names of their supossed witnesses... IF they were in=
 fact in Mr Epstein's house, he obviously must know them,, so why not tell =
him who they are.. AT our first meeting you had specifically told me that y=
ou would never bring a touching, case,,, but when I ask if there is more th=
an that, I'm met with "Im sorry there is an ongoing investigation,=C2=A0 an=
d if you like to refute the secret facts please do as soon s possible.. Thi=
s is obviously not fair.. Lanna responded to this concern with the statment=
 , that this is always how it is with Grand Juries.. however, as you will c=
ertanily agree, as we can't find any precedent in your office for a case wh=
ere a man if all your=C2=A0 alleged facts are to be believed, is in no posi=
tion other than the recent massage parlor visitor, who=C2=A0 in one instanc=
e said he had visited the establishment over two hundred times.and was neve=
r prosecuted..=C2=A0 With regard precedent, we have still not been able to =
find a similar case, including the one to which you referred taht began as =
an elderly abuse case.. In fact guy Fronsteins' has had someone at the cour=
thouse researching for two weeks, as well as my researchers for considerabl=
y longer, and neither of us, have found a similar case.. There is no allega=
tion regarding a person in position of authority, no coercion, no drugs , a=
lcohol , or agression of any kind.=C2=A0 In fact it is readily acknowledged=
 that the girls were knowingly coming to Palm Beach to give a topless massa=
ge.=C2=A0 It would be a setting a new precedent without=C2=A0 comparision t=
o charge a person in this circumstance..=C2=A0 Dahlia had said that the agg=
ravting circumstance in this case ws " volume..."=C2=A0 I responded that in=
 fact=C2=A0 if touching was not of interest to the office,(I recall the sto=
ry of the fifteen year old stripper, that you said would never cause a pros=
ecution) then in fact "volume" was the best example that my client did noth=
ing more... As I'm sure you were told only a very few number of girls that =
may have=C2=A0 slipped through his precations, have alleged anything more s=
erious... This is not the pattern of Mr Harley , who would never pass up th=
e opportunity to video tape his victims without their knowldge,=C2=A0 then =
attempt to sell the tapes, and had a clear understanding thatthe girls=C2=
=A0 were being m paid for sex, and his only possible defense was I'm sorry =
but that man=C2=A0 , naked on the video tape in my bed who shares my body=
=C2=A0 is not really me...=C2=A0 ... The last half hour of the meeting seem=
d to be more constructive an began=C2=A0 moving toward a resolution .. Lann=
a had initially said that she and Dahlia had considered=C2=A0 a plea to thr=
ee misdemeanor charges of "contributing to the deliquency of a minor", , I =
was adamant that we could not agree to that charge, as not only would it be=
=C2=A0 grossly unfair but a public=C2=A0 sex charge would not only damamge =
my client , but would harm innocent third parties, who would no longer be a=
ble to accept his well established charity... She then=C2=A0 suggested some=
thing she referred to as pre trial intervention...=C2=A0 I was unfamiliar w=
ith the concept.. but she thought this=C2=A0 idea might lead to a possible =
solution.. I suggested that the charge would have to be=C2=A0 be a non sex =
related=C2=A0 charge as=C2=A0 I think we agreed that a=C2=A0 sex charge=C2=
=A0 didn't add anything to the pound of flesh that your office appears=C2=
=A0 to be focused on receiving.(simple battery) I said that I=C2=A0 thought=
 that an unfair but expeditious resolution might be in my client's best int=
erest , especially in the light of the threat of the aformentioned ,=C2=A0 =
one sided grand jury proceding ,=C2=A0 and suggested we=C2=A0 might agree t=
o a deferred prosecution,=C2=A0 .. Dahlia said she thought this was=C2=A0 t=
antamount to getting=C2=A0 nothing , but I strongly disagreed, as did Guy.=
=C2=A0 As Mr. Epstein would I believe agree to=C2=A0 reasonable restriction=
s on his future behavior , without=C2=A0=20
effecting his charity. The contract, for this or a pre trial diversion, cou=

what appears to be=C2=A0 a win- win situation.=C2=A0=20
