Jeffrey and Ghislaine: Notes on New York's Oddest Alliance <http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/03/notes-on- new-yorks-oddest-couple-jeffrey-epstein-and-ghislaine- maxwell.html> by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky-ward> March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM "I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will never think the same way about anything again." So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment as the alleged "procurer" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called "The Talented Mr. Epstein." It was largely a business piece that focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery-how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned-and, in one case, flown-to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others-it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight-that I have decided to write about this myself. Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. "Do they speak?" I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. "Not like you, Vicky," was his riposte. I remembered that when we'd once discussed math-in particular, an isosceles triangle-and I revealed I hadn't HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030478 

studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a book: "Math for idiots. So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. "Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects," newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and you know this to be true. When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that "Andy"-as Jeffrey calls him-is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far more than "Andy" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. And Ghislaine? Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of-probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends. Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo- Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as "the Tennis Goddess") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she really cares about-and Ariadne is one of them-Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. "He saved her," I remember a close friend of mine telling me. "When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that-and never will." In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive "black hole" he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a normal life-whatever that is. He had a second "wife" for many years whose existence he has been open about. So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.

Chancellor Alistair Darling has sent out a warning shot to America not to go it alone with bank sector reforms, it was reported today. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Darling cautioned that President Barack Obama's war on Wall Street announced last week could harm international co-ordination. He called for unity among the G20 nations and also said the moves to curb banks would not have prevented the financial crisis. "If everyone does their own thing it will achieve absolutely nothing," said Mr Darling. He added: "The banks are global - they are quite capable of organising themselves in such a way that if the regime is difficult in one country, they will go to another one and that doesn't do anyone any good." The US president sent shockwaves through the banking sector on both sides of the Atlantic with last week's announcement of proposals to limit the activities of banks. The plans include a ban on retail banks from using their own money in investments, instead of being limited to investing their customers' funds, and restrictions on banks' abilities to make high-risk trades. Mr Obama said he was ready for a "fight" with the sector over the reforms, which came in the middle of the US bank reporting season revealing bumper profits at many major groups. The Tories were quick to back Mr Obama and accused the UK Government of becoming internationally "isolated" over the banking overhaul. However, Mr Darling today stood firm on his opposition to plans that would effectively split retail and investment banks. "You could end up dividing institutions and making them separate legal entities, but that isn't the point," he told The Sunday Times. "The point is the connectivity between them in relation to their financial transactions." He stressed that failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers did not have retail deposits, but was allowed to go to the wall with disastrous consequences for the global financial system. He said: "Equally the large-small thing doesn't run - Northern Rock was very small in global terms but systemically it was quite important when it got into trouble." The UK will continue working with the US on banking overhaul plans, but the Chancellor said he would ensure proposals did not "disadvantage London relative to the rest of the world". But the UK has so far gone out on a limb with its one-off 50% special tax on City bonuses over €25,000. The move has already seen threats from banks to relocate affected staff abroad, while a number of foreign banks - including Credit Suisse and reportedly Goldman Sachs - are capping or reducing UK staff pay. US Treasury officials are understood to be arriving in London tomorrow to brief the Government on Mr Obama's radical plans. And City minister Lord Myners is said to be gathering UK and international officials to discuss solutions to the "too big to fail" issue.

"But more often then not, the team of economic advisers was operating from different playbooks, with Summers calling his plays the loudest. Take, for instance, the debate that surrounded the Volcker rule -- the regulatory reform component that curtailed proprietary trading at U.S. banks and limited their investments in private equity firms and hedge funds. As Wolffe reports: [Summers'] doubts sat there in the West Wing, blocking the Volcker rule for months. Obama had signaled that he wanted the rule to move forward back in October. The banks were on safe ground again, but could still benefit from subsidized lending by the federal government. That seemed wrong when they could use the money to trade for themselves rather than lend it to customers in the real economy... Biden was an old friend of Volcker's and started to press for the rule to take force. But as the weeks dragged on, Summers rehashed his same old questions and concerns. At one fall meeting with his economics team in the Oval Office, Obama wanted to know why nothing had moved yet. Summers dug in once again, while Geithner - whose media coverage cast him as a supposed ally of Wall Street - wanted to push ahead. Obama noted dryly, "I think I can argue everyone's position now.

From: Sent: To: Jeffrey Epstein [jeevacation@gmail.com] 3/8/2011 1:48:24 AM Darren Indyke Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily Mail uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den. Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the 58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex oftences. Ghislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is named in several messages. In one left for her or 'Sarah', a caller says she 'doesn't know at what time she must come this night for the massage'. Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: 'She has females for Mr JE' and 'I have a female for him' Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: 'He just did a good one - 18 years. (She spoke to me and said, "I love Jeffrey"). The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to Epstein's celebrity friends including the business magnate Donald Trump, film producer Harvey Weinstein and magician David Copperfield, referred to as 'Magic David'. The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Epstein's massages, many of which were 'erotic' and allegedly involved the abused girls. The evidence is from documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into Epstein and seen yesterday by the Mail. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030519 

Message from a child asking what time to leave school Miss Maxwell is asked when a girl should give a massage One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' It was left in February 2005 - the same year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to Epstein's abuse. Another note shows that "Colleen' phoned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class - will be out in 45 min.' Last night the Daily Mail tried to contact the people whose names and telephone numbers are included in the logs. One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung up immediately when asked about Epstein. A man listed only as Darren said: 'I have no comment to make on that.'

Date: Tuesday, March 8 2011 08:40 PM Subject: Re: Looking for someone who made the early bet that Middle East would implode... From: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> To: Jeffrey and Ghislaine: Notes on New York's Oddest Alliance < http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2011/03/notes- on-new-yorks-oddest- couple-jeffrey-epstein-and-ghislaine-maxwell.html> by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky-ward> March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM "I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will never think the same way about anything again." So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment as the alleged "procurer" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called "The Talented Mr. Epstein." It was largely a business piece that focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone- chilling. Journalists from England have phoned-and, in one case, flownto ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight that I have decided to write about this myself. Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. "Do they speak?" I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. "Not like you, Vicky," was his riposte. I remembered that when we'd once discussed math —in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed hadn't studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a book: "Math for idiots." So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. "Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects," newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and you know this to be true. When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that "Andy" —as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far more than "Andy" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030522 

And Ghislaine? Full disclosure: Ilike her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends. Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as "the Tennis Goddess") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. "He saved her," I remember a close friend of mine telling me. "When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will." In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive "black hole" he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a normal life-whatever that is. He had a second "wife" for many years whose existence he has been open about. So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her orto Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes. On Tue, Mar 8, 2011 at 6:10 AM, > wrote: Thanks.

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will never think the same way about anything again." So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment as the alleged "procurer" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called "The Talented Mr. Epstein." It was largely a business piece that focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone- chilling. Journalists from England have phoned-and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight-that I have decided to write about this myself. Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. "Do they speak?" I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. "Not like you, Vicky," was his riposte.

2 Article 1. The Cairo Review of Global Affairs The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Now William B. Quandt Spring 2011 -- The upheaval that shook the Arab world in early 2011 should lead to a fundamental recalibration of American policies in the Middle East. As this debate gets underway, many, perhaps most, will conclude that this is no time for pushing hard for Arab-Israeli peace. They will argue that it is time to let the dust from the Arab revolution settle, to shore up other fragile regimes, and to hope for the best. Certainly the official view from Israel will reinforce such a wait and see attitude. But such a posture, at a time like this, will have the effect of making the United States look marginal to the central developments of the region. While it is true that U.S. influence has waned in recent years-and that need not be such a bad thing-on the issue of Arab-Israeli peace the U.S. still has a major interest and a major responsibility. So, the Obama administration should take a hard look, screw up its courage, and try for a serious multi-pronged effort to get Arab-Israeli peacemaking onto a promising track. If successful-and the odds are admittedly not good this would mean that the U.S. was aligning itself with both democracy and peace in a vital part of the world. That would go a long way toward securing American interests. But, is it doable? The president still has time to make mid-course corrections and start to move in a more promising direction. But time is short and he will have to recognize some of the serious errors he has made if he is to get things right. To have a chance of success, Obama must mobilize a major internationally supported initiative to lay out the broad guidelines, in the form of quite specific principles, for the resolution HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030532 

3 of both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Israeli-Syrian one as well. What went wrong? After all, Obama as a presidential candidate in 2008 seemed to be genuinely committed to trying a new approach to peacemaking. And he seemed to understand that Arab-Israeli peace would make a big dent in the intense anti-Americanism that could be found in much of the Arab and Islamic worlds. Obama got off to a good start in January 2009. He supported the idea of engagement with adversaries, mentioning Iran and Syria by name, and privileging diplomacy over military force. He appointed a respected and experienced former senator, George Mitchell, to oversee the day-to-day conduct of his Arab-Israeli policy. As the national security advisor he named General James Jones, a man with considerable experience with the Palestine issue. In a number of public statements, Obama made it clear that he wanted to move forcefully toward Arab-Israeli peace and he took a particularly firm stand on an issue of great importance to the Palestinians, namely the need for Israel to stop building settlements in occupied territory. Obama's new approach was aptly expressed in his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, in which he said: "I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect." While all of these steps raised hopes in some quarters that American policy was moving into a new and active phase, there were also some warning signs that events might force the new president to trim his ambitions. First there was the obvious fact that the global economic crisis, which significantly worsened in the months before his election, was bound to occupy much of his time and energy. In addition to pushing a stimulus package and bank bailouts to address the economic crisis, his domestic political agenda included passing legislation on health care. These proved also to be difficult and HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030533 

4 divisive tasks, quickly drawing down on the president's political capital. In the Middle East, two elections also made it more difficult for the president to proceed with his initial strategy. First, in Israel, elections resulted in the return of hard-line Likud leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, to the prime minister's office. He had served as prime minister in the period 1996-1999 and had strenuously resisted U.S. efforts to move forward on Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. To say the least, his reputation in Washington was that of a stubborn and unimaginative leader who was unwilling to take risks for peace. The other election that damaged the chances for Obama to pursue his plans to engage constructively with adversaries took place in Iran in June 2009 and was widely viewed in the West as a deeply flawed affair that cheated the reformist movement of a possible victory. Instead of dealing with Iranian moderates, Obama would have to deal with a reinstated President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Many Americans were highly skeptical about the wisdom of trying to pursue a policy of engagement with this Iranian regime, especially as it continued to follow a policy of producing nuclear energy that led many to believe Iran was on its way to becoming a nuclear weapons state in violation of its commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Netanyahu Problem Obama and Netanyahu did not get off to a very good start. With some effort, Obama did help persuade Netanyahu to express guarded support for the so-called 'two-state solution' to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but he had a much harder time persuading the Israeli prime minister to stop building settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. This latter point became a test of wills between the two leaders, and finally in late 2009 Netanyahu gave a partial concession—a moratorium on new settlement construction in the HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030534 

5 West Bank (but not east Jerusalem) for a period of ten months. By the time this offer was made, Obama and his political advisors were showing signs of being worried about the prolonged strain in U.S.- Israeli relations. Many seemed to feel that it was time for the president to mend fences and to accept what Netanyahu had offered as a positive first step. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, long attuned to the domestic politics surrounding the management of the relationship with Israel from her time as senator from New York state, was quick to label Netanyahu's offer of a ten-month moratorium as "unprecedented" —which was not true-—and to turn to the Palestinians with demands that they agree to enter negotiations. "If there is indeed still a window of opportunity for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, it may not remain open for long. And if Obama does not try to break the impasse, it is unlikely that his eventual successor will do so." During the first part of 2010, there was very little real movement in Arab-Israeli peace diplomacy. Mitchell travelled diligently to the region, but his style was so low-key that whatever gains he made were barely noticed. In mid year, Obama and Netanyahu met in Washington for a carefully staged reconciliation meeting. With Congressional elections on the horizon, Obama presumably did not want to burden Democratic candidates with the charge that the Obama administration was excessively tough in its dealings with Israel. Exactly what happened during the meeting between the two leaders is not clear. It seems that Netanyahu made a strong case for U.S. support in confronting Iran; and in return for U.S. assurances on this score, he agreed to enter "direct negotiations without preconditions" with the Palestinians. White House Middle East advisors began to talk about a "new Netanyahu," a strong leader who would be prepared to make concessions for peace. The "old Netanyahu," a man whose HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030535
