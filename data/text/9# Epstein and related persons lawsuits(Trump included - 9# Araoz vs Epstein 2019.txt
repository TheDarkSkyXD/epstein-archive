raping Ms. Araoz. As such Respondent has committed sexual assault, sexual battery, 
intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress 
pursuant to New York common law. The damage Respondent Epstein inflicted upon 


Petitioner has been severe and lasting. 


5: As per the New York Child Victim’s Act passed in January 2019 the 
complaint against Epstein may not be filed until August 14, 2019, [For a copy of 
complaint to be filed see Exhibit “A”] 

6. This pre-commencement Petition seeks the identity of the recruiter who 
conspired with Epstein to identify Petitioner as a potential sexual abuse victim of Epstein 
and facilitated the grooming of Petitioner as part of the readying of Ms. Araoz to be 
sexually assaulted by Epstein. The identify of the recruiter is not currently known to 


Petitioner. 


Pre-Action Disclosure is Necessary and Appropriate 


ds Since the identity of the recruiter is not currently known to Petitioner but 
may be known to Respondent, pre-action disclosure, including a deposition of Epstein

she may be included as a defendant in the action to be filed on August 14, 2019. 

8. Upon the identification of the recruiter, she will be added as a defendant to 
the action to be commenced on August 14, 2019. Further, the recruiter possesses critical 
evidence of Petitioner’s sexual assault claims. 

7 A deposition of Epstein may reveal the recruiter’s identity either directly 
or through questioning that develops identifying facts that permit further investigation to 


identify the recruiter. [A copy of a subpoena for Epstein is attached as Exhibit “Bol

Il. 


ARAOZ AND THE RECRUITER 


8. Ms. Araoz was born in Saint John’s Hospital in Queens on February 5, 
1987. 

2. She grew up poor and largely raised by her mother, a single parent, in 
Middle Village, Queens. 

10. The loss of her father at age 12 caused emotional vulnerability and issues 
surrounding the lack of having a father figure in her life. 

11. Ms. Araoz was a prime target for grooming by a pedophile like Mr. 
Epstein. 

12. In September of 2001, at age 14, Ms. Araoz entered high school. She 
attended a special public high school for performing arts called Talent Unlimited High 
School, where she majored in musical theater (7.e., singing, dancing, acting). 

13. Its campus is within the Julia Richman Education Complex along with 
five other schools: Urban Academy, Vanguard High School, P226M Junior High Annex, 


Ella Baker Elementary School, and Manhattan International High School.

14. Because Talent Unlimited High School is a special high school for the 
performing arts, students audition to be accepted. The School had approximately 500 
students. 

LS. During the first semester of Ms. Araoz’s freshman year of high school, 
while she was 14 years old, after school one day, she was approached by a brunette 
woman, who appeared to be in her early 20s, on the side walk in front of her school. The 
woman, who we shall refer to as “the Recruiter,” tried to befriend her. 

16. She asked her where Ms. Araoz lived, where her parents were, if they 
were together, where she was born and where her parents worked. 

17. The Recruiter approached Ms. Araoz repeatedly over the course of a week 
or two, offering to take her for lunches close by the school, and during the meals, would 
continue to ask personal questions about her. 

18. At some point during this approximate two week period, the Recruiter 
began to speak about Defendant Epstein, almost as if he was her uncle or a family friend. 

19. The Recruiter said that Epstein was a “nice guy,” and that he takes care of 
her and her family. The Recruiter spoke glowingly of Epstein, stating he is very wealthy, 
and “you have to see his house.” 

20. The Recruiter eventually said that she told Epstein about Ms. Araoz, about 
how pretty and smart she is and about how she recently lost her father to AIDS. 

2 The Recruiter then told Ms. Araoz that Epstein felt horrible about the loss 
of her father and said that he wanted to help her. The Recruiter said that Epstein is a 
“caring guy,” that he said she “should not be struggling,” and that he wanted “to be there 


for her.”

22; The Recruiter then said that she wanted Ms. Araoz to meet Epstein, that 
he knows a lot of people in the acting/modeling world and that he could possibly help her 
and introduce her to the right people for her career; the Recruiter said Epstein wanted to 
“guide her.” 

23. The Recruiter said that he was “very caring, very wealthy, very successful, 
and someone good to know.” 

24. The Recruiter said that if Ms. Araoz did not want to meet Epstein, she did 
not have to, but doing so could “benefit her.” The Recruiter also enticed Ms. Araoz by 
repeatedly saying how Epstein’s home is so beautiful, and that it was “right here” by Ms. 
Araoz’s high school. 

25; The Recruiter said that they could go by Epstein’s house together. 

26. One day, the Recruiter made plans with Ms. Araoz to meet after school to 
visit Epstein’s home and meet him. 

Il. 


EPSTEIN’S SEXUAL ASSAULT, BATTERY AND RAPE OF MS. ARAOZ 





27. Upon arrival at Epstein’s home at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 
10021, Epstein appeared very welcoming, even humble. 

28. Inside the front door, there were many security cameras pointing in all 
directions. On the little TVs, Ms. Araoz could actually see herself on the camera walking 
inside. 

29. Epstein gave Ms. Araoz a tour of the first floor of the house, but he did not 


show her the massage room — not in the beginning.

30. Instead, during her first time at the 71‘' Street home, he showed her a 
trophy room, as she entered, filled with taxidermied animals he had allegedly hunted over 
the years. 

Ji: The room had marble floors with extremely high ceilings, mahogany 
wood with deep reds, and was filled with exotic, even endangered animals, including a 
giraffe and other rare specimens. There were skins covering parts of the floor with more 
exotic animals. 

32. As one might expect, Epstein’s home was massive. When one walked in, 
the huge entry door was in the middle of the city block and, upon entry, there was a small 
marble staircase in the entryway. 

33. To the left there was Epstein’s Secretary’s office with a waiting room, 
couches and chairs. To the right there was the trophy room filled with hunted animals. 
There was also a kitchen on the same floor. As one kept walking forward, there was a 
spiral staircase with a self-portrait of Epstein on the wall with a young girl, who Epstein 
said he considered like a daughter. 

34. On Ms. Araoz’s first visit, she recalls her and the Recruiter waiting for 
Epstein in the Secretary’s office (with the Secretary present behind her desk) until being 
offered cheese, crackers and wine in the kitchen by other staff. 

35. At this point, Epstein showed up to greet the girls and showed Ms. Araoz 
the trophy room, which he appeared to be very proud of. 

36. At the end of this first visit, Ms. Araoz recalls Epstein giving the Recruiter 
a gift — a digital camera. The Recruiter then said to Ms. Araoz, “You see what I mean, 


he’s such a nice guy.”

37. Epstein then gave Ms. Araoz $300 on this first visit, and said, “Here’s a 
little something to help you out. I take care of the people I care about.” 

38. | Healso told Ms. Araoz that he was “a big AIDS activist,” which meant a 
lot to Ms. Araoz at the time, because her father had recently passed away from the 
disease. 

39. — After an hour or two, Ms. Araoz and the Recruiter left together. 

40. Within a couple days, the Recruiter reached out to Ms. Araoz and said that 
she made a great impression on Epstein and that he wanted to see her again. 

41. Atthe time, Ms. Araoz figured there was no harm as Epstein’s house was 
only a couple blocks from her high school and, at this point, he had done nothing to her to 
give her pause or cause her concern. 

42. So, again, the Recruiter brought Araoz back to Epstein’s 71st Street home 
after school. 

43. The second time Ms. Araoz went to Epstein’s house, he gave Ms. Araoz 
the same camera that he had previously given the Recruiter on Ms. Araoz’s first visit to 
his home. 

44. Ms. Araoz visited Epstein’s home with the Recruiter about once or twice a 
week for the first month. Each time, Ms. Araoz stayed between 1-2 hours, and at the end 
of the stay, Epstein would direct his Secretary to give her $300 and just say that he 
“wanted to help her out,” while she and the Recruiter would be served cheese, crackers 
and wine by the Maid. 

45. Ms. Araoz repeatedly discussed with Epstein that she was a freshman at a 
performing arts high school right down the street and that her dream was to be an actress 


and singer.

46. After about a month of making these visits with the Recruiter, Epstein’s 
Secretary began contacting Ms. Araoz directly and scheduling arrangements for her to 
visit Epstein’s home alone. 

47. At this point, during Araoz’s first visit alone, Epstein took Araoz on the 
elevator for the first time and showed her his massage room on one of the upper floors. 

48. The ceilings of most of the rooms of the house were painted with ornate 
murals to look like ancient Rome, Greece, and even the Sistine Chapel. 

49. — Upon showing Ms. Araoz his massage room for the first time, Epstein 
said, “I want to show you something now. I love this room. It’s my favorite room in the 
house.” 

50. | The massage room was on the smaller side compared to the other rooms in 
the house. The ceiling was painted to look like a blue sky with clouds and angels to give 
the appearance that you were in heaven. 

51. Epstein showed Ms. Araoz the art work in the room and the massage table, 
stating that “not many people know about this room.” He then stated, “You really should 
be a model,” “You’re beautiful,” “Ill bet your body is incredible,” and “In order to help 
you with your modeling career, I will need to see your body.” 

52. Epstein had a lot of paintings of nude women on the walls. He even 
commented on one painting of a nude woman with small breasts and brunette hair, but 
you couldn’t see her face clearly because she was partially turned. That painting was 
right behind the massage table, and he said how much the woman in the picture looked 
like Ms. Araoz, then 14 years old. 

53. He said he liked “girls with small breasts” because they were “natural and 


real.” He then complimented Ms. Araoz repeatedly about her breasts.

54. He then told Ms. Araoz again that she would “do great” in the modeling 
industry, and said that he had a lot of connections in the modeling industry and could 
help her. 

a2: Still in the massage room, Epstein asked Ms. Araoz to take her top off so 
he could see her body and frame, which he insinuated he needed to see if he was going to 
help her with modeling. He was very complimentary. 

56. Feeling uncomfortable and confused, Ms. Araoz did as Epstein instructed. 
Epstein then immediately started feeling Ms. Araoz’s breasts and rubbing her nude 
shoulders. 

57. He then asked her if she was good at giving massages and, considering all 
of the financial help he had been giving her family over the past month, insinuated that he 
would like one. Epstein then walked out of the room and returned in a bathrobe. He 
instructed Ms. Araoz to remove everything but her bottom underwear, and laid down on 
the massage table (with only a towel on) instructing Ms. Araoz to proceed with a back 
massage. Ms. Araoz recalls Epstein having a lot of birth marks and/or freckles on his 
back. 

58. After massaging Epstein’s back for about 20 to 25 minutes, Epstein 
suddenly turned over, removed his towel and began masturbating. 

2: Ms. Araoz, feeling uncomfortable and intimated, stood frozen to the side 
of the massage table as Epstein ejaculated on himself. 

60. Ms. Araoz recalls Epstein also having a lot of birth marks and/or freckles 
around his genitalia area. 

61. — Epstein’s exposing his penis made Ms. Araoz extremely nervous and 


uncomfortable, but she felt intimidated so she did as she was told.

62. Also, Epstein insinuated that because of the money he gave her, she owed 
him. Epstein said, “I take care of you, you take care of me.” 

63. He was giving Ms. Araoz instructions and telling her what to do the entire 
time. Epstein ultimately ejaculated on himself, and then it ended. 

64. —_ He said, “This was amazing, you’re beautiful, I can’t wait to see you 
again. I will give you a call during the week and we’ |l see each other again.” 

65. Going forward, sometimes Epstein would call Ms. Araoz directly, and 
other times he would have the Secretary email or page Ms. Araoz. 

66. | Ms. Araoz remembers after the first sexual encounter with Epstein, he 
showed her a room on the same floor as the massage room that he said was designed to 
look like his favorite room at the White House, which he called the “Blue Room.” It was 
blue and had a distinct oval shape. He then showed her some more artwork, his master 
bedroom with a large jacuzzi and prosthetic breasts on the wall in a bathroom that he 
could look at or play with while in the bathtub. 

67. These sexual encounters with Epstein, which of course were horribly 
abusive sexual assaults of a child, became more aggressive and escalated. For example, 
the second time it occurred, while Epstein started to masturbate, he grabbed Ms. Araoz's 
breasts hard without asking and, this time, insisted that Ms. Araoz rub his chest, arms and 
legs, and pinch his nipples, which he said was one of the main things that turned him on 
sexually. 

68. These encounters would continue on a weekly basis, once or twice a week, 
throughout the first and second semester of Ms. Araoz’s freshman year of high school 


and through the beginning of the first semester of her sophomore year of high school.

69. A maid would leave $300 for Ms. Araoz in a drawer in the massage room 
(the same drawer each time), and as Epstein left the room, he would state that he had left 
something for her to help her family. At the time, this was a lot of money to Ms. Araoz. 

70. Later on, this became routine where Epstein would have his maid send 
Ms. Araoz upstairs to the massage room. The maid would put towels and lotions out and 
tell Araoz to get changed in the bathroom. 

Fs When one walked in the massage room, there was the painting of a nude 
woman, previously mentioned. To the right, there was the massage table, and to the right 
of the massage table, there was a bathroom, which is where Araoz would be directed to 
get changed. 

72. Finally, one day, during the Fall of her sophomore year of high school 
(while she was still 15 years old), she was giving Epstein a massage in her underwear, as 
she had routinely been instructed to do, but this time instead of turning over to masturbate 
and fondle her breasts, while she stood off to the side of the massage table, Epstein 
became more aggressive with her and started touching her vaginal area. 

73. | He said, “Why don’t we do it where you’re on top of me massaging me 
and take your underwear off.” 

74. Ms. Araoz said to Epstein that this made her uncomfortable and she 
wanted to stick to what they were doing before. 

75. Epstein responded that he “loved her and cared for her,” was going to 
“look out for her,” that it “was okay” and that she should just climb on top of him and 
“try something different.” 

76. Ms. Araoz felt completely intimidated and did not know what to do, so she 


just did as she was told and got on top of him.

77. Epstein masturbated, as Ms. Araoz rubbed his chest. 

78. Then, all of a sudden, without giving Ms. Araoz any notice, Epstein forced 
his penis (which already had massage oils on it) inside her vagina and proceeded to have 
sex with her. 

79.  Araoz was petrified, felt trapped and didn’t know what to do, so she just 
did as she was told. Epstein held her tightly and forcibly raped her. 

80. On top of this brutal rape, Epstein did not use a condom, which 
substantially contributed to extreme emotional distress and the development of a panic 
disorder, which was exacerbated by the fact that Ms. Araoz had recently lost her father to 
AIDS. 

81. In addition to constituting illicit sex with a minor, this was also a brutal 
rape. 

82.  Epstein’s monstrous conduct cannot be understated. 

83. Epstein, after raping Ms. Araoz, told her that “she was amazing, that she 
felt amazing, and that she did nothing wrong.” 

84. Ms. Araoz was disgusted with Epstein (and herself at the time) and left his 
home soon thereafter, never to return. 

85. Afterward, Epstein tried to contact Ms. Araoz, but she ignored all of his 
calls. 

86. Epstein also tried to reach out to Ms. Araoz in later years, but she did not 
take his calls. 

87. Following the rape, Ms. Araoz refused to go back to Talent Unlimited 
High School out of fear of seeing Epstein, who lived just blocks away from her high 


school, or seeing the Recruiter again.

88. At the time, Ms. Araoz told her mom the reason was that she was being 
bullied at school concealing from her the truth involving Epstein, reflecting her extreme 
shame about what she experienced and the intimidation she felt from Epstein. 

89. Ms. Araoz, still 15 years old at the time, transferred to Forest Hills High 
School in Queens by her home to avoid any continued contact with Epstein and the 
Recruiter. 

90. Having left a special public high school for performing arts that she had to 
audition to get into, to instead go to a regular high school, caused Ms. Araoz to lose 


interest in school, drop out, and give up on her career of being an actress, model and 


singer.
