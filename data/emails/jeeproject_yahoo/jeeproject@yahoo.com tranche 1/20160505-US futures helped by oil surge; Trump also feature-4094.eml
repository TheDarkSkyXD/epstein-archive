Hedge fund billionaire David Einhorn , head of Greenlight Capital, said at Sohn he's short Caterpillar (CAT) and long General Motors (GM), as the former faces a decline in some of its core businesses and the latter tightens its belt and faces a stronger future. (CNBC) Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of Social Capital, said at Sohn Amazon (AMZN) will be worth $3 trillion in 10 years, and its retail business unit won't be the biggest factor in driving the shares to that eye-popping value.

 STOCKS TO WATCH

Whole Foods Market (WFM) beat estimates by 3 cents with quarterly profit of 44 cents per share, though revenue came in marginally below forecasts.The organic grocery chain did cut its full-year profit and sales forecast, amid increasing competition and promotional activity.Fitbit (FIT) came in 7 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly earnings of 10 cents per share, while the maker of wearable fitness devices also saw revenue beat forecasts. However, its current quarter forecast was weaker than expected.Zynga (ZNGA) broke even on an adjusted basis for its latest quarter, compared to forecasts of 1 cent per share loss. The online game maker saw revenue beat estimates on increased ad sales, although its customer base did decline.TripAdvisor (TRIP) earned an adjusted 32 cents per share
 for its latest quarter, 14 cents below estimates, and its revenue also missed. The travel website did see more hotel bookings on its website, but that impacted revenue from referrals to other travel sites.21st Century Fox (FOXA) matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 47 cents per share, and the media company's revenue beat forecasts. Fox's results were helped by a rise in ad sales and affiliate fees.MetLife (MET) missed estimates by 18 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.20 per share, while the insurer's revenue fell short of Street estimates as well. MetLife saw lower returns on its various investments as well as higher expenses.Kraft Heinz (KHC) reported quarterly profit of 73 cents per share, 11 cents above estimates, while the food maker's revenue also came in
 above forecasts. The company saw costs fall during the quarter, as well as seeing increased sales for its condiment and sauce products.Weight Watchers (WTW) lost a penny per share less than expected at 17 cents per share, although revenue was below forecasts.
