Swiss bank UBS (UBS) reported earnings that matched forecasts, as wealth management attracted strong inflows. But the UBS saw "abnormally low" transaction volumes in the first quarter as clients became more risk averse. The CEO told CNBC the environment to remain challenging.HSBC (HSBC) reported profit that beat expectations but was down 18 percent from last year's first quarter. Adjusted revenue fell 4 percent. The London-based bank blamed extreme market volatility in January and February for the declines. AIG (AIG) fell 35 cents short of estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 65 cents per share, on a shortfall in income from both underwriting and investments. The weak results come as the insurer faces higher "too big to fail" capital requirements.Mylan (MYL) reported adjusted
 quarterly profit of 76 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, although the drugmaker's revenue was slightly below forecasts. Sales did increase by 17 percent from a year earlier on improved sales of generic drugs.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) reported quarterly profit of 50 cents per share, 4 cents below estimates, although the restaurant chain's revenue matched forecasts as same-restaurant sales rose 4.6 percent.
