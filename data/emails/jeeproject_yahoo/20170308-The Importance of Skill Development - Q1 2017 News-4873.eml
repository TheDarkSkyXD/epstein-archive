It is as important to us as it is to you that you are successful and prof=
icient.                          =20

Quarterly Update Q1 2017

EXECUTIVE CORNER   =20
The Importance of Skill Development

At Financial Navigator, it is just as important to us as it is to you tha=
t you are successful with our reporting platform. As we add the features =
you want and as the complexity of the program increases, we accept the re=
sponsibility to assist your staff in increasing their proficiency. This q=
uarter=E2=80=99s newsletter describes some of the options we have found t=
o be most valuable to both principals and staff who operate our system.

Knowledge and Skills Required
As a user of the Financial Navigator platform, you know the breadth of th=
e product. It enables you to manage the following areas:

Investment tracking and reporting  Accounting, financial reporting and ca=
sh management  Information for preparation of income taxes

In a small firm, you may have major responsibilities for all of these=E2=80=
=94and for seeing that the computer systems are updated appropriately. Th=
e fewer the staff in an office, the more expertise each member must have-=
-and constantly improve --to keep the office working effectively.

Of course, some staff within an office may well be able to provide helpfu=
l suggestions when, for example, a routine report shows unexpected result=
s. Outside contractors, too, can solve problems. As long as these others =
are available and the staff can describe the problem that is occurring, w=
ork will proceed in a timely and efficient manner.

The Technical Support Team at FNI supports all users regardless of their =
expertise; however, when your staff has the vocabulary to describe a prob=
lem and understand the solution proposed, our team is faster and more tho=
rough in its assistance to you.

Criteria for Selecting a Training Program
We understand the challenge of staff development. After all, you call us =
with your most difficult problems, and we have to be prepared to help you=
. So training our staff is extremely important for us. Perhaps the traini=
ng solutions that work for us will work for you.

Two criteria loom large when we judge training programs for our staff: Ma=
ke sure  the material is easy to access [http://blog.finnav.com/educatio=
n/the-importance-of-skill-development] and make sure  it is excellent [h=
ttp://blog.finnav.com/education/the-importance-of-skill-development]. Our=
 stance is that the cost of the program is secondary to its quality.

Two Specific Training Programs
In addition to specific training in software systems, at Financial Naviga=
tor we focus our training on two additional areas, overall  financial ski=
lls [http://blog.finnav.com/education/the-importance-of-skill-developmen=
t] and  IT staff skills [http://blog.finnav.com/education/the-importance=
-of-skill-development].

Two articles below describe in more detail these two training programs. E=
ach is written by Financial Navigator staff who are constantly training t=
o be effective members of our Technical Support Team.

Experience has shown us that a serious commitment to training and skill d=
evelopment of your staff is an invaluable investment from which you will =
reap many rewards.

Happy Navigating!

Validating Your Professional Credibility=20
[http://blog.finnav.com/education/validating-your-credibility-as-a-profe=
ssional] =20
Earning a college degree in a specialized field shows a student=E2=80=99s=
 ability to learn and understand the core concepts behind the subject. In=
 the financial industry, a graduate must expand from just the basic under=
standings and concepts of the modern financial world. As the industry cha=
nges constantly and rapidly, the struggle to keep current can seem diffic=
ult and exhausting.   =20

However, we can maintain our expertise. We can stand out from the crowd b=
y obtaining the knowledge and skill-sets needed to retain our credibility=
. Credibility allows clients to take us seriously, to trust our opinions.=
 We must be able to prove to them that they have chosen the right person =
to perform the task at hand. To do this, we must understand the issue and=
 effectively communicate back. One of the key steps in making this possib=
le and allowing the client to know that we have what it takes is to prove=
 our professional competency.  =20

What better way to prove that we are the right fit for the job than by ob=
taining the professional certificates pertinent to our career?           =
                      =20


Improving your IT Skills=20
[http://blog.finnav.com/education/improving-your-it-skills]   =20

An important concern when helping clients troubleshoot their software is =
minimizing down time. And rightly so. Accountants need to enter a great n=
umber of transactions into their systems, they need to create reports, an=
d they also need to meet deadlines. In order to resolve an issue quickly,=
 the user of the software and the technician must engage in efficient com=
munications. A user who has a basic understanding of Information Technolo=
gy (IT) and accounting increases the efficiency of the communications and=
 therefore increases productivity. In my opinion, this is why a well-roun=
ded and life-long education is imperative.   Technology continues to beco=
me a greater part of everyday life in most professions, and professionals=
 must adapt or get left behind. Fortunately, multiple resources are avail=
able over the internet to be used for self-study. I personally do not thi=
nk certification in IT is important unless IT is your career path. Learni=
ng the material is much more important.   =20

 > An important concern when helping clients troubleshoot their software =
is minimizing down time. And rightly so. Accountants need to enter a grea=
t number of transactions into their systems, they need to create reports,=
 and they also need to meet deadlines. In order to resolve an issue quick=
ly, the user of the software and the technician must engage in efficient =
communications. A user who has a basic understanding of Information Techn=
ology (IT) and accounting increases the efficiency of the communications =
and therefore increases productivity. In my opinion, this is why a well-r=
ounded and life-long education is imperative.

 >Technology continues to become a greater part of everyday life in most =
professions, and professionals must adapt or get left behind. Fortunately=
, multiple resources are available over the internet to be used for self-=
study. I personally do not think certification in IT is important unless =
IT is your career path. Learning the material is much more important.
