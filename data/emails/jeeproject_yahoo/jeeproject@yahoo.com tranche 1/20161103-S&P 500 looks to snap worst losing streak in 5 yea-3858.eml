grabbed a record market share  in the third-quarter at the expense of Apple's (AAPL) iOS which posted a decline, according to new research.
STOCKS TO WATCH

Qualcomm (QCOM) beat forecasts by 15 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.28 per share, while the chipmaker's revenue also came in above forecasts. Strong demand for the company's smartphone chips helped drive the quarter, with particular strength in the China market.
21st Century Fox (FOXA) reported adjusted quarterly profit of 51 cents per share, exceeding estimates by 7 cents, while revenue was essentially in line. The media giant was helped by strong results at the movie box office as well as its cable division.
Wynn Resorts (WYNN) missed estimates by 3 cents, with adjusted quarterly profit of 75 cents per share, with revenue essentially in line. The casino operator's results were pressured by an 11.5 percent drop in revenue from Macau, though that market has shown signs of recovering.
Credit Suisse (CS) delivered better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter, with the Swiss bank noting positive trends in its operations amid restructuring and cost-cutting.
AIG (AIG) reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.23 per share, 2 cents above estimates. The insurer's profit compared to a year-ago loss, when AIG was hit by poor investment results.Additionally, AIG's board authorized an additional $3 billion for its share buyback program.
Avis Budget (CAR) beat estimates by 14 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.47 per share, and the car rental giant's revenue was essentially in line.However, its full-year earnings guidance is below forecasts on softer demand both in the Americas and Europe.
First Solar (FSLR) reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.22 per share, well above estimates of 74 cents per share, though revenue was well below estimates. However, First Solar also cut its sales forecast.
