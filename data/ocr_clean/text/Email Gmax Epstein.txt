Re: Heads up
Importance:
High
I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives
you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive
benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is
possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political
correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.

T hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you-either on air or in scrum
afterwards.
