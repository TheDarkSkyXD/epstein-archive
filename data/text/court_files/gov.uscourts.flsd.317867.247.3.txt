Eleventh Circuit rules that discovery
can move forward on my Crime
Victims' Rights Act case
By Paul Cassell Updated: April 21 at 9:41 am
On Friday the 11th Circuit ruled that discovery can move forward in an important
Crime Victims' Rights Act case that my co-counsel, Brad Edwards, and I are
pursuing. The narrow issue before the court was whether prosecutors and defense
attorneys could assert some sort of "privilege" to prevent crime victims from
reviewing the correspondence that lead to a plea bargain. More broadly, the ruling
means that the victims will have a chance to return to the district court and seek to
invalidate a plea agreement that (we alleged) was consummated in violation of their
rights. I hope that the case will ultimately set an important precedent that federal
prosecutors can't keep victims in the dark about the plea deals that they reach.
Here are the important facts, taken from the 11th Circuit's opinion: The case arose in
2006, the FBI began investigating allegations that wealthy investor Jeffrey Epstein
had sexually abused dozens and dozens of minor girls. The U.S. Attorney's Office for
the Southern District of Florida accepted Epstein's case for prosecution, and the FBI
issued victim notification letters to my two clients, minors Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane
Doe No. 2, in June and August 2007. Extensive plea negotiations ensued between the
prosecutors and Epstein. On Sept. 24, 2007, the prosecutors entered into a non-
prosecution agreement with Epstein in which they agreed not to file any federal
charges against Epstein in exchange for his guilty plea to minor Florida offenses (e.g.,
solicitation of prostitution). Not only did the prosecutors neglect to confer with the
victims before they entered into the agreement with Epstein, they also concealed its
existence for at least nine months. For example, the prosecutors sent post-agreement
letters to the victims reporting that the "case is currently under investigation" and
explaining that "It]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued
patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.
On June 27, 2008, the prosecutors informed my co-counsel, Brad Edwards, that
Epstein planned to plead guilty to the Florida charges three days later. But the
prosecutors failed to disclose that Epstein's pleas to those state charges arose from his
federal non-prosecution agreement and that the pleas would bar a federal prosecution.
As a result, the victims did not attend the state court proceedings.
On July 7, 2008, Edwards and I filed a petition alleging that Jane Doe No. 1 was a
victim of federal sex crimes committed by Epstein and that the United States had
wrongfully excluded her from plea negotiations. We also alleged that the federal
prosecutors had violated her rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA)

specifically her rights to confer with the government, to be treated with fairness, to
receive timely notice of relevant court proceedings, and to receive information about
restitution. The United States responded by claiming that it used its "best efforts" to
comply with the rights afforded to victims under the CVRA, but that the act did not
apply to pre-indictment negotiations with potential federal defendants.
After Jane Doe No. 2 joined the initial petition, the district court (Marra, J.) found
that both women qualified as "crime victims" under the CVRA. The district court
later rejected the government's argument that the act only applies after the filing of a
federal criminal indictment. (I've written a law review article about the issue of how
early crime victims' rights attach in the criminal process, which can be downloaded
here.)
Among other relief, we sought rescission of the non-prosecution agreement as a
remedy for the violation of the victims' rights. To make the case for such a remedy,
we moved for discovery of the correspondence between the U.S. and Epstein's
attorneys during the plea negotiations. Epstein's attorneys intervened, arguing that
Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 create a
privilege for plea negotiations, barring release of the correspondence. They also
argued that the court should find that the materials were protected under the work
product doctrine or, alternatively, should be protected under a new "common-law
privilege for plea negotiations.'
The district court first ruled that rescission of the plea agreement was a possible
remedy under the act. The court then ruled that we were entitled to review the
correspondence, rejecting all of Epstein's arguments.
On Friday, the 11th Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling that we could review
the plea correspondence. At pp. 18-22 of its published opinion, the court concluded
that there was no basis for restricting access to such correspondence when crime
victims have a legitimate need to review it. The court rejected, for example, the work
product argument because plea discussions are not confidential:
Disclosure of work-product materials to an adversary waives the work-product
privilege. See, e.g., In re Chrysler Motors Corp. Overnight Evaluation Program
Litig., 860 F.2d 844, 846 (8th Cir. 1988); In re Doe, 662 F.2d 1073, 1081-82 (4th Cir.
1981). Even if it shared the common goal of reaching a quick settlement, the United
States was undoubtedly adverse to Epstein during its investigation of him for federal
offenses, and the intervenors' disclosure of their work product waived any claim of
privilege....
The court also declined to recognize a new privilege for plea bargaining, finding the
relationship between prosecutors and defense attorneys did not need special
protection:
As a last-ditch effort, the intervenors contend that "Eilf more is needed in addition to
the plain language of Rule 410 to preclude disclosure of the correspondence to
plaintiffs, it can be found in the conjunction of Rule 410, the work-product privilege,
and the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in the plea
bargaining process," but this novel argument fails too. As explained above, Rule 410

does not create a privilege and the intervenors waived any work-product privilege.
The intervenors concede too that the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment had
not yet attached when the correspondence was exchanged. Lumley v. City of Dade
City, Fla., 327 F.3d 1186, 1195 (11th Cir. 2003) ("[T]he Sixth Amendment right to
counsel ordinarily does not arise until there is a formal commitment by the
government to prosecute," such as a "formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment,
information, or arraignment."). The "conjunctive" power of three false claims of
privilege does not rescue the correspondence from disclosure. ...
The Supreme Court has identified several considerations relevant to whether a court
should recognize an evidentiary privilege—the needs of the public, whether the
privilege is rooted in the imperative for confidence and trust, the evidentiary benefit
of the denial of the privilege, and any consensus among the states, Jaffee v. Redmond,
518 U.S. 1, 10-15 (1996) but none of these considerations weighs in favor of
recognizing a new privilege to prevent discovery of the plea negotiations. Although
plea negotiations are vital to the functioning of the criminal justice system, a
prosecutor and target of a criminal investigation do not enjoy a relationship of'
confidence and trust when they negotiate. Their adversarial relationship, unlike the
confidential relationship of a doctor and patient or attorney and client, warrants no
privilege beyond the terms of Rule 410. See Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 10. But the victims
would enjoy an evidentiary benefit from the disclosure of plea negotiations to prove
whether the United States violated their rights under the Act.
Moving forward, this case raises the important issue of what kinds of remedies are
available for violations of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. Our complaint alleges that,
prodded by Epstein, the federal prosecutors deliberately concealed the sweetheart
plea deal they had reached with him to avoid public criticism of the deal. I am
hopeful that in future district court proceedings, we will be able to prove that clear
violation of the CVRA and then obtain the remedy of invalidating the illegally-
negotiated plea deal.

The ruling also dismissed Epstein's claims that a federal rule of evidence protects his plea correspondence. That rule
applies only to detendants who withdraw a guilty plea. Because he pleaded guilty, that doesn't apply, the ruling says.
"While respectiul of the panel's decision, given issues of overriding importance to the criminal justice system regarding the
need for continued confidentiality for communications between defense lawyers and prosecutors, we will be petitioning the
court of appeals for further review," said Boston based attorney Martin Weinberg, who represents Epstein.
The U.S. Attorney's Office failed to notify victims prior to striking a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein on Sept. 24,
2007, and didn't tell them of the agreement's existence for at least nine months, the ruling says.
On June 27, 2008, the U.S. Attorney's Office told the victims that Epstein planned to plead guilty to state charges three
days later. But federal prosecutors failed to disclose that his pleas to the state charges arose from his federal non-
prosecution agreement and would bar federal charges.
Jane Does No. 1 and No. 2, who were, respectively, 12 and 13 at the time they were victimized, received confidential
monetary settlements in civil cases.
They are among more than two dozen underage girls who filed lawsuits or settled claims against Epstein. All alleged they
were lured to his Palm Beach mansion to give him sexually charged massages and/or sex in exchange for money.
"A well-connected billionaire got away with molesting many girls," Edwards said. "These girls should at least know how and
why he was able to get away with these crimes. This ruling will allow us access to the documents that will provide insight
into how that happened. I suspect that the answers revealed by these documents will uitimately allow us to invalidate that
agreement and permit prosecution of Mr. Epstein."

I agree with the post by the palm bleacher. This guy is a perv and needs to sit out of society. When listening to his
depositions he pretended to be insulted by the questions being asked of him and his lawyer shut it down quickly What
remains to be seen is if the soon to be released files will bear the fruit we all hope it does My worry is that the tracks will be
covered and he will not get his due
His opinion of himself allows him to think he did nothing wrong and these BABIES he molested were not of his place n
society and were simply objects to be thrown away What would he think if someone did that to his BABIES if he has any?
can bet that the full force of his money would work against whomever played with his kids. ...bloody gross!

Victims win right to see negotiations that led to 'lenient' plea
agreement for billionaire sex offender
Latest in legal saga involving Jeffrey Epstein, 61, financier convicted of procuring
minor for prostitution
By Brett Clarkson, Sun Sentinel
7:43 PM EDT, April 21, 2014
Did a Palm Beach billionaire being investigated for having sex with young girls use his
wealth to negotiate a lenient and secret agreement that saw him avoid federal
prosecution?
Attorneys for two victims, known only as Jane Doe 1 and 2, may soon get an answer thanks to an
appeals court ruling against financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, 61.
The ruling, issued Friday, orders federal authorities to disclose the correspondence that took place
between Epstein's attorneys and federal prosecutors when they were negotiating a 2007 agreement,
which allowed him to escape federal prosecution if he pleaded guilty to state charges that carried a
lesser penalty.
"We're trying to figure out if Epstein used his political connections and great wealth to secure this
kind of arrangement, that was unheard of, frankly, if you look at these charges,'
" said Paul Cassell, an
attorney for the women.
Epstein is a native New Yorker who according to media reports built a huge fortune as a money
manager and owns several properties including a primary residence in Manhattan, a Palm Beach
mansion and his own island in the Caribbean. At one point he counted among his friends former
President Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and other high-powered figures.
The appeal court decision described the background of Epstein's case, stating that in 2006, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation "began investigating allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused
several minor giris.'
In September 2007, federal prosecutors struck the non-prosecution deal with Epstein, but didn't tell
the victims, court filings say.
"Not only did the United States neglect to confer with the victims before it entered into the agreement
with Epstein, it also failed to notify them of its existence for at least nine months," Circuit Judge
William H. Pryor wrote in the appeals court decision.

In June 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring a person under the age of 18 for
prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He spent 13 months behind bars, and is
registered as a sex offender in Florida.
The situation also resulted in civil suits being filed against Epstein, who according to media reports
settled claims from about two dozen young women who alleged he paid them for sexual massages at
his Palm Beach mansion, some as young as 14, according to media reports.
To the attorneys who represent the Jane Does 1 and 2, the sentence was much lighter than the years,
or possibly decades, that Epstein could've spent behind bars had he been prosecuted in the federal
system.
They're hoping that the correspondence, ordered released by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals,
will shed light on what they say is an unusually lenient deal.
"I can say that I've been teaching criminal law for more than two decades and I have never seen a plea
agreement as lenient as this one, for hands-on sex offenders," said Cassell, who is based in Salt Lake
City.
But one of Epstein's attorney's, Martin Weinberg,
based in Boston, disputed those characterizations.
Weinberg said Monday that the plea agreement was "reached in good faith" and that "it's not a fair
conclusion" to describe the agreement as either improper or tainted by Epstein's wealth.
"It's Mr. Cassell's hope that this correspondence may support that theory, but the reality is that the
U.S. Attorney's Office made a responsible judgment in how to implement the law," Weinberg said.
Weinberg said he was concerned about the potential impact the ruling would have on the ability of
criminal defense attorneys and prosecutors to communicate confidentially.
He also said he and Epstein co-counsel, Miami criminal defense attorney Roy Black, will ask the
Atlanta-based appeals court to review the decision.
As for the Jane Does, who are now over 18, it's just the latest development in a long legal saga,
another one of their attorneys said.
"They're pretty numb at this point to favorable news because they've heard this before and nothing's
happened," said Fort Lauderdale attorney Brad Edwards.
Edwards and Cassel said their goal is to have Epstein's plea agreement deemed to be in violation of
federal victims' rights legislation and invalidated. Edwards said Epstein should face a new
prosecution.
Edwards also said he was first told by the U.S. Attorney's Office that he would receive the
correspondence documents on Monday, but was then told that they weren't ready yet. Cassell said the
documents number 500 pages.
In an email, Annette Castillo, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of
Florida, said the office couldn't comment.

BYDAPHN URET - PALMBEAC POST ST
A federal appellate court has moved two young victims of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein a step closer
to wiping out a plea deal that prosecutors made behind their backs.
The lith Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that the underage victims were entitled to see all
correspondence between federal prosecutors and Epstein's lawyers regarding a secret 2007 plea deal that
kept Epstein from federal charges in exchange for an 18-month work-release sentence in state prison.
The plea negotiations took place as Epstein litigated a series of now settled civil claims surrounding
allegations that he had sex in his Palm Beach mansion with dozens of underage girls.
The two victims who are seeking the documents are not identified in court documents. They were 12 and 13 at

Appellate ruling could force teds to reconsider sex charges... | www.mypalmbeachposi.com
the time of their liaisons with Epstein, who pleaded guilty to two prostitution solicitation charges. The girls
reached an out-of-court settlement with him.
In ruling that the correspondence should be public, the appellate court authorized the release of more than
500 pages of documents. The victims' lawyers would use the documents to prove that, by keeping the
agreement secret, prosecutors violated a federal act aimed at protecting victims' rights.
A win in that battle could invalidate Epstein's agreement with federal prosecutors, allowing them to
reconsider criminal charges, but this time with input from the victims.
Epstein's lawyers argued that the correspondence constituted confidential plea negotiations and therefore
should not be shared with the victims' lawyers.
"Although plea negotiations are vital to the functioning of the criminal justice system, a prosecutor and target
of a criminal investigation do not enjoy a relationship of confidence and trust when they negotiate," the
appellate justices wrote, calling the prosecutor-defense attorney relationship adversarial.
They upheld a 2013 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra. He ordered the release of all the plea
documents, but only federal prosecutors complied.
The victims' attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, have called the ruling a victory for the rights of victims
to be heard, even in cases like Epstein's, where federal prosecutors ultimately never filed charges. The victims
were unaware of the plea agreement until three days before Epstein pleaded to the state charges in June 2008.
A federal deal had been in place for nine months by then.
Had prosecutors filed charges and negotiated a plea with Epstein in federal court, they would be barred from
seeking any additional punishment against him. But because his plea agreement to a sex solicitation charge
came in state court, federal prosecutors theoretically could charge him again.
Still, Epstein's lawyers could argue that the only reason he agreed to the state sentence was because he
believed it would free him of the federal charges for good. Edwards said Epstein's attorneys have made parts
of those arguments in pre-trial hearings, and he expects them to appeal Friday's ruling. Epstein's Boston-
based attorney, Martin Weinberg, told the Palm Beach Daily News he would appeal.
"While respectful of the panel's decision, given issues of overriding importance to the criminal justice system
regarding the need for continued confidentiality for communications between defense lawyers and
prosecutors, we will be petitioning the court of appeals for further review," Weinberg told the paper.
Invalidating Epstein's plea would force federal prosecutors to meet with the alleged victims to hear their
comments on whether to pursue charges against Epstein. They still could decline.
"You can't force the federal government to prosecute anyone," Edwards said. "But we're hoping that if maybe
