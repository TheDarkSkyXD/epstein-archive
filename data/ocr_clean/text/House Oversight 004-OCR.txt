Re: Motion to Unseal Briefs (with Names of Victims Redacted) in People v. Epstein, N.Y. Co. Index No. 30129/10 (Appellate Division No. 6081) Dear Sir or Madam: We write on behalf of non-party movant NYP Holdings, Inc., publisher of the New York Post (the "Post"), to withdraw the motion filed by the Post on December 21, 2018 seeking an order to unseal the briefs submitted by the parties in the above-captioned appeal (with the names of victims redacted). Pursuant to NYCRR § 1250.2, we write to inform the Court that the Post hereby withdraws its pending motion without prejudice and expressly reserves the right to reile the motion. See NYCRR § 1250.2(a) ("Withdrawal of Motion. A moving party may file a written request to withdraw a motion at any time prior to its determination"). The Post intends to refile its motion for an order unsealing the briefs (with appropriate redactions), but has withdrawn its pending motion in response to an affidavit submitted by the office of the Manhattan District Attorney on December 28, 2018. That affidavit asserts that the Post was required, but failed, to provide notice of the unsealing motion to "prosecutor's offices in Florida before proceeding with its motion. While the Post firmly believes that it satisfied its obligations by serving the Manhattan District Attorney's office with a copy of its unsealing motion, it wishes to avoid and moot any dispute with the District Attorney's office over whether he notice requirements of the relevant statute were met. Accordingly, the Post will refile its notion to unseal next week and, at that time, will serve its motion papers on the relevant Florid prosecutors, as well as on the parties to the appeal. 4844-9920-0645v. | 3930033-000135 Anchorage | Ballevue | Los Angeles | New York Portland | San Francisco | Seattle | Washington.

Non-party movant NYP Holdings, Inc., publisher of the New York Post (the "Post"), respectfully submits this memorandum of law in support of its motion, filed pursuant to 22 NYCRR § 1250.1(e)(3) and N.Y. Civil Rights Law § 50-b(2)(b), for an order unsealing the briefs filed by the parties in the above-captioned appeal (the "Appeal") with the names of victims of sex crimes redacted. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT The Post seeks to unseal court documents that will shed light on why the Manhattan District Attorney's Office initially sought lenient treatment of billionaire financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In 2008, Epstein pled guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, but there has been suspicion since that time - voiced by members of the judiciary and the press alike - that prosecutors gave Epstein preferential treatment because of his wealth and his political connections to powerful men like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. The handling of criminal proceedings against Epstein by federal prosecutors in Florida and thereafter by the Manhattan District Attorney's office has come under renewed scrutiny after the Miami Herald published a series of investigative articles beginning November 28, 2018, including an article reporting recently that "prosecutors worked to cut him a break" despite strong evidence that he had abused 80 girls and young women. As part of its own news reporting on the New York proceedings against Epstein, the Post seeks to unseal the briefs filed in this Appeal, in which this Court held that Epstein had to register as a level three sex offender in New York, which is the category reserved for highest-risk offenders. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d 570, 570, 933 N. Y.S.2d 239, 240 (1st Dep't 2011). During the Appeal, Epstein argued that his sex offender status should be downgraded to a lower level while the District Attorney's Office argued that the level-three designation was appropriate. 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016488

The District Attorney's position on appeal, however, was in stark contrast to what it argued in proceedings before the lower court, which was that Epstein "should be adjudicated a level one offender" (i.e., lowest risk) in spite of the damning evidence establishing that "defendant committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls." Id. at 570-71, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. The public has the right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney's Office switched its legal position on appeal and what justifications it advanced in its brief to explain its initial request for lenient treatment of Epstein. Similarly, the briefing submitted by Epstein, which confronted the District Attorney's arguments on appeal, may shed additional light on why the District Attorney changed course on appeal. Despite the obvious public interest in knowing this information, the briefs were filed wholly under seal pursuant to New York Civil Rights Law section 50-b - which protects the anonymity of sex abuse victims - and not a single word of either party's briefs is available to the public. Since the District Attorney's Office has made it clear that it will not release any portion of any of the appellate briefs filed in this action without clear instructions from this Court, the Post respectfully requests an order unsealing the briefs and directing the District Attorney to provide the Post with copies redacted only to the extent necessary to preserve the anonymity of victims. As a threshold matter, the Rules of this Court and the common law both guarantee the Post's right to move this Court for an order unsealing court documents (POINT I, supra). And the Post easily demonstrates the "good cause" required to overcome sealing of documents under section 50-b. Simply put, the presumption of openness that governs judicial proceedings in this State is at its zenith because the documents sought by the Post are highly relevant to allegations of prosecutorial missteps and favoritism by the office of the District Attorney in a case involving a powerful sex offender (POINT II, supra). The Post is mindful, however, of the importance of 2 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016489

maintaining anonymity for the victims of sexual assault and respectfully requests that this Court also direct the District Attorney's Office to redact the names of any victims before serving the Post with copies of the redacted appellate briefs. The Post further requests that this Court order the District Attorney's Office to provide the Post with copies of the redacted briefs within seven days of entry of its order granting this motion. FACTUAL BACKGROUND A. Epstein's Conviction for Sex Crimes and Designation as a Level Three Sex Offender In June 2008, a Florida Court sentenced Jeffrey Epstein to eighteen months in prison after he pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a fourteen-year-old girl. Affirmation of John M. Browning dated December 21, 2018 ("Browning Aff."), Ex. A. After serving thirteen months of his sentence, Epstein was released and required to register as a sex offender in New York, where he owned property and sought to reside. Id. Ex. B. The New York State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders ("NYBSO") recommended that Epstein be designated a level three sex offender - which is the level reserved for the most dangerous sexual predators - because investigators in Florida had found compelling evidence that Epstein had abused scores of underage girls, despite only pleading guilty to solicitation of a single minor. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. Remarkably, New York Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Gaffney ignored the NYBSO recommendation and asked the trial court tasked with deciding Epstein's sex-offender status to designate him as a level one offender only, which is the least-restrictive category possible and is typically applied to offenders who pose the lowest risk of committing further crimes. Id. ADA Gaffney argued that, since "there was only an indictment for one victim," Epstein should not be placed under the heavy scrutiny required for the most dangerous class of abusers. Id. Ex. B. For 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 3 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016490

their part, Epstein's lawyers argued that the lowest designation should be applied because "there are no real victims here." Id. Ex. C. In January 2011, the judge presiding over the sex-offender registration proceedings, Justice Ruth Pickholz, rejected ADA Gaffney's arguments and designated Epstein as a level three sex offender. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. At a hearing preceding her ruling, Justice Pickholz told the Assistant District Attorney that she had "never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this" and further stated that she had "done many [cases] much less troubling than this one where [prosecutors] would never make a downward argument like this." Id. Ex. B. When ADA Gaffiney was questioned about whether she knew Epstein had sexually abused other minors, Gaffney admitted that she had never spoken to the federal investigators in Florida who had reached the conclusion that Epstein was a serial abuser of underage girls. Id. Ex. C. B. The Appeal Epstein subsequently commenced this Appeal, seeking to overturn the trial court's ruling that he is a level three sex offender. The appellate briefs submitted by Epstein and the Manhattan District Attorney were filed under seal, pursuant to New York Civil Rights Law section 50-b. Id. 9 7. That statute protects the anonymity "of any victim of a sex offense" by requiring any "court file ... which tends to identify such a victim" to be filed under seal. N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b(1). The statute further provides, however, that court documents filed under seal shall be disclosed if a movant "demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that good cause exists for disclosure to that person." Id. § 50-b(2)(b). In a decision filed on the public docket (the "Decision"'), this Court affirmed Epstein's level three offender status because the lower "court properly relied on highly reliable proof of criminal conduct for which defendant was neither indicted nor convicted." Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 4 4811-3721-9459v 3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016491

570, 933 N. Y.S.2d at 240. Specifically, the "evidence ... established that [Epstein] committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls," who "were brought to [Epstein's] home to provide 'massages' that led to very serious sex crimes." Id. at 570-71, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. - Although the Manhattan District Attorney's briefing remains under seal, the Decision indicates that "the People [took] a different position on appeal from the position they took before the hearing court." Id. at 571, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. This Court did not, however, unseal any of the appeal briefs or provide a detailed summary of the parties' respective arguments. The public and the press are thus left in the dark as to what exactly the District Attorney's Office and Epstein wrote in their respective appeal briefs. It appears that the District Attorney's Office may have taken the position that ADA Gaffney had "mistakenly conceded [before the lower court] that the conduct for which defendant was not indicted should not be considered, and that defendant should be adjudicated a level one offender." Id. at 572, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. The Decision also states that this Court rejected Epstein's argument that the District Attorney "should be estopped" from changing position on appeal and also rejected Epstein's "remaining claims" as being "improperly raised for the first time on appeal." Id. The public has the right to know more than these sketchy details, however, particularly when the arguments advanced by the parties on appeal clearly discuss the decision taken by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to abruptly change its earlier position that Epstein was deserving of lenient treatment. C. Media Interest in New York and Florida Prosecutors' Lenient Handling of Epstein's Case The handling of Epstein's prosecution in Florida and the subsequent sex offender registration proceeding against in him New York have both been the subject of legitimate public interest and intense controversy. In the Florida proceedings, the prosecutors were criticized for allowing Epstein to enter into a seemingly favorable plea deal. For instance, as the Post reported 5 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016492

at the time, the Florida judge sentencing Epstein "was critical of two of the deal's conditions, indicating she thought he was getting special treatment by being allowed private counselling for his sex offender treatment and to serve time in county jail instead of state prison." Samuel Goldsmith, Jeffrey Epstein Pleads Guilty to Prostitution Charges, N.Y. POST (June 30, 2008), available at https://nypost.com/2008/06/30/jeffrey-epstein-pleads-guilty-to-prostitution-charges/. Another serious concern was that Epstein's status as a billionaire investor with powerful connections - including close relationships with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and Prince Andrew - may have influenced prosecutors to give Epstein unduly favorable treatment and to turn a blind eye to the extent of his sexual abuse of minors. Id. There has also been critical reporting on how the Manhattan District Attorney's Office handled Epstein's sex offender registration hearings in New York. After the Post obtained copies of the transcript of the status hearing before Justice Pickholz, it published an article on January 7, 2015, entitled "DA's office "went easy' on sex offender Epstein." Id. Ex. B. In that article, the Post reported that "Prosecutors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal hearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy-rich felon a break on the severity of his sex-offender status ...." Id. In addition to reporting the contents of the hearing transcript, Post reporters also sought to discover why the District Attorney initially sought lenient treatment for Epstein and, as part of its investigation, reached out for comment from the District Attorney's Office. As the article reported, the spokesman for the District Attorney did not give a detailed response on the record but referred the Post instead to the portion of the Decision stating "that the prosecution's position was based "largely on the mistaken notion' that only the formal charges against Epstein could be factors in the decision." Id. The Post was unable to obtain copies of the briefs filed 6 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016493

with the First Department - which would provide a more fulsome explanation of the District Attorney's position - because those documents remained under seal. The prosecution of Epstein has remained in the news and was recently the subject of a wide-ranging investigation by the Miami Herald, which was published on November 28, 2018. Id. Ex. A. One of several in-depth feature articles published by the Miami Herald was entitled "Cops worked to put serial sex abuser in prison. Prosecutors worked to cut him a break." Id. In that article, the Miami Herald reported that investigators uncovered evidence that Epstein had abused "over 100 middle school and high school aged girls," but "despite ample physical evidence and multiple witnesses corroborating the girls' stories, federal prosecutors and Epstein's lawyers quietly put together a remarkable deal for Epstein." Id. Epstein agreed to plead guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute in state court, and in exchange, he and his accomplices received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. Id. More troubling still, Epstein's case file was sealed - including a detailed criminal complaint - so that "no one ... could know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and who else was involved." Id. The Miami Herald's reporting has also had serious political ramifications. As the Miami Herald has reported, "[t]he U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, was personally involved in the negotiations" back in and around 2008. Id. Ex. C. Acosta subsequently became "a member of President Donald Trump's cabinet" and currently serves as the Secretary of Labor. Id. Since the Miami Herald published its expose, some members of Congress have demanded an investigation into what led to the slap-on-the-wrist punishment for Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g., Anthony Man, Florida Democrats want investigation into Trump cabinet member's role in handling Epstein case, SOUTH FLORIDA SUN SENTINEL. (Dec. 4, 2018) available at 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016494

https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-ne-jeffrey-epstein-alex-acosta-investigation- 20181204-story.html. The Post has also persisted with its own investigation into whether the Manhattan District Attorney's Office was unduly lenient when it advocated in favor of registering Epstein as a level one sex offender. On December 1, 2018, the Post published an article entitled "Manhattan DA sided with pedophile billionaire after botching investigation." Id. Ex. C. Following up on its prior reporting, the Post reported Justice Pickholz's denial of ADA Gaffney's efforts to register Epstein as a level one offender and then asked the District Attorney's Office to account for the "mishandling of the Epstein hearing." Id. In response to questions from the Post, the District Attorney's Office insisted that ADA Gaffney simply "made a mistake." Id. A spokesman also claimed that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance "was not aware of the hearing until years later and had nothing to do with it." Id. But, as the Post also reported, "IsJome law enforcement sources don't believe Vance had no clue that his office had a sex-offender case involving a Manhattan mogul with close ties to Democrats." Id. Unsealing of the First Department appeal briefs in this case is crucial so that the public and the press may more fully understand why Epstein was initially offered level one offender status despite the overwhelming evidence that he was a serial sexual abuser of children. D. The Post's Efforts to Obtain the Appellate Briefing Filed with the First Department On December 4, 2018, Post reporter Sue Edelman contacted the Director of Communications for District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. and requested a copy of the appellate brief filed by the District Attorney's Office. Id. 99 6-8. In making this request, Edelman specifically stated that the District Attorney's Office could redact the names of any victims of sexual abuse before forwarding the brief. Id. Edelman's request was denied, however, because the District Attorney's Office has taken the position that the brief was filed under seal in its 4811-3721-9459v 3 3930033-000039 8 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016495

entirety pursuant to N.Y. Civil Rights Law section 50-b and could not be released - even with the names of victims redacted - without an order from this Court. Id. Nonetheless, the District Attorney's Office stated in an email that it would "not oppose" the Post's motion requesting that a redacted brief be produced. Id. Ex. D. Counsel for the Post also contacted counsel for Epstein to ascertain his position on the disclosure of the appellate briefs. Id. On December 20, 2018, Mr. Epstein's lawyer stated that he would not take a position until he had an opportunity to review the brief and reserved his right to oppose. Counsel for Epstein later informed counsel for the Post that "after consideration of your request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain identities, we take no position on behalf of Mr. Epstein." Id. Ex. F. On December 21, 2019, the Post moved this Court for an order unsealing the appellate briefs and directing the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to produce copies of the briefs with the names of victims redacted (the "December 21 Motion"). On January 2, 2019, counsel for the Post received an affirmation signed by Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo, dated December 28, 2018, which opposed the December 21 Motion. After telling the Post that it "will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief," the District Attorney's Office argued that the December 21 Motion should be denied on two grounds. First, the District Attorney's office faulted the Post for supposedly failing to "furnish the requisite notice" to "the prosecuting agencies for defendant's underlying sex crimes," as required by section 50-b of the New York Civil Rights Act. Id. Ex. E 92. According to the Manhattan District Attorney, the Post should have notified "the federal and local prosecutor's offices in Florida, where defendant was charged" (and presumably not the Manhattan District Attorney's Office).! ' The Post firmly disputes the District Attorney's contention - which is not supported by any authority - that section 50-b requires the Post to serve any prosecutor who touched Epstein's case in Florida in order to unseal documents 9 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016496

Second, Assistant District Attorney Friedman Agnifilo objected to unsealing any portion of the appellate briefs and wrote that "we cannot agree ... even to a production of the people's brief with redactions of the names or initials of Epstein's victims." Id. 93. She further noted, however, that "if this Court is inclined to grant the Post's motion, we would not oppose producing a copy of the People's brief, with substantial redactions necessary to protect the identities of the victims but keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural history of the SORA hearing." Id. Although the Post does not agree that section 50-b requires it to notify Florida prosecutors of its intention to move this Court to unseal briefs filed by the Manhattan District Attorney in a New York sex offenders proceeding, it nonetheless voluntarily withdrew the December 21 Motion on January 4, 2019 to moot the issue and bypass an easily avoidable procedural dispute. Counsel for the Post has contacted the Palm Beach State Attorney's office and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (collectively, the "Florida Prosecutors") to apprise them of its intention to refile this motion to unseal the appellate briefs with the names of victims redacted. Id. T9 17-18. The Post will also serve the Florida Prosecutors with copies of this motion. Having mooted the procedural objection raised by the Manhattan District Attorney, the Post now refiles its motion respectfully requesting an order unsealing the appellate briefs and directing the District Attorney's Office to provide the Post with copies - with the names of victims redacted - within seven days of the entry of its order. filed by New York prosecutors in a New York court as part of proceedings to register Epstein as a sex-offender in roceedings against Epstein in this State - and there is no question that the Post provided the Manhattan Distri torney with adequate notice of the December 21 Motio 10 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016497

ARGUMENT Despite the Manhattan District Attorney's apparent opposition to releasing any of portion of the appellate briefs, good cause exists to unseal briefs with victims' names redacted because the handling of Epstein's designation as a sex offender by New York prosecutors - including the appellate arguments regarding that designation - are of paramount public concern and should be open to public scrutiny. I. THE POST HAS THE RIGHT TO MOVE THIS COURT FOR AN ORDER UNSEALING THE APPELLATE BRIEFING As a threshold matter, the Practice Rules of this Court permit non-parties (like the Post) to submit "[a]pplications for sealing and unsealing documents ... by motion." 22 NYCRR § 1250.1(e)(3). The Post's right to petition this Court for an order unsealing the appellate briefs is further buttressed by the rule that "affected members of the media should be given the opportunity to be heard" before a Court takes the drastic step of sealing court proceedings, filings or dockets. In re Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v. Moynihan, 125 A.D.2d 34, 38, 512 N.Y.S.2d 266, 269 (3d Dep't 1987), aff'd on other grounds, 71 N.Y.2d 263, 525 N. Y.S.2d 24 (1988). See also Mancheski v. Gabelli Grp. Capital Partners, 39 A.D.3d 499, 501, 835 N. Y.S.2d 595, 597 (2d Dep't 2007) ("[P]rior to issuance of an order to seal judicial documents, the court is obligated, where possible, to afford news media an opportunity to be heard.") (citing In re Herald Co. v. Weisenberg, 59 N.Y.2d 378, 383, 465 N. Y.S.2d 862, 864 (1983)); Maxim, Inc. v. Feifer, 145 A.D.3d 516, 43 N.Y.S.3d 313 (1st Dep't 2016) (reversing order denying motion of press entities to intervene for purpose of seeking access to filed motion papers and other court records). In addition to guaranteeing the Post's right to move this Court to unseal documents, New York law also requires this Court to make "specific findings to support its determination" before 11 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016498

limiting public access to judicial records or proceedings. Daily News, L.P. v. Wiley, 126 A.D.3d 511,515, 6 N. Y.S.3d 19, 24 (1st Dep't 2015) (before sealing records, courts "must adhere strictly to the procedures set forth in the controlling case law including affording a full opportunity by any interested members of the press to be heard, and making specific findings to support its determination... [T]rial court[s] ... cannot ... seal evidence and transcripts merely because the parties are consenting to same and the case has obtained notoriety."). Therefore, in the unlikely event that this Court declines to grant the Post's motion to unseal, either in part or in toto, the Post respectfully requests that this Court issue a written order setting forth the grounds for its decision. GOOD CAUSE EXISTS TO UNSEAL THE APPELLATE BRIEFS The appellate briefs should be disclosed because they are highly relevant to the public's understanding of whether the Office of the Manhattan District Attorney - whose fundamental mission is to protect the people of this State - initially showed undue deference to a dangerous pedophile, who is unusually rich and well-connected. New York Civil Rights Law section 50-b permits courts to disclose court documents relating to the commission of a sexual offense whenever a showing is made that "good cause exists for disclosure." N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b. See also 22 NYCCR § 1250.1(e)(3) (permitting the "unsealing [of] court records ... upon good cause shown"). Good cause clearly exists for disclosing the appellate briefs because they contain a full explanation for why the District Attorney's Office argued before the lower court that Epstein should be registered as a level one sex offender before changing position on appeal. See Epstein, 89 A.D. at 571, 933 N. Y.S.2d at 241. The appellate briefs may also shed light on the extent of "the evidence... that [Epstein] committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls," which the District 12 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016499

Attorney's Office apparently disregarded or was not aware of in the proceedings before the lower court. Id. Not only are the appellate briefs subject to the strong presumption of openness that applies to all judicial documents but there is also an intense public interest in disclosing these specific documents because they will shed light on why the District Attorney's Office initially took the controversial decision to argue in favor of lenient treatment of Epstein.? As Justice Burger wrote, "Ip]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing." Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980). "Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people...." N.Y. Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971) (Black, J. concurring). In short, the appellate briefs should be unsealed so that the Post can inform the public about the decisions taken by the District Attorney's Office with respect to Epstein so that the public can decide whether there was anything careless or improper about those decisions. The need for transparency and public understanding of why the District Attorney's Office handled the Epstein case the way it did is heightened by the fact that District Attorney Vance has faced criticism over claims that his office gives favorable treatment to rich and powerful men 2 The presumption of openness is grounded in the U.S. and New York Constitutions as well as deeply-entrenched common law rules that govern this Court. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 8 of the New York State Constitution both recognize the presumptive right of the public and press to access and inspect court records. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986); Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); In re Associated Press v. Bell, 70 N.Y.2d 32, 517 N.Y.S.2d 444 (1987). In addition to being well established under the federal and state constitutions, the right of access to court records is also firmly grounded in common law principles." Danco Labs., Lid. v. Chem. Works of Gideon Richter, Ltd., 274 A.D.2d 1, 6, 711 N. Y.S.2d 419, 423 (1st Dep't 2000) (citing inter alia Nixon v. Warner Commo'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978)). See also People v. Burton, 189 A.D.2d 532, 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d 488, 491-92 (3d Dep't 1993) ("a common-law presumption" favors public access to court records); In re Application of National Broad. Co., 635 F.2d 945, 949 (2d Cir. 1980) ("[T]he common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is beyond dispute.") (citation omitted). 13 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016500

accused of sexual abuse. As the New Yorker reported, DA Vance declined to charge Harvey Weinstein with a sex crime in 2015 even though investigators collected ample evidence that he had groped an actress without consent. See Jennie Suk Gersen, Why Didn't the Manhattan DA Prosecute the Trumps or Harvey Weinstein, NEw YOrKEr (Oct. 13, 2017) available at https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-didnt-manhattan-da-cyrus-vance-prosecute- the-trumps-or-harvey-weinstein. Even after the emergence of the #Me Too movement and the indictment of Harvey Weinstein on rape charges, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office has continued to face criticism for failing to prosecute the Weinstein case aggressively enough. Id. District Attorney Vance is an elected official who wields an immense amount of discretion over prosecutions. The people of New York have the right to scrutinize how his office treated this case involving a rich and well-connected sex offender, especially in light of allegations that other notable sexual predators have benefitted from the apparent deference of prosecutors. To put it bluntly, the appellate briefs should be released immediately to avoid any impression of impropriety caused by continued secrecy. There is also a strong interest in disclosing the appellate briefs to enable the public to review for itself the arguments that led this Court to issue the Decision affirming Epstein's status as a level three sex offender. By ensuring public access to the courts and enabling public discussion of the functioning of the judiciary, the news media help "the public to participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial process - an essential component in our structure of self- government." Globe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 606. As courts have recognized time and again, "[w]ithout access to the proceedings, the public cannot analyze and critique the reasoning of the court." Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. FTC, 710 F.2d 1165, 1178 (6th Cir. 1983). Thus, "[o]penness ... enhances both the basic fairness of [a] trial and the appearance of fairness 14 4811-3721-9459v 3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016501

so essential to public confidence in the system." Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 508 (1984) (citing Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 569-71). For this reason, the appellate briefs should be unsealed so that the public has the benefit of seeing the very statements and arguments that formed the basis of this Court's Decision. It is especially important to provide a transparent view into these judicial proceedings because suspicions have already been raised about how the District Attorney's Office handled Epstein's case. When, as here, "issues of major public importance are involved, the interests of the public as well as the press in access to court records "weigh heavily' in favor of release." Danco, 274 A.D.2d at 8, 711 N.Y.S.2d at 425 (citation omitted). This constitutional presumption of open access to court records requires "the most compelling circumstances" to justify any restriction upon that right. In re Application of Nat'l Broad. Co., 635 F.2d at 952. Here, it is impossible to conceive of any circumstances that might justify wholesale sealing of relevant court documents that are necessary to understand how prosecutors and this Court handled a matter of such intense public concern. The interest of Epstein's victims to remain anonymous can be satisfied by directing the District Attorney's Office to redact the names of victims before disclosing the appellate briefs. To be clear, the Post has no interest in identifying victims of sexual assault who wish to remain anonymous. It does, however, have a right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney abruptly changed position after initially arguing that Epstein should be treated leniently. The District Attorney's Office has indicated that it "would not oppose producing a copy of the People's brief... keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural history of the SORA hearing, the portion of the brief that is seemingly of interest to the Post." Browning Aff. Ex. E. With all due respect to the District Attorney, the Post is simply not in a position to 15 4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016502

evaluate whether the proposed redactions are reasonable. Because the Post cannot review any part of the briefs, it is impossible for the Post to know whether the information it seeks is in the procedural history section of the People's brief or in other parts of the briefing filed in the Appeal. Moreover, courts must order narrow redactions where possible to avoid overbroad sealing. See, e.g., Burton, 189 A.D.2d at 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d at 491 (requiring courts to "consider less drastic alternatives to sealing the records which would adequately serve the competing interests"); Maxim, Inc., 145 A.D.3d at 518, 43 N. Y.S.3d at 316 ("We recognize that it may be easier for the parties and the motion court to seal an entire court record, rather than make a determination on a document by document basis about sealing, but administrative convenience is not a compelling reason to justify sealing."). In keeping with this State's strong preference against wholesale sealing of documents, section 50-b expressly permits this Court to release judicial documents after ordering redactions "as it deems necessary .... to preserve the confidentiality of the identity of the victim." N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b. Since the only information protected by the statute is identity of Epstein's victims, the Post respectfully requests an order directing the District Attorney to redact only the names of Epstein's victims. Since the Post does not seek the names of victims of sexual abuse and agrees that these names should be redacted before the appellate briefs are disclosed, there should be no need under the statute to provide notice "to the victim or other person legally responsible for the care of the victim." N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b(2). But to the extent such notice is necessary, the Post is unable to notify any of the victims on its own because it has no knowledge of which victims (if any) may be identified in the requested documents. If the statute requires victims to be notified 3 Without the benefit of reviewing the appellate briefs, the Post is not in a position to evaluate whether the briefs contain other information that might identify Epstein's victims, such as home addresses. While the Post would not object to the District Attorney's Office making good faith redactions of genuinely identifying information, these redactions should be narrowly tailored and no more expansive than is necessary to protect the victims' identities. 16 4811-3721-9459 3 3930033-000039 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016503

even if their names will not be disclosed, the Post respectfully submits that either the Manhattan District Attorney or the Florida Prosecutors should provide notice promptly. To require the Post to notify victims itself - without any ability to discover who those victims are - would be an absurd result that defeats the purpose of the unsealing provision of section 50-b, which allows "any person" to file an application requesting that information be unsealed for "good cause."* In sum, the strong presumption of openness that governs New York courts compels the conclusion that the appellate briefs in this action must be unsealed (with the names of any victims of a sexual offense redacted). CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, the Post respectfully requests an order unsealing the appellate briefs, which directs the District Attorney to provide counsel for the Post with copies of these documents, with the names of victims redacted, within seven days of the issuance of this Court's unsealing order.

Article: Criminal Enforcement Redundancy: Oversight of Decisions Not to Prosecute December, 2018 Reporter 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844 * Length: 23570 words Author: Darryl K. Brown* + O. M. Vicars Professor of Law and Barron F. Black Research Professor of Law, University of Virginia School of Law. Copyright © 2018 by Darryl K. Brown. Text [*844] INTRODUCTION In light of concerns about mass incarceration and excessive search practices by police, ' underenforcement of criminal law is not the first problem that springs to mind for American criminal justice. But in fact, some of the prominent contemporary complaints about U.S. criminal justice, as well as some longstanding ones, object to underenforcement of criminal law. Two of the most notable categories are failures to prosecute in cases of unjustified police violence, especially against nonwhite victims, and in cases of sexual assaults. Lower-profile examples abound as well, as do historical examples. Given the nation's history, underenforcement problems are often related to race. Insufficient law enforcement attention to crimes in minority neighborhoods, for example, has been criticized as depriving African American victims and communities of their fair share of government protection from criminal harm. 2 In earlier eras, law enforcement inattention to, or wholesale neglect [*845] of, white offenders' victimization of black victims - in lynchings, attacks on civil right activists, sexual assaults, and other contexts - was often patent. 3 But the problem of unjustified underenforcement is not confined to these contexts, nor to the United States. Failures to prosecute arise from a fundamental structural challenge faced by all criminal justice systems: how to ensure unbiased, evenhanded enforcement practices - safeguards in favor of justified enforcement. This challenge gets less attention than criminal procedure's central preoccupation of guarding against excessive or groundless criminal charges. Concern about misuse of the state's prosecution authority rightly motivates much in criminal procedure, from search and seizure rules 4 and judicial review of arrests 5 to evidence disclosure duties, 6 the right to counsel, ' and standards of proof. 8 • U.S. incarceration rates quintupled over the last forty years and are five to seven times higher than those in other advanced democracies. See Floyd v. City of New York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 540, 572-602 (S.D.N. Y. 2013) (documenting and holding unconstitutional widespread stop- and-frisk practices by New York City police that disproportionately targeted non-white men); Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness 6-9 (2010); World Prison Brief Data, Inst. for Crim.

LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure 126-63, 512-49 (5th ed. 2009) (discussing search and seizure rules). DAVID SCHOEN HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016510

Page 2 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *845 Structural responses to the state declining to use its enforcement authority are much fewer and less prominent. At least in common law countries, enforcement decisions are the province of police and prosecutor discretion, and oversight of officials' failures to enforce has been left almost wholly to the political process. Decisions to search, arrest, or charge face modest judicial scrutiny on evidentiary grounds and - at the extreme margins - racial or [*846] ethnic bias. ° Decisions not to arrest or charge are virtually immune from judicial review or other nonpolitical oversight. 1° Like other common law jurisdictions, U.S. justice systems have always rejected an approach long adopted in some civil law jurisdictions to prevent unjustified and disparate nonenforcement - a rule of mandatory prosecution that restricts executive officials' discretion over arrest and charging decisions. 11 A broader view, however, reveals that all criminal justice systems incorporate one or more strategies to address underenforcement, which can be collectively described as redundant charging authority. All are to some degree familiar, though they are not usually described in these terms or understood as serving this common purpose. One approach is creation of two distinct enforcement agencies with overlapping or duplicative jurisdiction. This model is a familiar safeguard against underenforcement of transnational crimes or crimes on the high seas; international criminal law routinely grants nation-states coextensive, duplicative jurisdiction to enforce international or domestic criminal laws outside their borders. International treaties on subjects such as public corruption, drug trafficking, and human trafficking 12 can be understood as agreements to create enforcement redundancy among national criminal justice agencies to solve underenforcement problems by particular states. 13 The same arrangement occurs domestically for enforcement of civil or regulatory law when administrative agencies have overlapping, and thus redundant, [*847] jurisdiction over the same regulated activities. 14 The most important version of this model in the United States, however, is criminal justice federalism. Due to the steady growth of federal criminal law, jurisdiction, and institutional capacity over the last century, state and federal 5 Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111-16 (1975) (holding that the Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause prior to extended detention; County of Riverside v.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 86 (1963) (holding prosecution's withholding of the confession of defendant's confederate violated defendant's due process rights). - Gideon v.

United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813(1996) (holding that, in assessing the legality of police decisions to stop suspects under the Fourth Amendment, courts should ignore officers' subjective motivations). 10 See, e.g., Abby L. Dennis, Reining in the Minister of Justice: Prosecutorial Oversight and the Superseder Power, 57 Duke L.J. 131, 132-33 (2007) (describing prosecutors' "limitless, unmonitored and ... unreviewable power"). 11 See infra Part II.B. 12 See Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, G.A.

Page 3 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *847 law enforcement substantially overlap for many categories of crime. Much of this enforcement redundancy, as considered in detail below, has been a deliberate federal response to diverse problems of underenforcement in state criminal justice. The point for now, however, is the functional equivalence of duplicative federal-state jurisdiction, nation-state jurisdiction, and agency jurisdiction. All represent a common strategy to reduce underenforcement by empowering redundant enforcement authorities: independent entities with equivalent institutional capacity and expertise share jurisdiction. If one neglects to enforce, the other may. Functionally, each backstops, or provides oversight of, failures to enforce by the other. A second model for minimizing unjustified failures to prosecute relies on private actors to create redundancy with public prosecutors' authority. Empowering private actors to file and litigate public law claims is familiar in many civil law contexts; numerous federal statutes authorize private rights of action that enable private individuals or groups to supplement public agencies' law enforcement efforts. 15 Through much of the nineteenth century, this kind of duplicative public-private enforcement authority was a familiar feature in the criminal justice systems of many states, which permitted private parties - victims - to prosecute alleged criminal wrongdoing. Redundant charging authority takes other forms as well. In large hierarchical agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice, internal administrative review of front-line prosecutors' charging or declination decisions by higher-ups creates a version of redundant enforcement authority; supervisors can make independent determinations and reverse front-line prosecutors. 16 [*848] This kind of redundancy through administrative review now exists in English, Irish, and many European criminal justice systems. 17 More ambitiously from a U.S. perspective - because it is rare here - judicial power to review prosecutorial charging decisions is another means to create some degree of redundant charging authority between the executive and judicial branches. Although criminal charging is a core function of the executive branch, state and federal courts have modest authority to review and bar executive officials' decisions to file criminal charges. It is only as a matter of policy that courts - with a few exceptions - are not empowered to address underenforcement by reviewing the executive's noncharging decisions. (This power is somewhat broader for courts in England and Wales as well as in the law of a few states.) 18 This model of redundancy separates charging authority - for courts as for Department of Justice supervisors, the power to order prosecutors to prosecute - from enforcement authority, which includes the institutional capacity to file and litigate charges. Courts (with rare exceptions) have no administrative capacity to litigate a prosecution; but they could provide some redundancy in charging authority. 19 In sum, charging redundancy can occur between equivalent agencies in separate governments, between public and private actors, or between agencies or branches of the same government. Criminal justice systems in Europe and the common law world have adopted or strengthened one or more of these mechanisms in recent decades. In the United States, choices among these strategies have changed over time and between jurisdictions. Nearly all states that once authorized private prosecution have long since prohibited it. Federal prosecutors are organized in a centralized hierarchical agency that makes administrative review possible, but few state prosecutors are similarly organized. For these reasons and others, the primary means of enforcement redundancy to combat underenforcement is overlapping federal- 1*849] state authority made possible by the distinctive U.S. model of federalism. 15 Examples of federal statutes authorizing private rights of action include the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15 (2006) (granting a private right of action for antitrust violations); Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h) (1994); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-5(f) (1994); Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (1994). For an overview, see Pamela H. Bucy, Private Justice, 76 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 12-54 (2002). 16 See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(f) (2012) (mandating review of federal prosecutor decisions within the Justice Department upon victim's request). 17 See infra Part II.A.1. 18 See infra Parts II.B.3-B.4. 19 Note that this conception of redundant authority intersects with, but is distinct from, constitutional separation of powers. In a standard account (briefly put), separation of powers describes branches of government having distinct roles, authority, and competencies. In the main, branches do not do the same things; they do different, rival, and complementary things. But if so empowered by the legislature, courts can exercise some degree of charging authority, creating limited redundancy in charging authority between the executive and judicial branches.

Page 4 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *849 This Article has several aims. One is to introduce the concept of enforcement redundancy and demonstrate its utility. Another is to highlight problems of criminal law underenforcement and to situate contemporary complaints about failures to prosecute police violence and sexual assaults as specific examples of broader enforcement deficiencies that stem from bias and favoritism in police and prosecutorial discretion. The Article also defends the observation that enforcement redundancy strategies are responses to versions of this problem. It then assesses the strengths and weaknesses of different such strategies, with primary attention on the effectiveness of the U.S. approach of redundant federal-state authority. A focus on three different categories of criminal law underenforcement - government corruption, police violence, and sexual assaults - clarifies differences in the effectiveness of the U.S. approach. Federalism has proven an effective response to states' failures to address forms of public corruption, and for those crimes, it is likely superior to its alternatives. Federal authority has had some success in compensating for states' failures to prosecute police violence and other police wrongdoing, but its efficacy is harder to judge and arguments for supplemental redundancy strategies are stronger. For sexual assaults, federal authority has failed to assert any meaningful enforcement jurisdiction to compensate for weaknesses in state justice systems. Despite the sustained efforts and notable successes of reform advocates in this area, no model of enforcement redundancy has made inroads. The Article proceeds as follows. Part II briefly surveys evidence of and reasons for underenforcement. The need for safeguards against unjustified nonenforcement has long been recognized in the United States and elsewhere; outside the United States, as part of victims' rights reforms, it has been the object of institutional reforms. Part III elaborates the mechanisms available to address risks of criminal law underenforcement. The predominant options are (1) some authority for private actors to initiate or participate in criminal prosecutions; (2) judicial or administrative review of initial nonprosecution decisions by public prosecutors; and (3) authority for a separate, independent public prosecutor's office to bring charges when another prosecutor has declined to. Other countries - out of tradition, an absence of federalism, or as part of victims' rights reforms - rely on versions of [*850] the first and second options. Part III also considers why U.S. victims' rights laws, which are otherwise robust, lack either of these components adopted elsewhere, especially given that many state criminal justice systems relied on private prosecution for much of the nineteenth century. The likely answers help explain why the United States relies almost exclusively on the third option as a safeguard against underenforcement. Finally, Part IV assesses how effectively federalism-based enforcement redundancy addresses underenforcement, particularly the recurrent, contemporary controversies around police violence and sexual assault. Redundant enforcement through overlapping federalism has had considerable success addressing some underenforcement problems, such as corruption by state and local officials, certain kinds of civil rights violations, or crimes against disfavored minority groups. 20 It is doubtful that private prosecution or judicial review could match its success. The federalism strategy has a more mixed record on the problem of unjustified police violence. Federal officials have succeeded where state officials have failed in overseeing reform of local police departments to reduce police lawbreaking, and they occasionally prosecute and convict individual officers. 21 But the vast majority of incidents of police violence go unprosecuted, including most that lead to large civil settlements for victims. 22 20 See, e.g., David Grann, Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI 57 (2017) (describing "corrupt sheriffs and police departments" that failed to enforce the law and were unable to solve serial murders of Native American victims); Margaret Burnham, The Long Civil Rights Act and Criminal Justice, 25 B.U.

DAVID SCHOEN HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016513

Page 5 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *850 It is [*851] unclear what portion of those incidents merit criminal prosecution. Key facts are often disputed, and while federal and state jurisdiction are coextensive here, federal criminal law generally sets a higher bar for liability than state law, especially due to its more onerous mens rea requirement. 23 That makes the former an imperfect backstop to the latter, because they are only partially redundant. And as recent changes in federal policy suggest, 24 redundancy between governments is subject to political shifts in those governments; federal oversight of state enforcement works only if federal officials are committed to the oversight role. Moreover, keeping prosecution in the exclusive province of executive officials keeps prosecutorial discretion more closely aligned with political majorities and thereby with popular sentiments about certain groups of defendants (such as police officers) and victim groups (such as criminal suspects). In this context, redundancy in state law charging by courts or private actors, rather than rival prosecutors, might make a real contribution. Finally, cases of sexual assault reveal a weakness of federalism-based redundancy, State and federal criminal jurisdiction in the United States overlap more than elsewhere, but they are not wholly coextensive. Federal prosecutors lack authority over most assaults that do not involve public officials or federal [*852] property. Sexual assaults are one context in which the enforcement strategies favored in Europe and England - regulated private prosecution or review of declination decisions - hold more promise. I. UNDERENFORCEMENT AND REASONS NOT TO PROSECUTE A. Sources of Unjustified Noncharging Decisions Public prosecutors are the gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement, and justice systems employ a variety of safeguards against prosecutors' misjudgment, bias, incompetence, or laziness. Most are directed at prosecutors' charging decisions rather than decisions declining to charge (i.e., declination decisions), for familiar reasons - charging creates real burdens and risks for defendants. 25 Many familiar procedural components are aimed at preventing improper criminal charges or the harm they can cause. Requirements that charges are based on sufficient evidence are an obvious example, but double jeopardy laws and restrictions on prosecutors' conflicts of interest serve the same purpose. The full range of pretrial and trial procedures designed to assure accurate and unbiased adjudication are intended to sort out improper charges and attach punishments only to proper Safeguards against nonenforcement, or unjustified decisions not to prosecute, are fewer, are less explicit, and (in common law jurisdictions) are less often in the form of legal rules and mandates. One explanation for this is simply that the interests at stake are not as high - no individual faces prosecution and possible punishment. Another is that many non-prosecution decisions 23 Police violence is often prosecuted under I8 U.S.C. § 242 (2012) (criminalizing the deprivation of rights under color of law).

DAVID SCHOEN HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016514

Page 6 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *852 follow from determinations that there is insufficient evidence to support charging, and common law jurisdictions [*853] have long left those assessments in the unregulated discretion of police and prosecutors. But that is not the whole story. For one, it does not follow from the fact that officials must assess evidentiary sufficiency that their assessments should be unregulated or unsupervised. The tradition in civil law jurisdictions is otherwise, and available evidence often depends on the effort and priority officials give to finding it. More importantly, how rigorously we guard against unmerited nonenforcement depends on how we value the interests harmed by nonenforcement, and on how much we worry about nonenforcement for the wrong reasons. Both have changed over time. The primary causes of underenforcement are failing to investigate and charge due to biases against certain victims or harms, or favoritism toward certain kinds of suspects. 28 Three kinds of crimes - local government corruption, sexual assaults, and unjustified uses of force by law enforcement officers - illustrate the link between these risks, failures to enforce, and the consequences of underenforcement. Local corruption garners the least public and political attention now; 29 not coincidentally, the United States has found an effective model of enforcement redundancy on this front. 30 The justice system's responses to sexual assault and police violence, on the other hand, are subjects of heated political and policy debates. 31 There has been notable progress in reducing the criminal justice system's disregard of [*854] both kinds of offenses, but underenforcement - and almost as important, widespread suspicion of underenforcement - remain significant enough that they illustrate some of the key costs of those failures. Suspicion of underenforcement is itself a cost, because it reflects a loss of legitimacy for criminal justice institutions. That loss in turn undermines the system's efficacy if citizens decline to report victimization or otherwise decline to cooperate with law enforcement officials. Evidence for those effects is strong for both sexual assaults and police violence. 32 More generally, underenforcement is a form of unequal treatment that unevenly - and unjustly - distributes the important public benefits of criminal law enforcement, including the state's commitment to protect everyone equally from unlawful harms. 33 It also deprives victims of the private benefits that criminal justice is now widely recognized to afford, and owe, to victims. 27 See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 727-28 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("Law enforcement is not automatic .... What every prosecutor is practically required to do is to select the cases for prosecution and to select those in which the offense is the most flagrant, the public harm the greatest, and the proof the most certain." (quoting Robert H. Jackson, Attorney Gen. of the U.S., Address to the Second Annual Conference of United States Attorneys: The Federal Prosecutor (Apr. 1, 1940))); 483 Parl Deb HC (5th ser.) (1951) col. 681 (UK) ('It has never been the rule ... that suspected criminal offences must automatically be the subject of prosecution."). 28 See Alexandra Natapoff, Underenforcement, 75 Fordham I. Rev. 1715, 1722-39 (2006) (documenting underenforcement as a significant problem). On underenforcement of sexual assault offenses, see Deborah Tuerkheimer, Underenforcement as Unequal Protection, 57 B.C. L. Rev. 1287, 1292-1303 (2016) (discussing empirical evidence of bias leading to underenforcement). 29 Concern about public corruption at the federal government level, by contrast, has increased, precisely where criminal and regulatory level are somewhat weaker. See, e.g., Zephyr Teachout, Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin's Snuff Box to Citizens United 1-16 30 See infra Part III.B.1. 31 See, e.g., Do Police Use Deadly Force Too Often?, N.Y.

Davis, Arbitrary Justice: The Power of the American Prosecutor 166 (2007) (noting that prosecutorial discretion can unintentionally "produce inequitable results for similarly situated DAVID SCHOEN HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016515

Page 7 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *854 1. Underenforcement Against Corruption Crimes of corruption by state and local officials are a good example of harms that, at times, criminal justice systems have unduly ignored. 34 Local police and prosecutors are not institutionally well-situated to pursue and evaluate those crimes. They often have professional, if not personal, ties to other local officials, which heightens the risk of undue favoritism or judgments that are otherwise not fully disinterested. That is the main reason [*855] that federal investigators and prosecutors have state and local corruption in their portfolios. 35 2. Underenforcement Against Sexual Assault Sexual assault offenses are another context in which underenforcement is now widely recognized, but the causes are different. Rather than favoritism toward offenders, the problem seems to be bias against the type of offense, and, in varying degrees, against the victims. Failures of police to rigorously pursue allegations of sexual assaults have been widely documented. Among the explanations that advocates, attorneys and some scholars point to are "the entrenched nature of long-recognized, gender-driven biases by police against domestic violence or sexual assault claims" and "against individuals from particular groups or under particular circumstances," especially against victims who are poor or are racial, ethnic or gender minorities. 37 One large-scale empirical study of why rape-kit evidence remained untested, for example, suggested that the explanation in part was "negative beliefs and stereotypes about victims, which adversely affected the quality of the investigation." 38 It bears noting that much of this bias is understood to be subtle or unconscious patterns built on cultural norms, rather than conscious, purposeful disfavor. 39 But when evidentiary records are incomplete or ambiguous, their effects are substantial. 1*856] 3. Underenforcement Against Police Excessive Uses of Force Failures to prosecute in the wake of police shootings and other possibly excessive uses of force against civilians are scenarios that raise suspicions of both bias against victims, many of whom are black men (and often criminal suspects, another disfavored victims and defendants"); Natapoff, supra note 28, at 1753; David Alan Sklansky, Police and Democracy, 103 Mich. L. Rev. 1699, 1822 (2005) (arguing that policing failures in some communities undercuts "the egalitarian project of protecting all citizens from private violence"). 34 The point extends to private actors, especially organized crime, with ties to local officials. 35 See infra Part III.B.1. On local corruption, see generally, for example, Corruption and American Cities: Essays and Case Studies in Ethical Accountability (Joaquin Jay Gonzalez III &? Roger L. Kemp eds., 2016) (discussing the role of corruption in American cities); James L. Merriner, Grafters and Goo Goos: Corruption and Reform in Chicago, 1833-2003 (2004) (discussing the role of corruption in Chicago). 36 See Tuerkheimer, supra note 28, at 1292-99. 37 ACLU, Responses from the Field: Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, and Policing 40 (2015); see also Tuerkheimer, supra note 28, at 1292-99 (citing a range of studies to conclude that "in many jurisdictions, the widespread perception that law enforcement officers will likely not pursue allegations of rape [due to race, class or gender bias] is entirely accurate"). 38 Rebecca Campbell et al., The Detroit Sexual Assault Kit (SAK) Action Research Project (ARP), Final Report 109(2015). 39 Davis, supra note 33, at 23-34; Tuerkheimer, supra note 28 (discussing bias in sexual assault prosecutions); cf.

Page 8 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *856 group), and favoritism toward the class of perpetrators, law enforcement officers. 40 In the ordinary organization of criminal justice systems, those cases call on officials from one law enforcement agency to assess the evidence against officials from another, even when the agencies regularly work together. 41 As in the context of local public corruption, conflict-of-interest 42 are far from adequate to prevent prosecutors from making judgments in light of such professional relationships and 43 The possibility of partiality is inevitable. When [*857] that possibility combines with the long history of racial disparities in U.S. criminal justice administration, widespread suspicion of non-prosecution decisions in cases of police violence against minority civilians is hardly surprising, as the Black Lives Matter movement demonstrates. 4. Other Underenforcement Contexts Corruption, sexual assaults, and police violence illustrate the key causes and effects of failures to enforce criminal law, but the same forces are recognizably at work in other social contexts. Scholars and advocates have pointed to biases as explanations for inadequate law enforcement responses to offenses against undocumented aliens, sex workers, institutionalized persons, and targets of anti-LGBT hate crimes. 45 Complaints that police ignored wrongdoing against racial-minority victims in minority communities were prominent in the 1970s and 1980s. 46 Some of [*858] the remedies, however - which included harsher drug laws adopted with substantial support from African American politicians and communities - have proven deeply problematic for those same communities. 47 Finally, less pernicious biases and favoritism are suspected explanations for lenient enforcement patterns in lower-visibility contexts, such as bicyclists killed by motor vehicle drivers, 48 employees injured on the job due to workplace safety violations, and bystanders shot by recreational hunters. 49 Even critics of those enforcement decisions in those settings view them as products of subtle or unconscious empathy with vehicle drivers, employers, and recreational gun users, which incline officials 40 Prison guard assaults on inmates raise the same concerns, although they get less public attention. For a notorious failure to prosecute prison guards and law enforcement officials for unjustified lethal force, see generally Heather Ann Thompson, Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy (2016). 41 Cf. Paul Cassell, Who Prosecutes the Police? Perceptions of Bias in Police Misconduct Investigations and a Possible Remedy, Wash.

One solution, followed in Wisconsin, is to assign investigation of deaths involving law enforcement officers to a state-level investigative agency unconnected to the local agency of the officer under investigation.

Page 9 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *858 to assess conduct as non-negligent rather than reckless. 50 Yet even those relatively benign affinities can lead to sub-optimal enforcement policies that might benefit from redundant evaluation of charging decisions. B. Other Contributions to Underenforcement It is worth noting that prosecutors themselves might not share those biases so much as take account of them in a local community and jury pool. Expecting juries will be unreceptive to a case is one reason that some prosecutors cite for not charging in some cases. There is evidence for this with regard to hate [*859] crimes against LGBT victim groups, for 51 and the difficulty prosecutors have faced in convicting police officer defendants is a well-recognized hurdle in police violence cases. 52 The same considerations can cut against prosecutions when victims are undocumented immigrants, sex workers, prisoners, and suspects in custody. 53 Redundant enforcement authority can do less to redress this barrier, although depending on its form, it is not powerless. A separate prosecuting authority might bring better investigation and fact development, or different jurisdictional rules that change the composition of jury venires. Inadequate funding for criminal justice agencies can also play a role in aggravating areas of unjustified underenforcement. Lack of public resources is an accepted (and inevitable) justification for declining to prosecute in some cases where evidence is sufficient to prove guilt. 55 But funding constraints are [*860] not an affirmative good on par with other policy-based, public- interest justifications for non-prosecution, such as judgments finding that civil, regulatory, or public-health remedies are preferable to criminal sanctions, or concluding that third-party harms outweigh prosecution's benefits. 56 Resource constraints are a problem justice systems would like to minimize. Two of the three primary forms of enforcement redundancy do exactly that, or have in the past. Expanding federal law enforcement jurisdiction over crimes already within state jurisdiction was designed to bring federal resources to bear on crimes where state resources were insufficient. 57 And private prosecution, where it [*861] still exists, has an equivalent effect - it permits victims to contribute private funds to public enforcement efforts. It is no coincidence that common law jurisdictions relied on private prosecution most heavily - through the mid- nineteenth century - when state capacity, including criminal justice infrastructure, was much thinner. 44 See, e.g., Paul D. Butler, Poor People Lose: Gideon and the Critique of Rights, 122 Yale L.J. 2176, 2204 (2013) (describing protest movements and other responses to racially disparate criminal justice policies); Roseanna Sommers, Will Putting Cameras on Police Reduce Polarization?, 125 Yale L.J. 1304, 1307-17 (2016) (describing polarized public perceptions of, and protests against, police uses of force and non-prosecution of police); What We Believe, Black Lives Matter, https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/what-we-believe (last visited Oct. 30, 2018). 45 See Avlana Eisenberg, Expressive Enforcement, 61 UCLA L.

Page 10 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *861 When resource constraints remain, however, they force officials to choose which cases get priority. That creates more opportunity for biases and favoritism to play a role in determining which cases to charge and which to forgo. That is especially so with crimes in which evidence development is more costly, so officials have to decide whether to invest scarce resources in those that require substantial investigative efforts. Both sexual assault and police violence cases often require larger-scale investments to develop evidence sufficient for prosecution. Failures to make those investments are common reasons for non- prosecution in both contexts. 59 IL. MECHANISMS OF PROSECUTORIAL ACCOUNTABILITY For a range of reasons and across a range of contexts, public prosecutors' failures to enforce criminal law have been of sufficient concern to lead contemporary justice systems to devise checks against unjustified underenforcement. Approaches take three basic forms: (1) limited authority for private parties to initiate or participate in criminal prosecutions; (2) independent review of initial non-prosecution decisions, upon petition from a [*862] victim; and (3) multiple, independent public prosecution agencies with independent authority to bring charges for the same wrongdoing. Outside the United States, the first two options predominate; their expansion in recent years is a direct consequence of broader reforms to expand crime victims' rights. 60 U.S. jurisdictions, however, rely almost wholly on the third model. Despite having adopted otherwise expansive victims' rights laws in recent decades in response to an influential movement for crime victims' rights, state and federal laws consistently and explicitly avoid granting any formal authority to private parties, or courts, over criminal charging. The next three Sections provide an overview of these options, where they exist. Largely with regard to U.S. policy choices only, they also suggest reasons that one model prevailed over others. A. Victim Rights and Private Versus Public Interests In the wake of victims' rights movements in North America and Europe, crime victims now have an array of legal rights once criminal charges are filed. Victims in the U.S. and European jurisdictions now commonly have rights to participate that include rights to consult with prosecutors, to be notified of and present at court proceedings, and to offer statements at stages such as hearings on bail, sentencing, and parole. 61 48 See Daniel Duane, Is It O.K. to Kill Cyclists?, N.Y.

In the contexts Eisenberg describes, prosecutors typically forgo hate-crime offenses in favor of other charges rather than declining to prosecute altogether. Though the focus here is on prosecutors, they may not be the key cause of underenforcement. For similar reasons, police may not investigate or arrest in such cases, or if they do prosecution can be undermined by lax evidence-gathering. Police practices are the focus on much of the scholarship on underenforcement of certain offenses. Much of the literature on inadequate enforcement of sexual assault crimes focuses on weaknesses in the police rather than prosecutors. See, e.g., Tuerkheimer, supra note 28, at 1292-99 (discussing evidence of police bias). 52 See, e.g., Alan Blinder, Michael Slager, Officer in Walter Scott Shooting, Gets 20-Year Sentence, N.Y.

Page 11 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *862 Under the criminal justice systems of all other major common law countries and nearly all European states, victims' rights also include authority to challenge prosecutors' decisions not to prosecute, either by a limited right to initiate prosecutions as private parties or by enabling victims to trigger judicial or [*863] administrative review of noncharging decisions. 62 By contrast, nearly every U.S. jurisdiction rejects these mechanisms. State and federal laws consistently avoid permitting victims any power to challenge or encroach on public prosecutorial authority. Federal law, for example, explicitly dictates that "nothing in this [victims' rights] chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction." 63 State statutes manifest the same policy in various ways, such as by prohibiting legal remedies for violations of participation rights they create. 64 U.S. laws limit victims' participation to "non-dispositive" forms, such as providing information and personal statements to prosecutors, judges, and parole boards, which facilitates victims' influence on public officials' decisionmaking. 65 But state and federal policy rejects enlisting victims as "agents of accountability" for public prosecution. 66 In U.S. jurisdictions and elsewhere, the conceptual innovation of victims' rights laws was to recognize victims' distinct private [*864] interests in public criminal litigation. Most rights are specific entitlements to advance victims' broader, dignitary right to be "treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity." 67 These provisions conceive of victims as "agents of individual rights" and "independent from systemic interests," and their interests can either conflict or align with those of law enforcement. 68 At the same time, victim participation rights can also be understood to serve a broader public interest in procedural outcomes, on the premise, for example, that prosecutors' and judges' decisions will improve with direct input from victims. Public decisionmaking risks substantive deficiency, and criminal process would be procedurally deficient, without due regard for victims' interests. Jurisdictions that empower victims to challenge non-prosecution decisions enable private parties themselves to address the problem of criminal law underenforcement. The remainder of this Section provides some detail on contemporary forms of private prosecution authority, their capacity to advance public as well as private interests, and reasons for its absence (or demise) in U.S. jurisdictions. 1.

Page 12 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *864 Public prosecutors now dominate enforcement decisions in both common law-based and civil law-based justice systems worldwide. That is hardly surprising, given the far-reaching regulatory scope of modern criminal law and high expectations that the state will ensure security against social disorder and innumerable harms, and will intervene in risk creation long before manifest criminal conduct or injury. 69 That agenda requires capacity, resources, and expertise that only public agencies can marshal. Moreover, a criminal enforcement regime that relied heavily on private plaintiffs would be one skewed against redress for poor victims who cannot bear litigation costs to vindicate their own interests. 70 Without safeguards, such a regime [*865] also could be at the mercy of the varied, perhaps idiosyncratic motives and interests of private actors lodging criminal complaints. Still, many countries continue to authorize private citizens to initiate criminal prosecutions when public officials do not, and others allow privately funded attorneys to assist or supplement public prosecutors in litigating criminal cases. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and England and Wales all continue to allow private prosecutions, " and fifteen of the twenty-eight member states of the European Union grant victims some comparable (*866] authority. 12 Details vary across jurisdictions, but everywhere private prosecutors' authority is limited by oversight from public [*867] prosecutors and courts. standard common law model is that public prosecutors retain the power to take over privately filed charges and then either try the case themselves, negotiate a plea bargain, or - more commonly when intervention occurs - dismiss the charges altogether. In this framework, private actors can press charges when public officials do not, but functionally they serve primarily as a mechanism for political accountability. Through private charging in the wake of public prosecutors' declination, victims force public officials to justify publicly their reasons for not charging and for vetoing privately filed charges - and to do so on grounds other than public resource constraints, given that a private actor has offered to bear the costs. Given the private cost barriers and the capacity of public prosecution agencies, it is unsurprising that, even where permitted, privately initiated charges nonetheless contribute to a tiny fraction of prosecutions on criminal dockets. 2. Abolition of Private Prosecution in State Criminal Justice U.S. jurisdictions are comparative exceptions; nearly all long ago prohibited privately initiated prosecutions, 75 even though in other contexts private actors continue to enforce public law in service of public interests. 76 But private criminal charges were 57 See Harmon, Policing Reform, supra note 21, at 20-51. Federal funding to state and local enforcement agencies is a more direct example of supplementing resources. Federal influence over local enforcement policies that comes with such funding is an attenuated version of enforcement redundancy.

Page 13 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *867 once common and significant in many state justice systems. U.S. colonies and states created public prosecution offices much earlier than England. 77 [*868] Even so, in the nation's earliest decades, those officials were often part-time or short-term officials, whose duties were often primarily quasi-judicial or administrative. 78 For those reasons, in many states those officials coexisted alongside private prosecutors with whom they shared some similarities. Early public prosecutors were paid by the case or the conviction pursued cases from private complainants. 80 But by the mid-nineteenth century, every state had public prosecutor offices of 81 Increasingly, they were full-time and accompanied by 1*869] public police forces. In this context, private prosecutions diminished, then vanished. However, because public prosecutors continued to suffer from poor funding (and consequently were held in low regard), 83 some states continued an alternate form of private prosecution: privately funded attorneys could assist in criminal prosecutions as long as the public prosecutor supervised or retained formal control. 84 This form of ancillary or supplementary private prosecution, which leaves charging decisions in public hands, is still permitted in several states. 85 Otherwise, only vestiges of private [*870] prosecution remain in a few states. Pennsylvania seems to have the strongest version: it permits private prosecutions for any offense upon the approval from a state prosecutor or a judge. 86 Rhode Island authorizes private prosecutions only for misdemeanors. 87 Under state common law, New Hampshire might permit the same for nonjailable offenses. 88 Beyond that, judges in many states can issue an arrest warrant or criminal summons based on a private person's testimony, but public prosecutors control whether to go forward with the case. 89 [*871] In sum, U.S. jurisdictions are unusual among common law jurisdictions in having abolished private prosecution as a means to vindicate victims' private interests, a supplement to public enforcement resources, and a structural check on selective underenforcement from biases in public prosecutors' discretionary decisions not to charge. English authorities, in contrast, explicitly recognize this public function for private prosecution. Private actors' authority to second-guess declination decisions - charging decision redundancy - operates as "the ultimate safeguard for the citizen against inaction on the part of the authorities." 90 The only remnant of this view in the United States seems to be in Pennsylvania. Its courts view victim-initiated 63 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6). Elsewhere, regarding victim complaints of rights violations to the Justice Department, the statute provides that "the Attorney General ... shall be the final arbiter of the complaint, and that there shall be no judicial review of the final decision of the Attorney General by a complainant." Id. § 3771(f)(2)(D); see also United States v. Thetford, 935 F. Supp. 2d 1280, 1282 (N.D. Ala. 2013) ("These rights, however, do not extend to giving crime victims veto power over the prosecutor's discretion."); Does v. United States, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337, 1343 (S.D. Fla. 2011) ("To the extent that the victims' pre-charge CVRA rights impinge upon prosecutorial discretion, under the plain language of the statute those rights must yield."). 64 See, e.g., Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2930.06(A) (West 2004) ("A prosecutor's failure to confer with a victim ... does not affect the validity" of a decision to dismiss charges, plea agreement, or other disposition). Only a few jurisdictions, such as California and the federal system, provide for meaningful enforcement of participation rights by, for example, allowing victims to intervene in trial proceedings to demand rights, or to appeal trial court violations; to facilitate a remedy, courts may order that a guilty plea or sentence be re-opened. See Cal. Const. art. I, § 28(c)(1) (stating that a victim may enforce a list of enumerated rights in trial or appellate court "as a matter of right"); 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d); cf. Paroline v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1710, 1718 (2014) (providing an example of a decision resulting from a victim's appeal of a restitution order). 65 See Ian Edwards, An Ambiguous Participant: The Crime Victim and Criminal Justice Decision-Making, 44 Brit. J. Criminology 967, 974 (2004) (classifying "dispositive" and "non-dispositive" forms of victim participation and putting modes of consultation, information- provision, and expression under the latter heading). 66 See Marie Manikis, Expanding Participation: Victims as Agents of Accountability in the Criminal Justice Process, Pub.

Page 14 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *871 prosecutions as fulfilling the same structural purpose. Allowing private actors to begin prosecutions meets "the need for a system of checks and balances on the office of the district attorney" and "constitutes a recognition by the legislature that the office of the district attorney should be subject to a system of checks and balances." 91 The rarity of private charges in jurisdictions that authorize them hardly justifies their abolition. Private prosecutions should be rare in well-functioning public prosecution systems, because public agencies pursue most provable cases and because private actors must bear considerable costs to press charges themselves. Moreover, other rules and institutions - including other safeguards on prosecutorial charging - endure despite few indications of their utility. There has never been a successful claim that a criminal charge violated the Equal Protection prohibition on racially biased charging, 92 but few argue the doctrine lacks at least normative value. 93 Grand juries rarely reject prosecutors' [*872] charging requests for indictments, but courts continue to tout them as a structural check on prosecutors. 94 Like private prosecution, these safeguards may work by deterring biased or ill-conceived prosecutorial decisions; their efficacy is probably impossible to measure. A contributing explanation for the U.S. aversion to private prosecution may lie in a familiar theme of U.S. law and history: race. During the first several decades of the nineteenth century, when private citizens could prosecute crimes, many states - and not only Southern ones - either denied African Americans legal capacity as litigants 95 or barred them from testifying under oath on the basis of race. Among other effects, those barriers barred private prosecutions by African Americans. 96 After 1865 - an era in which rights to litigate and testify were viewed by many as more meaningful than the right to vote 97 - those race- based legal disabilities were abolished. 98 In the same period, private charging authority, already on the decline, was abolished in most [*873] states that still permitted it. States that retained a formal litigation role for crime victims did so by allowing privately funded attorneys to assist in prosecutions filed and controlled by public prosecutors, thus ensuring that public officials are the exclusive gatekeepers of criminal law enforcement. Between the 1840s and 1860s, prosecutors had become locally elected officials in nearly all states. That effectively aligned their charging monopoly with the preferences of local white majorities (or white minorities in localities in which black citizens were the majority, once Southern whites succeeded in disenfranchising black citizens). 99 Evidence for the relationship between race and the demise of private prosecution is 69 Among myriad examples are crimes of preparation, conspiracy, possession of contraband, consensual exchanges (e.g., of drugs or sex for money), and many kinds of criminal attempts. See Andrew Ashworth & Lucia Zedner, Preventive Justice 95-118, 171-223 (2014). 70 Douglas Campbell, 2 The Puritan in Holland, England, and America 444 (1892) (criticizing the English system of private prosecution as one "by the rich for the rich"); Joan E.

Page 15 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *873 correlative rather than causal, but it nonetheless suggests a reason for why state justice systems took a different path from other common-law jurisdictions and abolished private charging. Local white majorities had little need for a structural check on prosecutors they elected, and they likely did not want a way for African-American citizens to challenge prosecutors and independently pursue their interests in criminal courts. Prosecution redundancy would reduce the control of local majorities to dictate enforcement policies, including preferences for selective underenforcement. B. Judicial and Administrative Review of Decisions Not to Charge A second structure that creates some redundant authority over decisions not to prosecute exposes those prosecutorial decisions to review, either by courts or by supervising officials within an administrative hierarchy. As with private prosecution, this mechanism is almost nonexistent among U.S. jurisdictions, with the significant exception of federal law. But this option has gained ground elsewhere, in England and throughout E.U. countries. In all these contexts, its adoption responds to demands for expanded victims' rights in the criminal process. This Section briefly surveys prominent examples of noncharging review in federal law and Europe, then considers why state justice systems uniformly reject it. [*874] 1. Oversight of Declination Decisions in Europe Pursuant to an E.U. Directive, 100 twenty-five of the twenty-eight member states of the European Union grant crime victims formal rights to seek review of decisions not to file criminal charges based on their complaints. 101 The details of these review procedures vary. Some authorize judicial review of prosecutors' decisions; most jurisdictions, including Scotland and France, provide at least a means for review by independent officials within the prosecution agency, perhaps with an additional possibility for judicial review. 102 Although E.U. nations with common law-based legal systems, such as Ireland, Northern Ireland, 103 and England, have adopted versions of this practice, the [*875] practice is more established in civil law jurisdictions, likely because it is consistent with the longstanding duty in some civil law countries of mandatory prosecution.

Scotland is much more restrictive. See Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, c. 21, § 310A (Scot.)

Page 16 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *875 The mandatory prosecution duty, known as the "legality principle," is itself a safeguard against selective underenforcement due to bias or favoritism. It is primarily an anti-discrimination injunction, intended to ensure that prosecutors treat like cases alike, rather than a mandate to ensure public safety and order through full enforcement. 105 Administrative and judicial enforceability of that duty is intended to ensure its effectiveness. 2. Oversight of Declination Decisions in England and Wales The United Kingdom was an E.U. member state when the victim's right Directive was issued, 106 and its largest criminal [*876] justice system - the combined jurisdictions of England and Wales - provides several grounds on which victims or other aggrieved parties may obtain both administrative and judicial review of non-prosecution decisions. Yet the reasons for this relate foremost to public rather than private interests: "a decision not to prosecute, especially in circumstances where it is believed or asserted that the decision is or may be erroneous, can affect public confidence in the integrity and competence of the criminal justice system." 107 In line with other E.U. member states, English victims can seek administrative review within the Crown Prosecution Service. The process appears to be meaningful; in recent years, between seven and thirteen percent of prosecution decisions challenged in this way have been reversed. 108 Moreover, noncharging decisions are also subject to judicial review - a policy rarely seen in other common law jurisdictions. 109 The standard is deferential, but English courts do periodically overturn non-prosecution decisions after evaluating them against written standards in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and other guidelines. 110 English courts have disapproved of decisions not to prosecute upon finding they were based on an unlawful policy !! or were found to be [*877) "perverse" under a general reasonableness standard. 112 And in particular contrast to U.S. law with regard to lethal force by police, English judges give special scrutiny to cases that arise from deaths in state custody, which by their nature raise the specter of prosecutorial favoritism toward fellow law enforcement officials. 113 Employers' Insolvency (1987); Comm. of Ministers, Council of Eur., Recommendation No. R (85) 11 of the Committee of Ministers to Members States on the Position of the Victim in the Framework of Criminal Law and Procedure (1985). For analysis of Directive 2012/29 as well as Council of Europe recommendations, see Buczma, supra note 61, at 242-48. In Germany, victims can initiate a private prosecution for certain minor offenses, and for more serious offenses may take a formal role as accessory prosecutors with rights to participate in proceedings and to be heard before charges are dismissed. See Strafprozessordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure], §§374-94, translation at https://www.gesetze-im-internet.delenglisch_ stpo/englisch_stpo.html (describing rights of privateklage); id. §8153, 395-402 (describing rights of nebenklager); see also id.§8403-406c (describing compensation); id. § 172 (describing victim's right to seek court order to compel public prosecution); Michael Bohlander, Principles of German Criminal Procedure 25, 64 (2012). 73 This describes, for example, the German system that allows private parties to act as accessory prosecutors alongside public prosecutors. See Strafprozessordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure],88153, 395-402 (describing rights of nebenklager). 74 See, e.g., Commonwealth Dir. of Pub. Prosecutions, supra note 71 (reporting three private prosecutions in federal courts in 2014-15). 75 By the end of the nineteenth century, state and federal justice systems were firmly committed to the principle that prosecution is an exclusive power of public officials in which private victims have no role or standing. See Malley v. Lane, 115 A. 674, 676 (Conn. 1921); cf. Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973) ('[A] citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.... In American jurisprudence at least, a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another."). 76 See Manikis, supra note 66. 77 See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 5-7; Jack M. Kress, Progress and Prosecution, 423 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 99, 100 (1976); Allen Steinberg, From Private Prosecution to Plea Bargaining: Criminal Prosecution, the District Attorney, and American Legal History, 30 Crime & Deling. 568, 571-72 (1984) (finding that private prosecutions predominated in the colonies). In 1704, Connecticut established what was probably the first public prosecutor's office. See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 17; Kress, supra, at 103. When Blackstone described criminal law as predominantly directed at public wrongs, he did so in the context of a late eighteenth century justice system in which private prosecutions were common. See 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England: Book the Fourth 5-6 (1795). 78 See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 23 (concluding that after 1789 "for the first half-century at least" the public prosecutor was "clearly a minor actor in the court's structure" with a more judicial than executive role); Stephanie A.J.

Federal Oversight of Declination Decisions In the United States, only the federal justice system provides for a process of administrative review somewhat comparable to those in E.U. member states. Federal law grants victims a right to seek review of prosecutors' decisions within the Department of Justice hierarchy, although it also explicitly bars judicial review of Justice Department decisions in this process. 114 Although decision makers in an internal review process have less institutional independence from those they review than do judges engaged in judicial review, they also have a comparative advantage in institutional expertise, which could translate into less deference to, and more meaningful oversight of, front-line prosecutors. In addition, federal law guarantees victims "the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case." 115 The Department of Justice interprets this not to create a right to confer before charges are filed, reasoning that no "case" exists until charges are filed. 116 Some lower courts have interpreted the statute differently, however, and concluded that it [*879] creates an enforceable right for victims to confer with prosecutors before, and about, the charging decision. One held that prosecutors cannot enter a non-prosecution agreement with a suspect until they confer with victims, and that if they fail to do so the court can order prosecutors to re-open the non-prosecution agreement. 117 A few other lower federal courts have reached similar conclusions, 118 although at least two have opposing conclusions. 119 Even in its stronger form, this is a limited entitlement, in effect, to an opportunity to try to influence charging decisions. Even the most aggressive federal courts on this point do not examine prosecutors' good faith during consultations or their reasons for disagreeing with victims. In sum, neither the consultation right nor the right to review by Justice Department supervisors infringes federal prosecutors' monopoly power over charging from judicial oversight. for the court calendar). England had no full-scale prosecution agency until the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. See Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, c. 23. The Director of Public Prosecutions office was established in 1879, but it supplemented rather than displaced private prosecution. See Glanville Williams, The Power to Prosecute, Crim. L. Rev. 596, 601-03 (1955) (noting 1879 creation of Director of Public Prosecutions and describing police as de facto public prosecutors). 79 See Parrillo, supra note 58. 80 Professional police forces did not arise until the 1850s, so victims investigated crimes and arrested offenders. See Peggy M. Tobolowsky, Victim Participation in the Criminal Justice Process: Fifteen Years After the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, 25 New Eng. J. Crim. & Civ. Confinement 21, 25 (1999) (explaining that, to arrest offenders, victims could enlist the "aid of the local watchman, justice of the peace, or constable for whose assistance the victim paid"). 81 See, e.g., Mike McConville & Chester Mirsky, Jury Trials and Plea Bargaining: A True History 25-42 (2005) (describing early systems in New York of judicial or gubernatorial appointment of prosecutors, until the office first became elective in 1847); Allen Steinberg, The Transformation of Criminal Justice: Philadelphia, 1800-1880, at 152-58 (1989) (stating that Philadelphia first elected its district attorney in 1850). Prosecutors as well as judges became elected positions in many states as part of a wave of state constitutional reform in the mid- nineteenth century. See, e.g., Ind. Const. art. 7, § 11 (1851); Md. Const. art. 5 (1851); see also id. art. 3 (forbidding creation of state attorney general office); Mich. Const. arts. 8, 10 (1850); N.Y. Const. art. 10 (1846); N.C. Const. art. 4, § 29 (1868); Va. Const. art. 6,886, 8, 30 (1851). 82 See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 6 (arguing that American prosecutors evolved from weak to strong figures largely because they were popularly elected and tied to local government organization). Public and private prosecutors coexisted for a few decades in some places. See Cantrell v. Commonwealth, 329 S.E.2d 22, 25 (Va. 1985) (describing the history of private prosecution in Virginia); State v. Stein, 30 S.C.L. (1 Rich.) 189, 190 (S.C. 1845) (affirming that private individuals may file criminal or civil actions for the same offense but must elect the form before trial); Corley v. Williams, 17 S.C.L. (1 Bail.) 588, 588-89 (S.C. 1830) (providing an example of private prosecution). Pennsylvania and New York relied heavily on private prosecutors for criminal law enforcement before 1850. See Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98 U.S. 187, 198 (1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) ("Every man in the community, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another, has a perfect right, by law, to institute such prosecution, subject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his suit."); McConville & Mirsky, supra note 81 (describing New York courts with private prosecutors and, prior to 1847, judicial or gubernatorial appointments of public prosecutors); Steinberg, supra note 81, at 24-69, 152-57 (describing private prosecutions, screened by aldermen acting as magistrates, and creation of elected district attorney's office in 1852). 83 Robert M. Ireland, Privately Funded Prosecution of Crime in the Nineteenth-Century United States, 39 Am. J. Legal Hist. 43, 44-45 (1995) (recounting numerous comments by state supreme courts on the low quality and inadequate funding of public prosecutor offices). DAVID SCHOEN HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016526

Page 18 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *879 1*880] 4. Oversight of Declination Decisions in State Justice Systems State justice systems do not go as far as the federal system does, much less provide the kind of oversight or victim recourse that European systems now offer. And this is so despite the fact that all states have adopted substantial victims' bills of rights, nearly all of which include rights for victims to consult with prosecutors. Most make clear that the consultation right attaches only after the prosecutor decides to file charges. 120 Rights of administrative review are rare. 121 One reason for that is surely structural. The U.S. Department of Justice is a hierarchically organized agency within which all federal prosecutors operate, a structure that enables supervisory and quasi-independent review within the agency. But few states follow that model. Instead, prosecutors in most states are locally elected and operate [*881] autonomously from state justice departments or attorneys general, which generally exercise little, if any, oversight. 122 Administrative review of state prosecutors' charging decisions is simply not feasible without major reorganization of state justice systems. That structural barrier probably explains why state prosecutors' decisions are functionally immune to administrative oversight, but the lack of judicial oversight has a different origin. In accord with common law tradition, state and federal courts have never meaningfully reviewed public prosecutors' noncharging decisions. 123 In particular, they have unambiguously rejected victims' claims of standing to challenge those decisions. 124 A few 1*882] limited exceptions prove the rule. In cases of private criminal complaints filed by alleged victims, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania authorize judges to review public prosecutors' decisions not to charge. 125 Even when statutes grant courts the power to review (or even mandate review) of charging and dismissal decisions, state judges consistently have refused to scrutinize the merits of prosecutors' judgments. Many states have replaced the common law rule that gave prosecutors complete discretion to nolle prosequi (or dismiss) any criminal charge with statutes that require judges to confirm that non-prosecution is in the interest of justice. Yet courts uniformly refuse to engage in meaningful review, inferring instead that those statutes require deference to 127 prosecutors. 84 See Erikson v. Pawnee Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 263 F.3d 1151, 1154 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding no due process violation because private attorney assisting prosecution did not "control[] critical prosecutorial decisions"). The first states to prohibit privately funded prosecutors even under supervision of public prosecutors were Massachusetts, Michigan, and Wisconsin. See Commonwealth v. Gibbs, 70 Mass. (4 Gray) 146, 147-48 (1855); Meister v. People, 31 Mich. 99, 104-06 (1875); Biemel v. State, 37 N.W. 244, 248-49 (Wis. 1888). See also Ireland, supra note 83, at 49 (listing fifteen states that still approved privately funded prosecutors in 1900). Other states abolished this practice more recently. See State ex rel. Wild v. Otis, 257 N.W.2d 361, 365 (Minn. 1977) (holding that party has no right of private prosecution); State v. Harrington, 534 S.W.2d 44, 48 (Mo. 1976) (holding that a right of private prosecution should not be permitted); People v. Calderone, 573 N.Y.S. 2d 1005, 1007 (N.Y. City Crim. Ct. 1991) (concluding that under New York law private prosecutions by interested parties or their attorneys present inherent conflicts of interest which violate defendants' due process rights); State v. Best, 186 S.E.2d 1, 4 (N.C. 1972) (noting that a public prosecutor must be in charge of all prosecutions). 85 See, e.g., N.J. Ct. R. 3:23-9 (permitting private prosecutor with approval of the public prosecutor and court); N.J. Ct. R. 7:8-7(b) (permitting private prosecutor for cross-complaints with court approval); State v. Harton, 296 S.E.2d 112, 113 (Ga. 1982) (private party not allowed to prosecute without state approval); State v. Moose, 313 S.E.2d 507, 512-13 (N.C. 1984) (stating that private attorneys may assist public solicitors where public solicitors retain control and management of prosecution); Cantrell, 329 S.E.2d at 25 (stating that private attorneys may assist commonwealth attorneys with the permission of the prosecutor and the court); 63C Am. Jur. 2d Prosecuting Attorneys § 12 (2018) (citing authority in some states that private attorneys may assist public prosecutors). For a state statute that apparently gives the "prosecuting witness" a right to pay a private attorney to assist the public prosecutor without the latter's consent, see Kan. Stat. Ann. § 19-717 (2017); see also John D. Bessler, The Public Interest and the Unconstitutionality of Private Prosecutors, 47 Ark. L. Rev. 511, 529, nn. 71-72 (1994) (citing cases in majority of states allowing private prosecutors to assist in public prosecutions). Bessler identifies three states that "allow private prosecutors to participate without the consent or supervision of the district attorney," but in all three states, the public prosecutor initiated and litigated the criminal charge, while the private prosecutor assisted in the litigation as counsel to a victim. Id. at 529, n.71. 86 234 Pa. Code § 506 (2001); In re Private Criminal Complaints of Rafferty, 969 A.2d 578, 582 (Pa. 2009) (discussing the ability of a prosecutor to approve or disapprove of private complaints). Judges may authorize private counsel to take over as prosecutor upon finding that a district attorney has "neglected or refuseed to prosecute" a properly grounded charge. See 16 Pa. Stat. and Cons.

Page 19 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *882 [*883] This is a stark contrast with European justice systems, but U.S. jurisdictions are not alone in shielding prosecution decisions from judicial oversight. Aside from England and Wales, courts in other common law jurisdictions - notably Canada and Australia - take roughly the same approach and defer to prosecutorial charging discretion. 128 5. Summary of Declination Oversight Both private prosecution and review procedures provide a kind of redundancy that checks prosecutorial declination decisions, and both can do so in service of public interests as well as victims' private interests. Both options have some capacity to challenge prosecutorial judgments affected by political or personal biases, institutional allegiances (especially between police and local politicians), or other illicit sources of favor or disfavor. As one commentator put it in the English context, private prosecution authority recognizes that victims possess some capacity to be independent "assessors of the evidence as well as the public interest." 129 Review procedures enable judges and supervisory [*884] officials to do much the same thing, without the cost barriers for victims posed by private prosecutions. (Although it may well be that poorer victims are less likely even to petition for review, especially if they lack legal counsel to press their review requests.) Why, then, have U.S. jurisdictions so uniformly rejected both options? As noted, both racial politics and the power of common law tradition are probable contributing reasons. 130 Another is the singular choice of most state justice systems to make prosecutors locally elected officials, which does much to prevent kinds of over-and underenforcement disfavored by local majorities. That, in turn, likely reduces pressure for reforms that would improve other safeguards against decisions not to prosecute - especially decisions that cut against popular local preferences, which in many communities include rigorous 2016) (authorizing victims dissatisfied with public prosecutor to petition the court and granting courts the power to allow victim's attorney to take over as private prosecutor). 87 See 12 R.I. Gen. Laws5'§12-4-1, 12-4-2, 12-4-6, 12-12-1.3 (2017); Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 871 (R.I. 2001) (approving private misdemeanor prosecution for assault under state statutes). 88 See State v. Martineau, 808 A.2d 51, 54 (N.H. 2002); see also State by Tucker v. Gratta, 133 A.2d 482, 482 (N.H. 1957) holding that state prosecutors retain power to dismiss private criminal complaints). 89 See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat.S§15A-303, 304 (2016); Moose, 313 S.E.2d at 512-13 (requiring that the public prosecutor remain in continuous control of the case). Scattered marginal remnants of private enforcement may remain elsewhere, such as an Oklahoma statute providing that prosecutions for adultery (a felony) may be "commenced and carried on against either of the parties to the crime only by his or her own husband or wife." Okla. Stat. tit. 21 § 871(2017) ("Prosecution for adultery can be commenced and carried on against either of the parties to the crime only by his or her own husband or wife as the case may be, or by the husband or wife of the other party to the crime."). 90 The Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, 1981, Cmnd. 8092, P 7.47 (UK); see also Gouriet v. Union of Post Office Workers [1978] AC (HL) 435 at 477 (Eng, and Wales) (private prosecutions are a "valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on the part of the authority"); cf. Manikis, supra note 66, at 67, 71 (describing review as a means to correct prosecution errors). 91 In re Hickson, 2000 PA Super 402, PP 22, 41; see also In re Piscanio, 344 A.2d 658, 660-61 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1975) ("The judge's independent review of the complaint checks and balances the district attorney's decision and further hedges against possibility of error."). 92 United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 461-64 (1996). 93 Arguments for strengthening the doctrine to make claims easier to pursue are common. See, e.g., Richard H. McAdams, Race and Selective Prosecution: Discovering the Pitfalls of Armstrong, 73 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 605, 606 (1998) (discussing use of the equal protection doctrine but challenging current precedent). 94 Grand juries remain a fixture in the federal system and in roughly half the states. See Sara Sun Beale et al., Grand Jury Law and Practice § 1:5 (2d ed. 2017) (describing grand jury status and rules in states and noting states that have partially or wholly abolished grand juries); Andrew D. Leipold, Why Grand Juries Do Not (and Cannot) Protect the Accused, 80 Cornell L. Rev. 260, 274-75 (1995) (noting difficulty of getting data on grand jury screening and offering reasons why grand juries rarely reject requests for indictments). To extend the comparison, public officials (judges) have a long track record of doing the same task that trial and grand juries do. That available substitute did not lead to calls for juries' abolition. Yet the availability of public prosecutors as replacements led to the U.S. jurisdictions to abolish private prosecutors.

Page 20 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *884 prosecution of excessive police uses of force. Finally, another institution responds to some of the same underenforcement problems that private prosecution and judicial review could address - redundant prosecution authority in a federal system. C. Federalism Safeguards on Prosecutorial Discretion The scope of the U.S. federal criminal code expanded vastly in the twentieth century, as did the federal government's institutional capacity to enforce that code and its regulatory authority more generally. The result has been a distinctive form of criminal justice federalism: federal enforcement authority wholly overlaps the territorial scope of state criminal law, and the federal code substantially overlaps much of what is covered in state criminal codes. The resulting structure of redundant federal-state authority has evolved into a means - unusual even among federal nation-states - to second-guess and effectively trump state prosecutors' declination decisions without empowering courts or private parties. No other nation built on a federal model incorporates nearly [*885] the same degree of redundancy between state and federal justice systems. 131 The more common model of criminal justice federalism is found in Canada and Germany: each has a single national criminal code that is administered by separate state-level prosecution agencies and court systems. 132 Other federal states follow the U.S. model and have separate criminal codes, prosecution agencies, and court systems in each state as well as for the federal government. Australia follows this model, but the scope and jurisdiction of Australian federal criminal law is much more limited than is U.S. federal law; federal crimes are largely confined to offenses that implicate distinct federal interests - it is probably closer to U.S. federal criminal law in 1910 than 2010. The result is that in Australia federal criminal law enforcement overlaps much less with state criminal law. The broad redundancy provided by U.S. federalism enables federal prosecutors to serve as checks on underenforcement by state prosecutors, at least for some large and important categories [*886] of crime. In effect, federal prosecutors can review the declination decisions of state prosecutors - as well as the adequacy and success of their prosecutions - and then decide whether to file federal charges in cases that their state counterparts declined to pursue, charged too leniently, or in which they failed to win a conviction or sufficiently harsh sanctions. (In theory state prosecutors conduct the same oversight over much of 95 See George Fisher, The Jury's Rise as Lie Detector, 107 Yale L.J. 575, 671-96 (1997) (discussing the impact of racial policies in post-Civil War jury and court processes). 96 I am aware of no historical research on African American private prosecutors, and I have found no evidence of any in case law or general accounts of private prosecutions. 97 See, e.g., Fisher, supra note 95, at 684 n.514 ("Denial to the freedman of the power to testify in court against the white man ... strikes not at a mere civil franchise, but at a natural right - the right of protecting life and property. When a white man may take a freedman's life or property with impunity, if no other white men be present, the freedman has no security for either." (quoting The Progress of Reconstruction, N.Y. Times, Oct. 3, 1865, at 4)). 98 When Southern states were compelled to grant African American citizens litigation rights, they imposed strict conditions, permitting African Americans the right to testify only when the crime victim (or the opposing civil litigant) was African American. Id. at 684. Those limitations likewise restricted African Americans' private prosecution authority, although in many places racial customs, backed by the prospect of racial violence, was probably discouragement enough. See generally Douglas A. Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name: The Re- Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II (2008) (discussing history of African Americans' distrust of America's judicial system); Nicholas Lemann, Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War (2007) (exploring incidents after the Civil War and the impact on politics during the Reconstruction Era). 99 Michael J. Klarman, From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality 49-51 (2004). Northern states were not models of race-blind democracy. Connecticut voters in 1865 rejected a proposal to enfranchise African American citizens in their state. Fisher, supra note 95, at 685. 100 See Council Directive 2012/29, art. 11, 2012 O.J.

Rev. 844, *886 federal enforcement practice, but this is less common.) 134 State prosecutors' decisions, at least for certain categories of serious wrongdoing, face de facto review by federal executive officials. Or so the law for a century has permitted. The constitutional double jeopardy doctrine since at least 1922 has recognized the "dual sovereignty" of state and federal governments. Notwithstanding the guarantee that no person shall "be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy," the Double Jeopardy Clause has been understood not to preclude federal prosecutors' power to charge a person who has previously been prosecuted by state officials for the same criminal conduct, and federal prosecutions likewise do not limit subsequent state enforcement efforts. 135 By granting certiorari in United States v. Gamble this term, 136 the U.S. Supreme Court is set to revisit this doctrine, which provides the foundation for the federalism-based check on underenforcement. Federal prosecutors do not attempt to keep an eye on all state prosecution decisions and practices, and federal criminal [*887] law is not fully coextensive with state criminal law; significant gaps are discussed in the next Part. But the substantive redundancy is considerable. For some areas of dual authority - such as drug crimes, fraud, child pornography, and human trafficking - federal and state agencies often coordinate investigative efforts and divide up prosecution responsibilities. But federal Justice Department policy to exercise oversight of state enforcement practices in certain categories of crime is deliberate and formalized. Notable examples include state and local government corruption, excessive use of force and other wrongdoing by police, and other criminal civil rights violations. 137 Especially in these areas, federal prosecutors assess whether to file their own charges in cases in which their state counterparts declined to charge, charged too leniently, or in which they failed to win appropriate convictions. Federal prosecution in the wake of state declination is hardly the norm - it should not be, if state prosecutors decline cases for the right reasons 138 - but federal officials do remedy meaningful enforcement gaps left by state prosecutors. 139 Functionally, this inter-governmental model of review resembles intra-agency administrative review with greater independence between initial decision makers and subsequent reviewers. Oversight of state prosecutors rests with the policy [*888] priorities of federal executive branch officials.

Rev. 844, *888 institutional culture of professionalism than many state prosecutor offices, departmental policies and priorities can change substantially with presidential administrations - as they have recently. 141 Nonetheless, this federalism-based model of prosecutorial oversight has an advantage shared by the administrative review schemes within single prosecution agencies. In both settings, those with review power are prosecutors who should have greater institutional competence and legitimacy to second-guess other prosecutors' charging decisions, and consequently less inclination than courts to defer to prosecutorial judgments. This federalist model of enforcement redundancy did not evolve from earlier common law institutional arrangements, like private prosecution, nor from the modern victims' rights movement, like judicial and administrative review of decisions not to prosecute. Federal criminal law enforcement expanded for several reasons, but behind many of those reasons is a common purpose: to remedy glaring patterns of underenforcement by the states. For example, federal law and institutional capacity (such as the advent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation) expanded in response to states' inability to confront adequately the rise of interstate violence and drug crimes (as well as, for a time, prohibition on alcohol manufacture and distribution). Federal law [*889] took on the primary role in combatting local government corruption - including police corruption and excessive uses of force - which local prosecution agencies often lacked the ability, or political independence, to confront. 143 And federal law has long attempted to fill the gap when racially biased local police, prosecutors, and juries declined to arrest, prosecute, or convict suspects - especially white ones - who victimized black citizens. 144 In sum, the redundant enforcement 104 Strafprozebetaordnung [StPO] [Code of Criminal Procedure], 8§152, 160, 170, translation at https://www.gesetze-im- internet.delenglisch_ stpo/englisch_stpo.html (Ger.)

Page 23 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *889 authority developed as part of the modern model U.S. federalism has much in common, in functional terms, with private prosecution and review of prosecutorial declination decisions. All are mechanisms to guard against unjustified nonenforcement, or underenforcement, by jurisdictions' primary prosecution agencies. The next Part examines the relative strengths of these alternatives. III. PROS AND CONS OF FEDERALISM-BASED ENFORCEMENT REDUNDANCY A. Comparative Limits of Enforcement-Oversight Strategies Each of the institutional approaches to reducing underenforcement of criminal law by public prosecutors has comparative strengths and weaknesses. All three share the common virtue of being a means to reduce instances of bias, favoritism, or other misjudgments that result in unjustified nonenforcement. All three enable outside reevaluation of declination decisions. Private prosecution empowers motivated private parties - crime victims - to initiate the challenge to a public prosecutor's decision not to charge by filing charges themselves. The same is true in jurisdictions that subject declination decisions to formal administrative or judicial review; victims trigger that process by petitioning for an independent evaluation. Both of those practices harness the motivations of interested private parties to, in effect, screen which declination decisions should be subject to reassessment, although private prosecution poses a significant cost barrier for victims who want to take advantage of it. At the same time, both of these practices give public officials the final [*890] word on whether a prosecution (public or private) will proceed. The federalism route to prosecutorial oversight, by contrast, gives private parties no formal role, although victims can file complaints and lobby federal prosecutors just as they can with local police and prosecutors for any alleged crime. Put differently, federal prosecution as check on state underenforcement rests more directly on the initiative, diligence, and judgment of federal prosecutors than private victims. In some areas, federal commitment is significant. 145 But it also varies with the policy priorities of presidential administrations, which can vary considerably in their commitment to fighting certain kinds of crimes and to federal oversight of state criminal justice administration. 146 106 The U.K. is scheduled to leave the European Union in 2019.

The percentage of prosecution decisions challenged in this way has been well below one percent - 0.13% in 2016-17, and 0.17% in 2014-15 - which suggests the administrative burden is manageable. See id. 109 See Balderstone v. R (1983), 23 Man. R. (2d) 125, at para. 28 (Can. Man. C.A.)

That a judge must not do."). 110 Decisions to discontinue a prosecution after charging get similar scrutiny.

England created its prosecution agency, the Crown Prosecution Service, only in 1985. See Prosecution Offences Act 1985, c. 23, § 1 (Eng. and Wales); Andrew Ashworth & Mike Redmayne, The Criminal Process 222-23 (4th ed. 2010). The Director of Public Prosecutions was created in 1879 but did not handle most prosecutions until the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service. In the intervening century, police came to dominate filing of criminal charges, supplemented by private prosecutions, a system that eventually was viewed as providing insufficient supervision of charging decisions by police. See Williams, supra note 78. DAVID SCHOEN HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016532

Page 24 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *890 But that distinction has an upside: private prosecution and judicial review do not work in cases in which there is no direct victim - or in which private parties do not realize they have been victimized, as in some cases of large-scale corporate or government fraud, or in some cases of child pornography. 147 Federal prosecutors, however, take on just such cases as a core part of their enforcement agenda. 148 On the other hand, federal oversight is limited in other important respects: federal criminal enforcement authority is not fully coextensive with state criminal law; notably, for example, it provides effectively no enforcement redundancy for ordinary domestic violence, rape, and other sexual assault offenses. 149 1*891] B. Three Kinds of Offenses: Corruption, Police Violence, Sexual Assault Consider the efficacy for these oversight options with respect three types of offenses: local fraud or corruption, excessive use of force and other wrongdoing by local law enforcement officers, and sexual assaults. These three classes of offenses have in common that they have proven to be especially vulnerable to underenforcement. At the same time, the differences in how U.S. criminal justice institutions have responded to underenforcement in each area highlight the efficacy and limits of the federalism-based enforcement redundancy compared to the alternatives - both those U.S. jurisdictions reject (private prosecution and judicial review) and a fourth, unique strategy they embrace: politically accountable prosecutors. 1. Public Corruption Corrupt conduct by government officials is a category of wrongdoing especially likely to suffer from underenforcement, for obvious reasons: we depend on one set of public officials, prosecutors and investigative agents, to stop wrongdoing by other public officials - as well as by colleagues within their own ranks. Professional and even personal relationships often exist between these groups of public officials. Even when the boundaries between lawful and unlawful conduct are clear and law 112 R (Da Silva) v. DPP [2006] EWHC (Admin) 3204 [24] (Eng. and Wales) (summarizing three grounds for review and citing R v. DPP [1995] (QB) 1 Crim. App. 136 (Eng.)); R (Guest) v. DPP [2009] EWHC (Admin.) 594, [2009] 2 Crim. App. 26, at P 34 (Eng. and Wales); R v. General Council of the Bar [1990] 3 All ER 137 (QB), at 137-38 (Eng. and Wales). For an overview, see Ashworth & Redmayne, supra note 111; Christopher Hilson, Discretion to Prosecute and Judicial Review, Crim. L. Rev. 739 (1993) (examining case law regarding prosecution decisions and subsequent judicial review); Appeals: Judicial Review of Prosecutorial Decisions, CPS, https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/appeals -judicial-review-prosecutorial-decisions (last updated May 21, 2009). The European Convention on Human Rights may impose affirmative obligations on member states that certain instances require prosecutions, or that more generally require a state to maintain a criminal justice system that provides sufficient protection to citizens. English courts found that their established standards of review of noncharging decisions, based in domestic law, have been held sufficient to meet any such obligation. See R (FB) v. DPP [2009] EWHC (Admin.) 106,[2009] Crim. App. 38, at P 64 (Eng. and Wales) (discussing state obligations under Articles 2 and 3); see also R v. Killick [2011] EWCA (Crim.) 1608, [2012] 1 Crim. App. 10 at [48] (confirming victims' right to review). Judges may require disclosure of internal prosecution documents, but they assess the lawfulness of nonprosecution without examining the underlying evidence. See R (Da Silva) v. DPP [2006] EWHC (Admin) 3204 [24] (Eng. and Wales) (noting use of redacted investigative report and case notes from CPS but disavowing evaluation of evidence). 113 See R v. DPP [2001] QB 330 at 337 (Eng. and Wales); R v. Metro. Police Commr. [1958] 2 QB 118, at 123-25 (Eng. and Wales); Ashworth & Redmayne, supra note 111, at 221-22. Decisions by U.S. courts give no special solicitude to instances of nonprosecution in the wake of injuries or deaths caused by prison guards or other law enforcement officials. See, e.g., Leeke v. Timmerman, 454 U.S. 84, 85-87 (1981) (rejecting state prison inmates' federal civil claim alleging bad faith by state officials to block issuance of arrest warrants against guards on allegations of unnecessary beatings during prison uprising); Inmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, 477 F.2d 375, 382-83 (2d Cir. 1973) (rejecting request, on behalf of inmates injured or killed by state prison guards in the wake of a prison riot, that federal courts compel state and federal prosecutors to charge guards, reaffirming that prosecutorial discretion is immune to judicial review). To facilitate review, English prosecutors in some circumstances must provide public reasons for choosing not to file charges. See Jordan v. United Kingdom (No. 2) [2003] 37 Eur. Ct. H.R. 52 PP 82-86, 122-23, 142-45 (holding that under article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights prosecutors should give reasons explaining a decision not to bring criminal charges after an investigation into a death caused by police shootings); see also R v. DPP [2001] QB 330, at 347 (Lord Bingham, CJ) (Eng. and Wales) ("In the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons, we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case [of non-prosecution]: to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution will follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given ...."; EU Council Directive 2012/29, supra note 100, art. 6, at 67 (requiring explanations to victims that can be subjected to review). Irish victim rights laws that took effect in 2015 now require prosecutors to provide reasons to victims for declining to prosecute.

Page 25 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *891 enforcement can learn of misconduct done mostly in secret, political or personal incentives for enforcement officials that discourage zealous enforcement can exist for enforcement officials in the same jurisdiction - perhaps enmeshed in the same political networks. In short, underenforcement in this realm follows more from favoritism toward offenders than the biases against victim groups or types of offenses. "Corruption" is a notoriously hard concept to define, 150 but that difficulty is actually somewhat useful for present purposes. Some of what constitutes public corruption is relatively clearly [*892] defined in positive law. Easy cases involve straightforward property theft or embezzlement, quid pro quo bribery, and extortion. 151 Statutes also make clear at least some cases of illegal gratuities and breaches of regulations that govern activities such as campaign finance. 152 More ambiguous or marginal cases of alleged corruption, however, illustrate the federal government's ambitious commitment to enforcing broad interpretations of federal anti-corruption laws to conduct of state and local officials. That enforcement track record demonstrates the strong commitment to enforcement redundancy in this area. States have their own regulatory strategies to address government corruption, although independent assessments do not judge them to be particularly successful. 153 The federal government seems to share that view. The Justice Department created a Public Integrity Section within the Criminal Division in 1976, 154 and in the four decades since, federal prosecutors have [*893] aggressively prosecuted conduct of state and local officials that it determines breaches federal anti-corruption statutes. 155 For the past two decades, federal anti-corruption prosecutions of state and local officials typically average 350-400 per year. 156 Combatting "public corruption" is a top priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on par with combating threats of terrorism, foreign espionage, and cyber-warfare. 157 And many of these prosecutions targeted wrongdoing far removed from property theft or quid pro quo bribery. 158 They extend to conduct involving undue influence, breaches of fiduciary duty, or failure to provide citizens with "honest services" 159 - wrongdoing for which the public harm is sometimes hard to identify. 160 [*894] By some accounts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's on occasion, 161 this enforcement agenda has been overly 162 But Congress has generally encouraged far-reaching federal enforcement, notably by expanding the scope of federal anti-corruption law in response to narrow judicial interpretation. 163 And the key point here is that the federal executive Crime Victims are Criticized, Irish Times (Nov. 16, 2015), http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/new-laws-on-rights-of-crime- victims-are-criticised-1.2431095. By contrast, seeSinger v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 34-37 (1965) (holding that due to judicial "confidence in the integrity of the federal prosecutor," U.S. attorneys need not give reasons for refusing to consent to defendant's waiver of jury trial). For rare examples of U.S. rules requiring prosecutors to give reasons for not charging, see Colo. Rev. Stat. § 16-5-209 (2014) (requiring prosecutor's reasons upon private complaint objecting to non-prosecution); Pa. R. Crim. P. 506. 114 Review within the U.S. Justice Department hierarchy is mandated by 18 U.S.C. § 3771(f) (2016); see also id. § 3771(f)(2)(D) (protecting Justice Department decisions from judicial review).

Page 26 of 42 103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *894 branch is firmly committed to a robust enforcement policy against local government corruption that is also criminalized under state law, and Congress has supported this agenda by enacting federal crimes intended to duplicate, or greatly overlap, state offenses. 164 In fact, federal statutes used in anti-corruption cases - [*895] like other federal criminal statutes - rely on and incorporate state law in federal offense definitions. In light of this structure, federal prosecutions can claim to effectuate state law goals - an especially straightforward version of federalism-based enforcement redundancy. 165 2. Sexual Assault In sharp contrast to public corruption, enforcement redundancy through coextensive jurisdiction is largely nonexistent for a large portion of the serious crimes that dominate state felony dockets, including sexual assaults, domestic violence, and homicide. 166 Federal law reaches only a small number of these offenses when they intersect a special basis for federal jurisdiction, such as interstate conduct - like human trafficking - or wrongs that occur on federal property or involve federal 167 For most kinds of homicides, the lack of redundancy is only a modest hindrance to adequate enforcement; holding aside distinctive exceptions - such as homicides by police or racially motivated lynchings - there is little evidence to suggest patterns of homicide underenforcement in state justice systems. 168 Domestic violence and sexual assaults are a different story. Like local public corruption, sexual assaults have long been a key example of [*896] serious wrongdoing to which the responses of state and local criminal justice agencies have been deeply problematic. 169 Underenforcement is hard to measure for sexual assaults as it is in other contexts, but central features of the problem are clear enough. Rape and other forms of sexual assault are dramatically underreported crimes. collect data on sexual assaults (and other crimes), the National Crime Victimization Survey, is widely thought to undercount incidents of those offenses. 171 And rates of victim reports to police departments are even lower. The FBI Uniform Crime Reports collects data on sexual assaults reported to local police agencies; the number is consistently well below the annual number reported in the National Crime Victimization Survey. One reason that victims do not to report rapes to law enforcement is the perception that police and prosecutors (as well as juries) are unduly skeptical of rape allegations. 173 And there is good evidence that law enforcement agencies' responses to 119 See In re Petersen, No. 2:10-CV-298 RM, 2010 WL 5108692, at 2 (N.D. Ind. Dec. 8, 2010) (concluding that prosecutors control charging decisions and certain victim rights under 18 U.S.C. § 377l(a), including the right "to confer with the attorney for the Government in the ….. arise only after charges have been brought against a defendant and a case has been opened," although a "victim's "right to be treated with fairness and with respect for [his or her] dignity and privacy;'... may apply before any prosecution is underway" (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a))); cf. United States v. Rubin, 558 F. Supp. 2d 411, 419 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (assuming without deciding that some federal victim rights may apply before any prosecution is under way, but "cannot be read to include the victims of uncharged crimes that the government has not even contemplated ... [or] has not verified to at least an elementary degree"). 120 Many state laws grant victims a right to consult only "after the crime against the victim has been charged" or "regarding the charges filed." Others create only a general right to confer, or "to communicate," "with the prosecution." E.g., Alaska Const. art. I, § 24 (granting "the right to confer with the prosecution"); Ariz.
