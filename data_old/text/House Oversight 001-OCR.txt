The journalist had confirmed that several prominent names— Mort Zuckerman, the famous real estate mogul and publisher; Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold; and Donald Trump among them-had dined at the residence. She'd interviewed several of Epstein's friends and ex-friends: Nobel Prize-winning scientists, financiers who worked with Epstein at Bear Stearns. She'd handled Steven Hoffenberg with aplomb. And, working with Vanity Fair's editors, she'd figured out ways to slip even more information between the lines, in ways that would allow readers to form their own questions about Epstein's finances. In that respect, she'd fulfilled her original assignment perfectly. What Carter needed to figure out was what to do with the artist, her sister, and their mother's story. But before he could swipe his key card to let himself into the magazine's offices, Car- ter saw a man standing in the reception area. The man was motionless. He'd been waiting for Carter. It was Jeffrey Epstein. Nonplussed, Carter invited him into his office. Epstein denied the claims involving underage women. No crimi- nal charges had been filed. And so Vanity Fair decided not to include the claims in Ward's article. But, according to Ward, when her editor Doug Stumpf called her, she cried. She'd worked so hard on the piece, gotten so stressed out that one of her twins had begun to grow more slowly than the other. On doctor's orders; she'd been put on bed rest. 151 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010494 

JAMES PATTERSON "Why?" she asked when she got to speak to Carter directly. "He's sensitive about the young women. And we still get to run most of the piece." In her notebook, Ward wrote down the rest of what Carter had said: "I believe him," he told her. "I'm Canadian." But the piece that came out, in the March issue, still created a sensation. It was called "The Talented Mr. Epstein" in a sly refer- ence to Patricia Highsmith's celebrated suspense novel The Tal- ented Mr. Ripley. The film adaptation, by Anthony Minghella, was still fresh in the minds of Vanity Fair's readers. For Graydon Carter, just posing the question Is Epstein some sort of scam artist, like Ripley? had been question enough. And throughout the piece, there were ironies readers wouldn't miss as they drew their own conclusions about Epstein's life story. It came through clearly in the first line of the last paragraph of Ward's 7,500-word story: "Many people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein." In context, the word innocent was rather ironic — so much so that it almost became its own opposite. Todd Meister: June 20: H arry Cipriani, on tion.

Located inside the Sherry-Netherland hotel, it's a theme restaurant the theme being money. And today, a hedge-fund manager named Todd Meister is talking about a very wealthy man-Jeffrey Epstein-whom he knows through his father, Epstein's sometime friend Bob Meister. "Tve known Jeffrey since I was nineteen," Meister says. "So let me tell you what I know-whatever everyone knows and everybody else says. First off, he's no billionaire. Second off— and here's why— he has no clue how to invest. He has people do that for him." Meister knows how to invest. He does it for other people and, as the son of a superrich father, for himself. He also knows about the 153 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010496 

JAMES PATTERSON good life. Parties in Vegas; weekends in the Hamptons; affairs with beautiful women that end up getting splashed all over the tabloids. It makes sense that, once upon a time, he and Epstein would have gotten along "As for the girls," Meister says, "that was just business. He'd seat them strategically at client dinners. When he went to the movies, he'd take three or four girls with him. They'd take turns massaging his back, arms, and legs." According to Meister, Epstein used to boast that he "liked to go into insane asylums because he liked to fuck crazy women." "Who knows if it's true?" Meister adds. "But I'm telling you, he used to say it." From time to time, Epstein's friends and acquaintances would see sides of Epstein that he'd grown much less shy about sharing. Epstein encouraged Alan Dershowitz to invest with a prominent hedge-fund manager named Orin Kramer. Dershowitz did, and he made a lot of money at first. But in 2008, the fund Dershowitz had invested in lost a substantial amount. Afterward, according to a for- mer associate of Epstein's, Epstein appeared in Kramer's midtown Manhattan office. There, sources say, he told Kramer: "It's very much in your interest to make Alan Dershowitz whole." Epstein's intervention worked, and Dershowitz recovered his money. To people who'd known Epstein back in the 1980s, this kind of behavior was out of character. But the thing about Epstein was that you never could figure him out. One minute he was charming. 154 FILT The most charming man youd threat, and bluster.

So you'd run the numbers: this many parties, that many women. Even with the connection to Victoria's Secret, the women didn't add up, either. Throw in the modeling agency, it makes more sense. Then you plug in the parties. The scene brings Eyes Wide Shut to mind. But the thing is, Eyes Wide Shut only works in the shadows. For Epstein, getting on that plane with Clinton was more like a moment in Caddyshack— the one in which the groundhog peeks out from his hole in the golf course. From there on in, Jeffrey Epstein was like the mole in a game of whack-a-mole. It was only a matter of time before he'd be caught. But the question you had to ask yourself was, are people like Epstein born without mor- als? Or are their morals like snakeskin —just something they shed (along with all the other basic, day-to-day concerns that everyday working people have as they make their way into that Eyes Wide Shut world? Todd Meister, who was married to Nicky Hilton and stole the heiress Samantha Boardman away from Condé Nast's former editorial director James Truman, should know. He wonders out loud: "How does a yutz like Epstein get beautiful women?" At Harry Cipriani, the question lingers in the air. 155 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010498 

PART IV The Investigation HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010499 

CHAPTER 40 Michael Reiter: January 2006 s far as Michael Reiter's concerned, the case that his team A has built against Epstein-slowly, meticulously, over the Lcourse of an entire year—is airtight. Even now, Detective Recarey's finding new pieces of evidence. And already Reiter's been laying the groundwork with prosecutors. State attorney Barry Krischer has a reputation for toughness. He's known, nationally, for his prosecution of juvenile offenders. And Reiter's been keeping him abreast of the investigation. With Jeffrey Epstein, it's not simply a matter of seeing him punished. It's a matter of getting a sexual predator off the streets of Palm Beach. Krischer assures the chief that he's taking this case very seriously. The state attorney's office will have Reiter's back at every turn. "I told him that we had an investigation that was very serious 159 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010500 

JAMES PATTERSON that involved a very noteworthy person and that involved a num- ber of underage females," Reiter would say in his deposition for the suit that was later settled by Epstein. That it was of a sexual nature. I was concerned that we had not reached all of the vic- tims, and we hadn't, I'm sure, at this point. I told him that I felt like the suspect would probably become aware of the investiga- tion at some point and that we should probably expect some con- tact from.. Mr. Epstein's lawyers. And I told him that I wanted to keep him very well informed on this and that I hoped that he would do the same. And that we would have to have more con- tact in making sure it was handled responsibly, intelligently, and appropriately as it moved forward." Reiter would say that Epstein's name did not seem to ring a bell with the state attorney. But shortly afterward, the chief became aware that in certain powerful circles his investigation was being looked upon unfavorably. "I had many people-related conversations... on the cocktail-party circuit that suggested we approach this in a way that wasn't necessary," he would say. Michael Reiter was a good cop. A good man. But he was about to discover that when it came to men with the power and influ- ence Epstein wielded, fairness under the law was a relative, mal- leable concept.

Ultimately, according to a source within the Palm Beach PD, the department would identify forty-seven underage girls who'd been molested on El Brillo Way. Recarey interviewed one of Epstein's pilots, a man named David Rogers, as well as Epstein's houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. He also spoke to a woman who really was a massage therapist. It turned out that Epstein paid just one hundred dollars for actual Swedish deep-tissue massages that the therapist provided for him and his friends, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz among them. Did anything untoward ever happen? Recarey asked. Had Epstein ever asked the woman to rub his chest? 161 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010502 

JAMES PATTERSON No, she told him. She wasn't Epstein's type. The girls she'd seen at his house were very thin and beautiful and did not have tattoos. This massage therapist had several tattoos that were vis- ible, and on quite a few occasions Epstein and Ghislaine Max- well had made negative comments about them. According to a Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report filed by Recarey on July 25, 2006, the detective had also heard from Mary's father, who said that a private eye had been to his house, photographing his family and chasing visitors away.

Recarey informed the state's attorney's office. Alison also contacted Recarey and told him that shed been approached by someone who was in touch with Epstein. Alison had been told that she'd receive money if she would refuse to cooperate with the police. Those who help him will be compensated, she was told, according to Detective Recarey's incident report. "And those who hurt him will be dealt with." Recarey reassured the girl and told her that tampering with a witness in a case like this was a serious, arrestable offense.

Elected twice to his office, in 1992 and 1996, he had run unopposed for state attorney in 2000 and 2004. During the course of his long career, which began in 1970 with a three-year stint in the district attorney's office in Brooklyn, he received a number of awards: the pro bono award from the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County for his service with the juvenile justice system and for his work with the child protection team; the Peace at Home award, presented by Gover- nor Jeb Bush, for his work with victims of family violence; a life- time achievement award from the Florida Bar. He was a board member of the National District Attorneys Association. And he was not necessarily averse to going after the rich and powerful. In 2003, he launched an investigation into Rush Limbaugh's use 163 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010504 

JAMES PATTERSON of, and means of obtaining, oxycodone and hydrocodone. (A few years after Limbaugh's arrest, which coincided with Chief Reit- er's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the talk-show host settled with prosecutors, agreed to submit to random drug testing, and gave up his firearms permit.) Krischer himself, however, had been accused of sexual misconduct. In October of 1992, Jodi Bergeron, a legal secretary who'd worked for Krischer, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him in the Palm Beach County circuit court. That suit was dismissed, but a few months later, the woman took Krischer to federal court, accusing him of making unwanted advances and demanding recompense for battery, negligence, invasion of privacy, and emotional distress. Krischer had placed his hands, violently, inside her blouse, the woman said. He'd forcibly fondled her breasts, forcibly kissed her, and rubbed her shoulders while brushing her buttocks with his hands and knees, all while accompanying the gestures with verbal advances. When she declined those advances, the woman claimed, Krischer fired her. Krischer denied the allegations. At the time, he was making his first run for the state attorney's office. The charges were politically motivated, he said. Members of a local chapter of NOW-the National Organization for Women—had stood by the lawyer, cit- ing his efforts to stop domestic violence, among his other virtues. "I am here to support Barry Krischer for the work his office did in my daughter's case," one woman said during a rally that took place in front of the courthouse. "Her murderer received the maximum sentence, a life sentence."

"Her murderer received sentence." o been dismissed —after Krischer's 164 FILTHY RICH former law firm agreed to pay Bergeron's attorney seven thou- sand dollars in legal fees. Now Chief Reiter and Detective Recarey were beginning to have their own questions about Barry Krischer. The Palm Beach PD wanted to charge Epstein with one count of lewd and lascivious behavior and four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor-felony charges that would have amounted to years behind bars in the case of a conviction. Wendy Dobbs and Sarah Kellen would be charged as accomplices. This was not the plan that Krischer seemed to have in mind for Jeffrey Epstein. In cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, prosecuting attorneys tend to have suspects arrested, then push for a trial But instead of granting his approval for an arrest, Krischer told the police that he would convene a grand jury, which would be asked to consider a broad range of charges. In a case such as Epstein's, this was highly unusual. Not damn- ing in and of itself. But very strange. In Florida, grand juries are only required in capital cases. At the state attorney's discretion, they may also be called in controversial cases-for instance, cases involving crimes committed by public officials. But Jeffrey Epstein wasn't a public official, and as far as the Palm Beach PD was con- cerned, the only controversial thing about the case they'd built was that Epstein was rich and well connected. In his deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein, Chief Reiter rel ayed Krischer's concerns: the pros- ecutor had to make sure that his case was solid, beyond a reason- able doubt. And Krischer did have his doubts about the credibility of the young women who'd be called to testify against Epstein. 165 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010506 

JAMES PATTERSON Even so, Reiter was beginning to wonder if Krischer was stacking the deck in Epstein's favor-if, thanks to the sway prosecutors have over grand juries, assembling such a jury wasn't an excellent way to let Epstein off with the lightest pun- ishment possible. Another unusual thing: the way Barry Krischer and the law- yers working for him ignored Chief Reiter's multiple phone calls as well as Detective Recarey's —even though the police had been hearing from Epstein's own lawyers. "[Krischer] and I had an excellent relationship," Chief Reiter said in his deposition. "I was the speaker at his swearing-in cere- mony. And that he wouldn't return my phone calls-—I mean, it was clear to me by his actions that he could not objectively look at this case." Palm Beach Police Depar by Detective Joseph Reca In the incident report he ended up writing, Detective Recarey remembered a phone call that he received from Guy Frostin, one of the lawyers representing Epstein. It was a message Epstein wanted to send, something central to the case that demanded explanation. The whole shit show swirling around him was just a misunderstanding—a misrepresentation— of Epstein's actual interests and intentions. Fronstin says Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages, Detective Recarey would write. And: Mr. Epstein had donated over $100,000 to the Ballet of Florida for massages. And: The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for him. That is why he has had so many massages.

Messages were left on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am and 11:30 am I again left messages for ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavek for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury. At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attor- ney's Office and Located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavek in their offices. I entered ASA Belohlavek's office who informed me that she was going to return my call. She explained that an offer was made to the Defense, Atty Guy Fronstin and 167 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010508 

JAMES PATTERSON Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to psy- chiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with minors. When asked about all the other victims, ASA Belohlavek stated that was the only offer made as to one vic- tim, [Maryl. ASA Belohlavek['s] cell phone rang and went to voice mail. She checked her voice mail and played the mes- sage on speaker. The caller identified himself as Atty Guy Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them. Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jef- frey Epstein, and would agree to this deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavek stated a probable cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county Jail and would let me know as to when it was needed. I explained my disapproval of the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered. However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief Reiter call Barry Krischer about the deal. I left the area and returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the deal offered. I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a mes- sage from [the] stepmother for the victim [Mary]. She was calling because the State Attorney's Office still had not returned any of her calls as to when they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavek's office and left messages for her to call the victims on this case and explain to them what the State Attorney's Office had done. Michael Reiter: May 2( A plea offer?

Chief Reiter is outraged. His team has logged thou- sands of hours of work. They've assembled mountains of evidence. But instead of going to trial, the state attorney wants to see Epstein get off with a misdemeanor, five years of probation, and a psych exam. Why? Alan Dershowitz has presented the prosecutors with his own pieces of evidence — printouts from the victims' Myspace pages. In her "About Me" column, under "Best physical feature," Mary has written "Ass and eyes." Under "Ever drank" and "Ever smoked pot," she's written "Yeah." Under "Ever shoplifted". "Lots." Under "Ever skinny dipped". "Yeah." 169 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010510 

JAMES PATTERSON Under "[Do] you wanna lose your virginity". "I already lost it." One of the victims has been caught with drugs and arrested. She's also been caught stealing from Victoria's Secret. From the state attorney's perspective, these girls look like compromised women. And if what they say about Epstein is true, wouldn't that make them prostitutes? As witnesses, they would be weak, while the lawyers on Epstein's side were exceptionally strong Alan Dershowitz had represented Claus von Bülow, the Brit- ish socialite who was acquitted of the murder of his wife, Sunny. Dershowitz had been on O. J. Simpson's team when the former football star was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and Nicole's friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. And rich as von Bülow and Simpson had been, neither one had had the resources that Epstein was willing and able to deploy in his own defense. Neither of them had been intimate friends with his lawyer. As far as Reiter was concerned, none of that mattered. Even if Epstein thought that the girls he'd molested were eighteen years old—even if they had lied to him—it didn't matter under Flor- ida law. The chief grew worried that in Epstein's case exceptions were being made, and he grew even more concerned with each unreturned call that he made to the state attorney's office. On May 1, the Palm Beach PD asked the state attorney's office to issue an arrest warrant for Jeffrey Epstein. That same day, Chief Reiter took the extraordinary step of writing Barry Krischer a letter all but demanding that he recuse himself from the case.

A: Well, I felt the handling—and just continued to feel that the way the state attorney's office handled this case was extremely unusual. I knew that Mr. Krischer was making decisions about this case. I felt that his objectivity was lacking, and I felt that the appropriate way, after reading the statute that governed the assignment of cases to other circuits—I felt that his action met the standard. I used some of the words from the statute in here. And I attempted to call him, and he wouldn't return my phone calls. The detective attempted to contact-his contact in the state attorney's office, Lanna Belohlavek, however you pro- nounce that... and she wouldn't return his calls. So I wrote the letter in hope that he would think about his situation and realize that his objectivity was insufficient to prosecute the case and ask the governor to appoint someone else. And I felt like that was necessary for a fair prosecution of our case that had been submitted to him. Q: Could you tell us, explain to us, why you felt that his objec- tivity may be lacking in regards to this prosecution...? In other words, what evidence did you see here, uncover, that you felt made it potentially nonobjective? A: Well.... when I first told him about the case, and I realized that it was a serious case, [that] there were multiple victims, land] that the suspect was very well known, I told him about it. And we were—it was in person. I talked to him after a meeting that he and I were both involved in. And I had known him to be a victim advocate and to protect the rights of children. Well, I know that he even wrote a portion of the statute that addresses those issues. And when I told him 173 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010514 

JAMES PATTERSON originally, he said, "Let's go for it; this is an adult male in his fifties who's had sexual contact with children of the ages of the victims." He said this is somebody who we have to stop. And whatever we need, he said, in the state attorney's office, we have a unit that's equipped to investigate and prosecute these kinds of cases. And I didn't have too many facts early on when I talked with him, but I knew that there were multi- ple victims and to our detectives they were believable. So when time went on and Mr. Epstein became aware of the investigation and his lawyers contacted the state attorney's office, they told me that. And from that point on, and I believe it was Mr. Dershow- itz initially, the tone and tenor of the discussions of this case with Mr. Krischer changed completely. [At] one point he sug- gested that we write [Epstein] a notice to appear, which would be for a misdemeanor. He just completely changed from not only our first conversation about this! — when] he didn't know. the name Jeffrey Epstein-till when he had been informed on Mr. Epstein's reputation and his wealth, and I just thought that very unusual. I feel like I know him or knew him very well, the state attorney, and I just felt like he could not objectively make decisions about this case: that is why I wrote it.

No arrest warrant was issued. And on the afternoon of May 3, Detec- tive Recarey received a telephone call from assistant state attor- ney Daliah Weiss, who advised him that she had been taken off the Epstein case. Weiss had been the perfect person to prosecute Epstein. As a member of the special victims unit, she focused on sex crimes and crimes against children, prosecuting high-profile cases involv- ing rape, aggravated child abuse, and neglect. But Epstein had added another lawyer, a man named Jack Goldberger, and made Goldberger his attorney of record. •Goldberger was friendly with Barry Krischer —and an asso- ciate of Goldberger's was married to Daliah Weiss. 175 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010516 

JAMES PATTERSON If Epstein's legal team had wanted to remove Weiss from the case, this would have been a good way to do it. Nine days later, Detective Recarey met with ASA Lanna Belohlavek, who told him that her boss, Barry Krischer, had asked her again to take the case to the grand jury. Recarey told Belohlavek that he had already requested arrest warrants for Epstein, Sarah Kel- len, and Wendy Dobbs. The Palm Beach PD had finished its investi- gation months earlier, he said, and had been waiting since then for the case to move forward. He asked her once more to issue the war- rants. Once again Belohlavek declined, saying that the original offer her office had made to Epstein's old lawyer had been resubmitted to the new lawyer. When Epstein's reply came, she would call. While waiting for that call, Recarey received several calls from Mary's father, who told him that he was being followed by a green Chevrolet Monte Carlo —tailed so aggressively that other vehicles were being run off the road. Recarey ran the plates and found that the Chevy was registered to one Zachary Bechard of Jupiter, Florida. Bechard was a licensed private eye. "A funny thing happened in Palm Beach," says Tim Malloy, who was working as a TV newscaster in South Florida at the time. "This would have been right around the time that Michael Reiter sent his letter asking Barry Krischer to recuse himself from the case. I didn't even know what Epstein looked like, really, at the time. We had pictures taken by the British tabloids, where the link to Prince Andrew first broke. But we didn't have too many of them.

So thanks to him, we had the 727's tail number, and thanks to one other source- someone I won't say too much about here—we had Epstein's flight plan for a certain trip he was making. We knew he was going to land at the airport. And so our producer climbed into the station's traffic helicopter and told the pilot to hover at five hundred feet a quarter mile south of the field "Our cameraman had a telephoto lens. The idea was to get a tight shot, on video, of Epstein deplaning. And for a moment we did get the shot: Epstein, with the collar of his cashmere coat flipped up over his neck, about to run down the steps into a cart that was waiting for him. "Then he saw our helicopter, with the station's markings. "I was doing a live voice-over on Epstein's arrival. It was the first video anyone had on him up to that point. But Epstein had run back onto the plane. Then, during the next commercial break, my producer told me through my headpiece: Jeffrey Epstein wants us to stop taking his picture. In fact, he wants to talk to you? "The cameraman kept rolling. And eventually Epstein got out, got into a car with tinted windows, and was driven over the 177 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010518 

JAMES PATTERSON bridge to his home in Palm Beach. So in a sense we failed to get the story. But the fact that Epstein would call a news program from his plane and command them to order the program's traffic helicopter away —that says something about the man's arro- gance.

JAMES PATTERSON gotten into more fights there, growing depressed and withdrawn from her sister and parents. Helplessly, her parents watched her spiral out of control. As they neared the end of their rope, they sent her out of state. But after the move, Mary had fallen apart completely. She used drugs, fell in with a bad crowd, ran away from her relatives, and shacked up with a gang of drug dealers. When the gang was busted by local police, the dealers blamed Mary for snitching and put out the word that they wanted her dead "We had to move her again," Mary's father explained. "We finally got her into therapy — she's still seeing the therapist. And worst of all, she developed HPV. She's already had to have a seri- ous operation." Mary's troubles didn't end there. On June 28, she was brought in front of the grand jury. She hadn't been briefed by the state attorney—she hadn't even met the prosecutors-and she had no idea what she would be asked. Almost immediately, she found that she was being treated more like a criminal than like a witness or victim. "The prosecutor produced a printout of our daughter's Myspace page," Mary's father recalls. "Mary was stunned. She began to cry. The prosecutor accused her of all sort of things; it was like she was working for Epstein. "All this time, we knew that we were being watched. Creepy guys. Private investigators from Miami. They would follow us, scaring the hell out of my wife and Mary's sister. My car was van- dalized. It was like living in hell." •By this point, Epstein's defense dream team included Jack Goldberger, Alan Dershowitz, and Gerald Lefcourt. All of them had excellent track records.

Now the grand jury was recom mending that Epstein be charged with just one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. There was no mention of underage girls. The original accusation — four felony counts of unlawful sex acts with minors and one felony count of lewd and lascivious molestation - had simply evaporated. It wasn't enough to send Epstein to prison. Epstein was allowed to surrender on a Sunday, when no one would know he'd been arraigned. A few hours later, he was released on three thousand dollars bail.

So much so that he took the extraordinary step of calling the FBI and the federal prosecutor's office. At the time, the federal prosecutor of the Southern District of Florida was a Republican named R. Alexander Acosta. Chief Reiter recalls being present at Acosta's swearing-in ceremony and remembers Acosta's declaration that one of his goals would be the prosecution, to the fullest extent of the law, of anyone who takes advantage of the weak-especially perpetrators of sex crimes. Disgusted with Krischer's laissez-faire attitude, Reiter recalls thinking he'd found his man. In Acosta, the chief saw a prosecutor who wouldn't shy away from confronting a man with Jeffrey Epstein's resources and connections. But it turned out that Acosta had worked under Ken Starr at Starr's high-powered multinational law firm, Kirkland & Ellis. And while Acosta had a sterling résumé, which included a stint clerking for future Supreme Court justice Samuél Alito, he had only argued two cases before a judge. At the time, Reiter did not know this. All he knew was that some- one had to look much more seriously into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. Reiter's actions did not necessarily make him a hero—at least, not in every corner of the community he served. "I had individuals suggest that the department's approach to the investigation and my referral of the investigation to the FBI was more horsepower than the investigation deserved. And I had other individuals suggest that—yeah, the term "back off' probably fits," Reiter said in his deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein. 183 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010524 

JAMES PATTERSON "I had people in the community in Palm Beach who either made comments directly to me or to others who relayed them to me that I didn't need to take the tack in the investigation that we did, which is [to] completely investigate it and then refer it to the FBI after the state case was resolved," Reiter said in the deposition. "I had one individual who came to see me a couple of times about this." According to the chief, the individual in question was a prominent Palm Beach politician. "He said this wasn't necessary; this was a case that was really very minor," Reiter recalled. "The victims had lifestyles that don't make them —shouldn't make them believable to the police department." "I told him that those kinds of suggestions to me were improper and he should stop," said Reiter. "That he had taken a couple of steps down the road toward something that could eventually constitute a crime. We talked several times. Early on it didn't end favorably. You know, this is an individual [whom] I had to interact with in my official capacity and in his official capacity as well." The Palm Beach politician wasn't the only one to pressure the police chief. "I received comments from a variety of different viewpoints... in some cases I had people tell me, hey, he's a Palm Beacher, why are you investigating a Palm Beacher?" Reiter would say when deposed. "I had people that said it was an unfa- vorable career move for me to ask the state attorney to remove himself from the case and to refer it to the FBI....I had plenty of people that told me that that was a mistake." Reiter didn't back off. To have done so would have been a betrayal— not only of the victims but also of his vocation and the community he had sworn he would serve. 184 FIL: "My responsibility was to Beach and preserve their con: department for all," Reiter sai particularly under the crimin the nature of our system, be ti But along with handing t attorney, Reiter took another letters-on Palm Beach PD victims in the case.

"And I think that under the law, particularly under the criminal laws, that all people have to, by the nature of our system, be treated exactly alike." But along with handing the case off to the FBI and the US attorney, Reiter took another unusual step. He wrote personal letters —on Palm Beach PD letterhead—to the parents of the victims in the case. He delivered the letters by hand. 184 185 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010526

But nothing about Jeffrey Epstein was regular- and the plea deal he managed to strike in 2007 was simply extraordinary. Epstein had bought himself one of the best defense teams ever assembled. His connections and contributions to Democratic 187 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010528 

JAMES PATTERSON causes had made him a player on that side of the political aisle. He had a famous Republican, Bill Clinton's nemesis, Ken Starr, work- ing the other side. And just to make sure they'd covered the bases, Epstein's team also recruited Roy Black—the lawyer whơ'd cleared William Kennedy Smith of rape and kept Rush Limbaugh out of prison for his alleged illegal drug use—and Jay Lefkowitz, a defense attorney who'd worked with US attorney R. Alexander Acosta at Ken Starr's law firm. And so in September, the US attorney's office reached a for- mal agreement with Epstein's team: the United States would defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the state of Florida. A non-prosecution agreement (NPA) was drafted; among other things, it assured Epstein that he would not be prosecuted in the Southern District of Florida for felony offenses involving the sexual abuse of underage girls. (By that point, thirty known victims had been discovered.) Instead it allowed him to plead guilty to state felony offenses for solicitation of prostitution and the procurement of minors for prostitution. The NPA established a procedure that allowed Epstein's victims to sue him in civil court and took the extraordinary step of ensuring that "any potential co-conspirators" of Epstein's would be immune from prosecution. "In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspira- tors of Epstein," the agreement stated, mentioning Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova by name. 188 FILT "The parties anticipate tha part of any public record," 1 United States receives a Freed any compulsory process comm ment, it will provide notice disclosure."

Remarkably, despite assurances they'd received from the feds, none of the victims was consulted prior to the drafting of this NPA. If Epstein did not sign the agreement, he faced a fifty-seven- count indictment and a decade or more in prison. But Epstein's team of lawyers had gotten him a deal so sweet it could have rot- ted all the teeth in South Florida. For all his protestations of innocence, there was every reason in the world to agree to an NPA. On September 24, 2007, Epstein did sign it.

CHAPTER 50 Jane Doe: February 2008 s a result of the non-prosecution agreement, a fifty-three- A count indictment that federal prosecutors had prepared Lagainst Jeffrey Epstein—one that claimed he'd abused dozens of underage women — never was filed But as far as lawyers representing Epstein's victims were con- cerned, the fact that those victims were not consulted about the non-prosecution agreement was inexcusable. The "government deliberately kept crime victims 'in the dark' so that it could enter into a plea arrangement designed to prevent the victims from raising any objections," they would argue, in documents filed on February 10, 2016. For nine months, the lawyers claimed, from the time that the NPA was signed, on September 24, 2007, Krischer's office, "doing Epstein's bidding, [had] concealed the NPA's existence from victims]" and continued to do so until the moment that Epstein had finally did June 30, 2008.

In the interim, according to their lawyers, Epstein's victims were only told, "This case is currently under investigation." A lawsuit that Bradley Edwards, a victims' rights attorney in Fort Lauderdale, filed in July of 2008 cited the Crime Victims' Rights Act, or CVRA (title 18, section 3771, of the US Code), which states that "victims of federal crimes have rights, includ- ing the right to be heard in court, and most particularly, not to be precluded from court proceedings, and the right to be treated fairly." According to him, prosecutors had violated the CVRA rights of the victims. Edwards, who said he was working pro bono, knew that this suit against the government would not allow for monetary recovery of any sort (including lawyers' fees). But he also knew that if the government, urged by Jeffrey Epstein, had entered into a contract that improperly or illegally violated the rights of Epstein's victims, then that contract, by nature, would have been improper in and of itself— in which case, the only remedy would have been to have the contract invalidated. And while it is difficult to know what, exactly, would happen if the contract is overturned, one possibility is that the government could prosecute Epstein for crimes against his victims, if the statute of limitations on those crimes has not expired. At the time of this writing, that case is winding its way through the courts. It has all the earmarks of a modern-day Bleak House-the Charles Dickens novel about a legal case that is so massive and so complex that it drags on forever and drags everyone involved into the mire. 191 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010532 

JAMES PATTERSON * ** In the meantime, Epstein began to settle out of court with his victims. In February of 2008, a Virginia woman who went by the alias Jane Doe #2 brought a fifty-million-dollar lawsuit against Epstein. At the time of their meeting, she claimed, Epstein was fifty-two years old. She was a teenager, and her complaint, which was made public, gave the rest of the world an early glimpse of what Epstein, and the inner workings of his secret world, looked like from a victim's perspective. "Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret cli- entele limited exclusively to billionaires," the lawsuit alleged. "He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influ- ence. He maintains his principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach." The complaint continued: Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily economi- cally disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. In or about 2004-2005, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims. Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his schemes and assaulted girls in Florida, New York, and on his private Island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. Epstein's scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit 192 F: underage girls. (Upon inf who brought Jane Doe to of Epstein, and will ther plaint.)

(Upon information and belief, the young girl who brought Jane Doe to Epstein was herself a minor victim of Epstein, and will therefore not be named in this Com- plaint.) Under Epstein's plan, underage girls were recruited ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. The recruiter would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf would direct the recruiter to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. The recruiter, upon information and belief, generally sought out economically disadvantaged underaged girls from western Palm Beach County who would be enticed by the money being offered-generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session — and who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. Epstein's plan reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at Epstein's mansion, the underaged victim would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to other furnishings. There were photo- graphs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the bedroom. The girl would then find herself alone in the room with Epstein, who would be wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel and lie naked on the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. Epstein would then 193 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010534 

JAMES PATTERSON perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe was recruited to give Epstein a massage for monetary com- pensation. Jane was brought to Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach. Once at the mansion, Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. In this room, Epstein told Jane to take off her clothes and give him a massage. Jane kept her panties and bra on and complied with Epstein's instructions. Epstein wore only a towel around his waste [sic]. After a short period of time, Epstein removed the towel and rolled over exposing his penis. Epstein began to masturbate and he sexually assaulted Jane. • After Epstein had completed the assault, Jane was then able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. The young girl who recruited Jane was paid $100 by Epstein for bringing Jane to him. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experi- enced confusion, shame, humiliation and embarrassment, and has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries. 194 Jeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2 n June 30, 2008, more Officer Pagan's investig age girls, Jeffrey Epsti County jail.
