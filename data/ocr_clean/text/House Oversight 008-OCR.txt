6. RISK FACTORS Investment in the Units involves a substantial degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. As a result, the purchase of the Units should be considered only by persons who can reasonably afford a loss of their entire investment. Prospective investors should carefully consider, in addition to matters set forth elsewhere in this Memorandum, the following factors relating to the business of the Company and this offering. The order in which risk factors appear is not intended as an indication of the relative weight or importance thereof. Prospective investors should carefully review all risk factors. Such information is presented as of the date hereof and is subject to change without notice. The discussion in this Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. occurrence of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations or cash flow. Risks described herein that could affect KLC are also likely to be similar for other pre-K-12 businesses we may acquire or develop. Other businesses we acquire or develop in foreign countries or in different markets, may be subject to risks in addition to those discussed below. 6.1. Risks Related to Our Business 6.1.1 Risks associated with growth through acquisitions; potential inability to consummate transactions A principal component of the Company's growth strategy is the acquisition of other businesses or interests therein that will complement and/or expand the Company's businesses and the products and services that they offer. The successful implementation of this strategy will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, consummate such transactions on favorable terms and integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the Company. Identifying, completing and realizing on attractive acquisitions are highly competitive and involves a high degree of uncertainty. The Company will be competing for acquisitions with other companies, private equity firms, as well as individuals and others, which often results in increased acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or that if identified, the Company will be able to consummate such transactions on suitable terms, or that acquired businesses will perform as expected or generate returns. In addition to risks facing education companies similar to those facing KLC as described herein, acquisitions of businesses also involve special risks, including risks associated with unanticipated labilities and contingencies, diversion of Company management attention and possible adverse effect on earnings resulting from increased amortization of goodwill, increased interest costs, the issuance o additional securities and difficulties related to the integration of the acquired business. No assurance can be given as to the success of the Company in executing and integrating acquisitions in the future. The Company's failure or inability to successfully implement and manage its acquisition strategy would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business. The Company may from time to time enter into negotiations in anticipation of consummating an acquisition transaction. However, there is no assurance that such negotiations will be successful and the diversion of management attention on such unsuccessful transactions may adversely affect management's ability to pursue other business opportunities. In addition, KLC PropCo intends to acquire diversified real estate interests, including investments in non- education related properties. The performance of this acquisition strategy in general, or of any particular property, cannot be predicted 44 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024477

The initial closing of this offering will require a minimum investment (including the amount attributable to KUE LLC through conversion of its preferred limited partner units, including accrued dividends at the option of KUE LLC, into Common LP Units) of U.S. $280.0 million. There can be no assurance of additional closings after the initial closing of the offering, whether before the completion of the Offering Period on March 31, 2007 or thereafter. Unless there are subsequent closings or offerings, cash available for acquisitions and expansion would be limited to available cash of KLC and KUE and proceeds of future financings of KLC and KUE. 6.1.2 The Company plans to acquire or invest in non-U.S. companies. This international expansion strategy is untested, and may include acquisitions or developments in countries where for-profit education is not well established Foreign acquisitions involve certain risks not typically associated with U.S. acquisitions, including risks relating to (i) currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the various foreign currencies in which the Company's non-U.S. interests are denominated, and costs associated with conversion from one currency into another; (ii) differences between the U.S. and foreign securities markets, including potential price volatility in and relative illiquidity of some foreign securities markets, the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards and disclosure requirements and less governmental supervision and regulation; (i) certain economic and political risks, including potential restrictions on foreign acquisition and repatriation of capital, and the risks of political, economic or social instability and the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; (iv) the possible imposition of foreign taxes on income and gains; and (v) differences in applicable legal systems, including the possibility that the Company may experience difficulty in asserting legal claims or obtaining legal remedies against sellers of businesses in foreign jurisdictions. The Company's prior operating history is limited to its U.S.-based businesses. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance outside the U.S. The Company's non-U.S. businesses may operate in countries in which the legal and regulatory frameworks, customary business models, education practices and philosophies and political and social norms are substantially different from those in the U.S. International expansion may also involve significant market risks, and opportunities to realize synergies may be limited. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its international expansion strategy. In addition, the Company may acquire businesses or pursue business development opportunities in countries where for-profit education is not well-established, which may involve greater risks than those associated with similar U.S. acquisitions and developments. For example, the performance of a for-profit education company located in a country where for-profit education is in an embryonic stage may be volatile. Such a company also may be unable to achieve the growth or success achieved by education businesses in countries, such as the U.S., where for-profit education is more established. In addition, there can be no assurance that for-profit education will ever become well-established or maintain viability n any given country. If any of the above events occur, the Company may suffer a partial or total loss o capital invested in that business or development The Company's success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled employees The success of the Company will depend in part on continued employment of senior management and other key personnel, particularly the Principals. See the discussion under the heading "The Company may not engage in certain businesses" below. If one or more senior management or key personnel ecome unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, the business and operations of the The success of the Company also depends on attracting and retaining highly trained financial, marketing and other personnel. The Company will need to continue to hire additional personnel as its business grows. The market for hiring such personnel is competitive and hiring such personnel may require increased salaries and enhanced benefits under certain circumstances. A shortage in the number of 45 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024478

skilled personnel could limit the ability of the Company to increase sales of existing products and services and launch new product offerings. 6.1.4 The Company has significant leverage, and expects to incur additional debt, which could result in adverse effects on its financial condition The Company has significant leverage and expects to incur additional debt in connection with the acquisition and operation of its businesses. Although the Company intends to use leverage in a manner it believes to be prudent, the leveraged capital structure the Company plans to utilize may significantly increase the Company's exposure to adverse economic factors such as rising interest rates. downturns in the economy or deteriorations in the condition of the businesses or their respective industries. If a business cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet debt obligations, the Company may suffer a partial or total loss of capital invested in such business. The Company's ability to service its substantial indebtedness, and meet its other obligations depends on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are outside the Company's control. The Company cannot be certain that its cash flow will be sufficient for such purposes. If the Company does not have enough liquidity, it may be required to all or part of its existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, may restrict the Company from pursuing any of these alternatives. The substantial level of indebtedness incurred by the Company may have the following consequences of potential concern to investors in the Company: • The Company must use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on its indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures; • The Company's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired; • The Company may be limited in its ability to borrow additional funds; • The Company may have a higher level of indebtedness than some of its competitors, which may put it at a competitive disadvantage and reduce its flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in its industry, including increased competition; and • The Company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments than it would without the leverage. Adverse developments in the Company's financial condition would have adverse effects upon the business and results of the Company as a whole. 6.1.5 The Company faces intense competition in the early childhood care and education services industry from numerous other types of providers The early childhood care and education services industry is competitive and highly fragmented. The most important competitive factors generally are quality, convenience and, to a lesser extent, price. The Company's, specifically KLC OpCo's, competition in this industry consists principally of: • other for-profit, center-based child care providers, including franchise organizations; preschool, kindergarten and before and after school programs provided by public schools; HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024479

• local nursery schools and child care centers, including church-affiliated and other non-profit centers; • providers of child care services that operate out of homes; and • substitutes for group child care, such as relatives, nannies and stay-at-home parents. 1 many markets, the Company faces competition from preschool services and before and after schoc rograms offered by public schools that provide such services at little or no cost to parents. The numbe of school districts offering these services is growing, and we expect increased competition from such services in the future. In addition, local nursery schools, child care centers and in-home providers generally charge less for their services than the Company. Many denominational and other non-profit child care centers have lower operating expenses than the Company and may receive donations and/o other funding to subsidize operating expenses. Consequently, operators of such centers often charge lower tuition rates than us. Moreover, fees for home-based care are normally substantially lower than fees for center-based care. 6.1.6 The Company may acquire companies that are not well-established or are experiencing financial difficulties The Company may acquire less established companies. Acquisitions of interests in such companies may involve greater risks than are generally associated with acquisitions of more established or stable companies. For example, such companies may have shorter operating histories on which to predict future performance and may have negative cash flow. Their performance may be more volatile and they may be unable to sustain the growth rates or success achieved by established companies. In the case of start-up enterprises, such companies may not have significant or any operating revenues. companies also may have a lower capitalization and fewer resources (including cash) and may be more vulnerable to failure, resulting in the loss of the Company's entire investment in such company. In addition, less mature companies could be more susceptible to irregular accounting or other fraudulent practices. In such event, the Company may suffer a partial or total loss of capital invested in that company. The Company has invested in troubled companies in the past, and may make future investments in companies that are experiencing, or are expected to experience, financial difficulties. If such difficulties are not overcome, the Company may lose part or all of any equity investment in such companies. 6.1.7 KUE will rely on the management teams of its subsidiaries While KUE will retain overall control and set the strategic direction of the Company, day-to-day operations at the subsidiary level will be the responsibility of the management teams at the subsidiary level. There can be no assurance that the existing management teams, or any successor, of any acquired business will be able to operate such business in accordance with KUE's plans and/or objectives. 6.1.8 The Company has a non-controlling interest in k12 with limited rights as a shareholder and may acquire minority interests in other entities The Company holds a non-controlling interest in k12 and may in the future acquire minority interests in other companies. Holding a minority interest limits the Company's ability to protect its interests in and to influence management of k12. Any future investments in minority interests of other companies will likely involve similar limitations. Coment neur as is congan at an and on eating managemen era beat directors of such companies, which may include representatives of other investors with whom the Company is not affiliated and whose interests may at times conflict with the interests of the Company. 47 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024480

Such interests may involve risks in connection with such third-party involvement, including the possibility that a third-party may be in a position to take (or block) action in a manner contrary to the Company's objectives or may have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on such interest. Acquisitions made with third parties in joint ventures or other entities also may involve carried interests and/or other fees payable to such third party partners or co-venturers. There can be no assurance that desirable minority shareholder rights will be available or that such rights will provide sufficient protection of the Company's interests. 6.1.9 Certain of the Company's businesses may require additional capital Certain of the Company's businesses, especially those in development phases, may require additional financing to satisfy their working capital requirements. The amount of the additional financing needed will depend upon the maturity and objectives of the particular business. The Company may seek to raise any required capital from different sources, and subsidiaries in foreign countries may raise capital locally. The availability of capital is generally a function of capital market conditions that are beyond the control of the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to predict accurately the future capital requirements necessary for success or that additional funds will be available from any source as needed. An inability to timely raise capital may materially and adversely affect the Company and/or its business. 6.1.10 KUE's subsidiaries operate in regulated industries; failure to comply with governmental regulation and licensing requirements could have a material adverse effect on operations The pre-K-12 education business is highly regulated and is often subsidized with government funding or reimbursement programs. In addition, KUE and its subsidiaries may require the consent or approval of applicable regulatory authorities in order to acquire or operate particular businesses, including in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has limited or no experience with the regulatory framework. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or failure or inability to obtain applicable approvals, could have a material adverse effect on the operations of KUE and/or its subsidiaries. For example, KLC's centers and school programs are subject to numerous state and local regulations and licensing requirements. KLC has policies and procedures in place to assist in complying with such regulations and requirements. Although these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, government agencies generally review, among other things, the fitness and adequacy of buildings and equipment, the ratio of staff personnel to enrolled children, staff training, record keeping, children's dietary program, the daily curriculum, and compliance with health and safety standards and transportation safety. In most jurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of the centers and licenses must be renewed periodically. Most jurisdictions establish requirements for background checks or other clearance procedures for new employees of child care centers and school programs. Repeated failures y any ot KLC's centers to comply with applicable regulations may result in sanctions against that cente r program and other centers or programs in the same jurisdiction, including probation or, in more seriou cases, suspension or revocation of a center's or program's license to operate. In addition, this type of action could attract negative publicity extending beyond that jurisdiction. • licensing authority may determine that a particular center or program is in violation of applicabl egulations and may take action against that center or program and possibly other centers or programs i the same jurisdiction. For more information, see "The Operating Company (KLC OpCo) - Licensing and Government Regulation." 6.1.11 Future legislation or new regulations may place additional burdens on the Company and have a material adverse effect on operations Additional, different and/or more stringent regulations and licensing requirements may become applicable in the future due to changes in laws and regulations, judicial or administrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations, changes in the Company's business strategy or for other reasons. State authorities 48 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024481

routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing requirements and may implement changes that significantly increase operating costs. For example, a change in the required ratio of child center staff personnel to enrolled children in a certain jurisdiction could increase KLC center or program staff operating expenses in that jurisdiction and therefore have a material adverse effect on KLC's operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to (i) obtain all required regulatory approvals that it does not yet have or that it may require in the future; (il) obtain any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals; or (ill) maintain required regulatory approvals. Delay in obtaining or failure to obtain and maintain in full force and effect any regulatory approvals, or amendments thereto, or delay or failure to satisfy any regulatory conditions or other applicable requirements, could prevent operation of the facility or sales to third parties, or could result in additional costs to the Company. 6.1.12 Conflicts of interest may arise with the Principals and their affiliates The Principals will agree (on behalf of themselves and their affiliates) that KUE will be their exclusive vehicle for equity investment opportunities in and acquisitions of for-profit companies engaged primarily in the business of pre-k through 12th grade education of children (other than companies in which the Principals or their affiliates directly or indirectly owns fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting stock (or similar voting interests) as of the date of the first closing of the offering, which are LeapFrog Enterprises, Inc. and Nobel Learning Communities, Inc.). The Principals will not acquire or make an equity investment in such companies unless such acquisition or investment opportunity has been first presented to the Independent Committee and subsequently declined by the Independent Committee or initially pursued but later abandoned by KUE. See "The Structure of KUE and the General Partner - Investment in Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures." In addition, existing companies in which KULG and/or its principals are investors along with other unrelated investors may invest in or acquire companies involved in areas relating to education. Following the consummation of the offering, the Principals will control the General Partner other than with respect to certain actions requiring Investor approval as further described in "The Structure of KUE and the General Partner." Conflicts could emerge between the Principals and the Company in the future, including conflicts due to the other business segments in which the Principals may have interests, separate from the Company. In addition, affiliates of the Principals will have certain financial interests in KUE and certain of its subsidiaries as described in "Related Party Transactions" following the consummation of the offering independent of their ownership of the Units, which may present conflicts of interest. Certain other potential conflicts of interest include: • Other activities of management - the Principals and other senior management personnel of the Company are subject to a variety of prior and continuing obligations unrelated to the Company Accordingly, conflicts may arise in the allocation of management time and resources. Lack of separate counsel for Investors - no separate counsel has been engaged by the Company to act on behalf of Investors in the Company. For a description of existing arrangements between the Company and its affiliates, see "Related Party Transactions." For a description of certain restrictions on one of the Principals and the Company, see "The Company may not engage in certain businesses" below. By acquiring an interest in the Company, each Investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the existence of any such actual or potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence of any such conflict of interest. 49 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024482

6.1.13 The Company may not engage in certain businesses On February 24, 1998, without admitting or denying liability, Michael R. Milken consented to the entry of a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Michael R. Milken et al., which judgment was entered on February 26, 1998 restraining and enjoining Michael Milken from associating with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, investment company or municipal securities dealer, and from violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). On March 11, 1991, in the action entitled in the Matter of Michael R. Milken, the SEC instituted a proceeding pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and ordered that Michael Milken be barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment advisor, investment company or municipal securities dealer. On April 24, 1990, concurrently with a plea agreement covering criminal violations of federal securities laws, Michael Milken also consented, without admitting or denying liability, to the entry of a final judgment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated, et al., restraining and enjoining Michael Milken from engaging in transactions, acts, practices and courses of business which constitute or would constitute violations of, or which aid and abet or would aid and abet violations of, Sections 7(c), 7(f), 9(a)(2), 10(b), 13(d), 14(e), 15(c)(3) and 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, and Regulations T and X and Rules 10b-5, 10b-6, 13d-1, 13d-2, 14e-3, 15c3-1, 17a-3 and 17a-4 promulgated thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. The Company cannot be in the business of or associated with a broker, dealer, investment company, investment advisor, or municipal securities dealer (collectively, "prohibited businesses"). As a result, the Company cannot pursue any acquisitions or investments that may have the effect of the Company being in any prohibited business. This could adversely affect the Company's ability to make and/or hold 6.1.14 Litigation and adverse publicity concerning alleged incidents at KLC or other child care centers could hurt KLC's reputation KLC is subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and litigation involving allegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Any such allegations, claims or lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's financial position, operating results or cash flows. Personal trust and parent referrals play a key role in the child care business. KLC believes its success is directly related to its reputation and favorable brand identity. KLC is periodically subject to claims and litigation alleging negligence, inadequate supervision and other grounds for liability arising from injuries or other harm to children. In addition, claimants may seek damages from KLC for child abuse, sexual abuse or other criminal acts arising out of alleged incidents at KLC's centers. There are lengthy statute of limitations periods applicable to child abuse and personal injury claims. Such claims may typically be rought until a number of years after a claimant reaches the age ot majority. Any adverse publicit oncerning such incidents at one of KLC's child care centers, or child care centers generally, could greatl damage KLC's reputation and could have an adverse effect on occupancy levels at KLC's centers. 6.1.15 KLC's insurance policies may be inadequate to cover claims, and KLC may be unable to maintain existing coverage in the future at reasonable prices Some operators of child care centers have experienced difficulty obtaining general liability insurance or other liability insurance that covers child abuse KLC maintains insurance policies to protect against relevant liability exposures in amounts KLC considers to be appropriate. In addition, KLC's owned centers are covered by blanket insurance policies, including property insurance. Although KLC has not historically had to pay any claims exceeding its coverage, claims in excess of, or not included within, its coverage may be asserted. To the extent that any claims are not covered by insurance, KLC will be forced to cover the associated costs itself, which will reduce the amount of cash KLC has available for other business purposes. 50 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024483

Insurance premiums have increased significantly in the past and may increase in the future because of market conditions in the insurance business generally, conditions in the child care industry more particularly or KLC's situation specifically. KLC cannot be certain of the cost or coverage it will obtain with replacements of existing policies, which will depend on the factors described above. 6.1.16 Factors beyond the Company's control, such as economic conditions, may adversely affect the demand for child care services Demand for child care services is subject to fluctuations in general economic conditions, and the Company's revenues depend, in part, on the number of working mothers and workino single parents who require child care services. Recessionary pressure on the economy, and a consequent reduction in the general labor force, may adversely impact the Company because out-of-work parents tend to stop using In addition, certain demographic trends which are favorable to the Company's business, including the increasing percentage of mothers in the workforce and the growth in population of children of the age needing child care, as well as trends in the preference of working parents and employers for center based child care, may not continue. Other factors beyond the Company's control could adversely affect demand, such as terrorism, natural disasters and epidemics. Children attending KLC's facilities are generally enrolled on a weekly basis. Accordingly, any change in economic conditions or other external factors affecting demand will impact us more quickly than businesses with longer contractual periods. 6.1.17 A loss or reduction of government funding for child care assistance programs or food reimbursement programs could adversely affect KLC Federal and state child care assistance programs accounted for approximately 20% of KLC's revenues during the one year period ended December 31, 2005. These funds are primarily from the Child Care and Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, which are designed to assist low-income families with child care expenses and are administered through various state agencies. Although additional funding for child care may be available for low income families as part of welfare reform and the reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, KLC may not benefit from any such additional funding. KLC is eligible to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, or CACFP, which provides reimbursement for meals and snacks that meet certain USDA approved nutritional guidelines. Centers can qualify to participate in the CACFP by meeting one of two tests: 25% or more of the enrolled students receive child care assistance funding or 25% or more of the center's customers have household incomes that are at or below state specified income levels. Reimbursement is calculated based on the percentage of the center's customers that fall into a "free" or "reduced" income category established by the state. Federal or state child care assistance programs may not continue to be funded at current levels, could have a material adverse effect on KLC's business. Adverse changes to the national or local economies may result in an increase in the number of families eligible for child care assistance. In order to compensate for such increases, state or local governments have in the past, and may in the future, increased parent co-payments required under such programs or change the eligibility requirements to reduce the number of families eligible to participate in such programs. An increase in the required parent co-payments may discourage parents from sending their children to KLC's centers. An increase in required parent co-payments also increases KLO's exposure to the risk of non-payment by these parents. In addition, states which reduce funding for child care may be unable to qualify to receive funds under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Such states may utilize funds under the 51 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024484

Child Care and Development Block Grant to provide child care assistance to needy families in lieu of TANF funds, thereby reducing the amount of funds available to other families, including families that utilize KLC's child care centers. 6.1.18 A termination or reduction of tax credits for child care could have a material adverse effect on KLC's business <LC may enjoy heightened demand for its services because of tax incentives for child care programs Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to herein as the "Code" provides a federal income tax credit ranging from 20% to 35% of specified child care expenses with maximum eligible expenses of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children. The fees paid to KLC by eligible taxpayers for child care services qualify for these tax credits, subject to the limitations of Section 21 of the Code. However, these tax incentives are subject to change. Code Section 45F provides incentives to employers to offset costs related to employer provided child care facilities. Costs related to (a) acquiring or constructing property used as a qualified child care center, (b) operating an existing child care center, or (c) contracting with an independent child care operator to care for the children of the taxpayer's employees will qualify for the credit. The credit amount is 25% of the qualified costs. An additional credit of 10% of qualified expenses for child care resource and referral services has also been enacted. The maximum credit available for any taxpayer is $150,000 per tax year. Many states offer tax credits in addition to the federal credits discussed above. Credit programs vary by state and may apply to both the individual taxpayer and the employer. A termination or reduction of such tax credits could have a material adverse effect on KLC's business. 6.1.19 Material weaknesses in KLC's internal controls were discovered during KLC's 2005 audit For a discussion of certain material weaknesses in KLC's internal controls discovered in KLC's 2005 audit, see "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003" in Appendix B. To address these issues, and as part of the Company's growth plan, KLC is increasing expenditures on IT systems and accounting and IT personnel. 6.1.20 If KLC is unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees, if minimum wage rates increase or if KLC's employees unionize, KLC's results of operations may be adversely affected KLC believes that its success is largely dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of KLC's child care center staff are entry level wage earning employees, and turnover in this industry has traditionally been significant. If KLC is unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified operations may be adversely affected. Since early 1998, union organization efforts in the child care industry have received considerable publicity. While union officials associated with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Service Employees International have repeatedly announced their intention to engage in a nation-wide effort to organize child care workers, organization efforts have been focused on government-funded providers. To date, efforts to organize employees of for-profit providers have been minimal. However, organizational efforts may occur and, if successful, could have an adverse effect on KLC's relationships with employees and KLC's labor costs. In addition, the general publicity surrounding such efforts, even if not focused on KLC's centers, could result in increased wages for child care workers and, as a result, increase KLC's labor costs. 52 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024485

6.1.21 Because KLC (through KLC PropCo) owns or leases a substantial number of real properties, and expects to invest in additional properties, results of operations could be adversely affected if environmental contamination is discovered on any of the properties KLC is subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that may impose liability for damages from past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances as well as clean up costs. In particular, under applicable environmental laws, KLC may be responsible for investigating and remediating environmental conditions and may be subject to associated liability, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, relating to KLC's properties. These obligations could arise whether KLC owns or leases the property at issue and regardless of whether the environmental conditions were created by KLC or by a prior owner or tenant. Environmental conditions unknown to KLC at this time relating to prior, existing or future properties may be discovered and may have a material adverse effect on KLC's results of operations. 6.1.22 KUE has a limited history While certain subsidiaries of KUE have a financial and an operating history, KUE has only recently been organized and has relatively little financial or operating history upon which prospective investors may evaluate its performance, and has not prepared separate or consolidated financial statements. The prior performance of the subsidiaries of KUE described herein may not be indicative of the future results of the 6.2. Tax Risks 6.21 Certain tax considerations generally applicable to Investors subject to U.S. tax liability KUE is expected to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each Investor that is subject to U.S. federal income tax liability will take into account its allocable share of items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit of KUE (as determined under the Limited Partnership Agreement), without regard to whether it has received distributions from KUE. As a result, the tax liability to an Investor resulting from such allocation may exceed the cash distributions made by KUE to the Investor Further, upon the sale of its Common LP Units, an Investor may, depending on the amount of Compan debt, if any, and the Investor's adjusted tax basis, incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), or other taxing authority may challenge the manner in which income, gains, losses and deductions are allocated to holders of Common LP Units, the General Partner and holders of the Profits Participation LP Units under the Limited Partnership Agreement. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, allocation of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction to a partner in a partnershio will be aiven effect so long as the allocation has "substantial economic effect" or is otherwise in accordance with the partner's interest in the partnership. If an allocation of an item pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement does not satisfy this standard or is deemed not to satisfy this standard by the IRS, it will be reallocated by the IRS among the Partners on the basis of their respective interests in KUE (as determined by the IRS), taking into account all facts and circumstances. In such a case, Investors could have additional tax liabilities or suffer adverse tax consequences. An investment in KUE will give rise to a variety of complex U.S. federal income tax and other tax issues for Investors. Certain of those issues may relate to special rules applicable to certain types of Investors subject to U.S. tax, such as tax-exempt entities, foundations, life insurance companies, banks, dealers, in securities, U.S. persons who own 10% or more of KUE and non-U.S. persons and entities. Prospective Investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with specific reference to their situations concerning an investment in KUE. 53 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024486

6.2.2 Tax-Exempt and Non-U.S. Investors may become subject to U.S. Tax KUE business activities could generate income that will be taxable to certain otherwise tax-exempt Investors as "unrelated business taxable income." Although, under the Limited Partnership Agreement, the General Partner is required to use its reasonable best efforts not to engage in, or invest in (other than through an entity that is not a pass-through entity) a pass-through entity that engages in, any activity which constitutes the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and generates income which constitutes "effectively connected income" in the hands of the non-U.S. Investors that own Common LP Units, it is possible that some of KUE's business activities and acquisitions could generate income that is "effectively connected" with a U.S. trade or business which could create U.S. federal income tax reporting, tax liability, and tax withholding for non-U.S. Investors. Additionally, KUE believes that neither KUE nor its subsidiaries is currently a U.S. Real Property Holding Corporation ("USRPH") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, no assurances can be given in this regard. Furthermore, it is possible that in the future KUE and/or its subsidiaries may become a USRPHC if, for example, the value of the U.S. real estate holdings of KUE or such subsidiary increases sufficiently. A disposition of an interest in a USRPHC could create gain for non-U.S. Investors which would be treated as if the non-U.S. Investor were engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. and as if such gain were effectively connected with such trade or business. This would create U.S. federal income tax reporting, tax liability and withholding for non-U.S. Investors. Investors that are non-U.S. persons are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the USRPHC rules to their investment in KUE. 6.2.3 Investors may become subject to taxation in non-U.S. jurisdictions KUE expects to make investments in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and KUE, its subsidiaries and/or the Investors may be subject to income or other tax in those jurisdictions. in addition, local tax incurred in non-U.S. jurisdictions by KUE or subsidiaries through which it invests may not entitle Investors to either (i) a credit against tax that may be owed in the U.S. or their respective local tax jurisdictions, or (i) a deduction against income taxable in the U.S. or such local jurisdictions by the Investors. 6.2.4 Controlled Foreign Corporations KUE anticipates that it and/or its subsidiaries will invest in non-U.S. operations. Depending upon the percentage of ownership of such operations by KUE and its subsidiaries and the type of legal entity chosen for such operations, these non-U.S. operations could be classified as a Controlled Foreign Corporation ("CFC") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an entity is classified as a CFC, certain types of income could be taxable to U.S. persons owning 10% or more of KUE for U.S. income tax purposes, even if no distributions of cash are made from such entity, and gain from the disposition of such entity would be taxed as if it were a dividend to the extent of such entity's earnings and profits, rather than as a capital gain, for U.S. income tax purposes. 6.2.5 Treatment of KUE as a U.S. Entity Under the Code, certain non-U.S corporations may be treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, thereby subjecting such non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax on their Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation includes one such provision. Under this legislation, referred to as the anti-inversion legislation, non-U.S. corporations that acquire interests in a U.S. corporation or partnership and meet certain ownership, operational and other tests may be treated as U.S. corporations for federal income tax purposes. The legislation grants broad regulatory authority to the U.S Secretary of Treasury to provide such regulations as may be appropriate to determine whether a non-U.S. corporation is treated as a U.S. corporation or as are necessary to carry out the intent of the provision, including adjusting its application as necessary to prevent the avoidance of its purpose. Recently issued Treasury regulations provide that the anti-inversion legislation is applicable to a foreign partnership that is or becomes a "publicly traded partnership" within two years of the acquisition by it of a U.S. corporation. A "publicly traded partnership" is any partnership (i) interests in which are traded on an established securities market, or (ii) interests in which are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). KUE believes that it is not currently a publicly traded partnership and does not intend 54 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024487

to become a publicly traded partnership within two years of this offering or the acquisition of KLC and k12. As a result, KUE does not believe the anti-inversion legislation or any regulations promulgated within the scope of the legislation's regulatory authority should apply to KUE although no assurance can be given in this regard or with respect to any new acquisitions of or investments in U.S. corporations. In addition, KUE does not believe that any other Code provision subjecting non-U.S. corporations to U.S. federal income tax should apply to KUE or its subsidiaries, although no assurance can be in this regards. The promulgation of contrary regulations or a successful challenge of either of these positions by the Internal Revenue Service could materially reduce a holder's after-tax return and, thus, could result in a substantial reduction of the value of the Units. 6.2.6 Currency Fluctuations An investment in KUE is a U.S. dollar denominated investment. Contributions to and distributions from KUE will be made in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in value between the U.S. dollar and the Investor's functional currency (if other than the U.S. dollar) may result in taxable income to the Investor. 6.2.7 Reporting Requirements Investors who are U.S. Persons will be required to file an IRS Form 8865 with the Investor's U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the Investor purchases the Common LP Units. Investors who are U.S. Persons may, depending upon the size of their investment in the General Partner, be required to file an IRS Form 5471 with the Investor's U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the Investor purchases Class A ordinary shares in the General Partner. Additionally, depending on the type of non-U.S. investments KUE makes, Investors who are U.S. Persons may be required to file additional IRS Forms such as a Form 5471 in subsequent years. 6.3. Risks Related to Projections 6.3.1 The projections included in this Memorandum and otherwise provided to potential Investors are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties; potential Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such projections The projections included in this Memorandum and other models and forecasts that may be presented to or discussed with Investors represent management's best estimates as of the date of this Memorandum of KLC's, KLC OpCo's and KLC PropCo's projected results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 to 2011 (the "Projections"). The Projections were not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or any regulatory or professional agency or body or generally accepted accounting principles of the U.S. or any other country. In addition, neither the Agents, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent auditors, nor any other independent expert, accountant or counsel has examined, reviewed or compiled the Projections and, consequently, assume no responsibility for them. The Projections should be read together with, and are qualified in their entirety by, the information contained in the rest of this "Risk Factors" section, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of Operations," "Business" and the financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this Memorandum. The Projections do not include any expenses of any entity within the Company above the KLC level, including KUE expenses ($17.5 million of the $20.0 million payable pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement) that will be payable by KUE for administrative and other services. See "Related Party Transactions." The Projections also do not include any projected expenses relating to grants of Profits Participation Units or other equity-related grants, including for the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan at Knowledge Schools, Inc. ("KSI"), pursuant to which payments may be made based on different valuations of KSI stock and are based on the same multiples of Adjusted EBITDA used in 2005; actual valuations are conducted annually and may be higher or lower. Finally, the Projections do not reflect projected interest expenses on KUE debt. 55 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024488

The Projections do not assume that the Company will make any future material acquisitions, even though the Company expects to use the proceeds of the sale of the Units, among other purposes, for acquisitions, which will likely affect actual performance and cause it to differ from the Projections. The Projections assume the success of the Company's operating strategy, although no assurance can be given that the Company's strategy will be effective or that the anticipated benefits from the strategy will be realized in the periods for which the Projections have been prepared. The assumptions described herein are those that the Company believes are most significant to the Projections; however, not all assumptions used in preparing the Projections have been set forth herein. The Projections, in general, assume that: (i) the Company will not be negatively or positively impacted by any material legal proceedings; (ii) there will be no material change in any of the Company's existing contracts or leases; (iii) there will be no change in generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. that will have a material effect on the financial results of the Company; (iv) there will be no labor disputes, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics (such as avian flu) or other disturbances that would materially affect the operations or revenues ofthe Company; and (V) that worldwide economic conditions and economic conditions in the U.S. remain generally favorable and consistent with those prevailing on the date of this Memorandum. The Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks, uncertainties and contingencies which are beyond the control of KLC, and upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions which are subject to change. Accordingly, the Projections are only an estimate, and actual results will vary from the Projections, and these variations may be material. Consequently, the inclusion of the Projections herein should not be regarded as a representation of the Company, its advisors, the Agents, or any other person of results that will actually be achieved. Projections are necessarily speculative in nature, and it is usually the case that one or more of the assumptions in projections do not materialize. Prospective purchasers of the Units are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Projections. The limited k12 projections contained in this Memorandum were received from k12 management and were not prepared by the Company or its management. The Company does not intend to update or otherwise revise the Projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions do not come to fruition. Furthermore, the Company does not intend to update or revise the Projections to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. 6.4. Risks Related to Investing in the Units 6.4.1 There will be significant unallocated net proceeds from the offering If there are additional closings after the initial closing of the offering, after repayment of KUE's debt, a significant amount of the anticipated net proceeds from the offering of the Units may not have been designated for specific uses. Therefore, the Company's management will have broad discretion within the business scope of the Company with respect to the use of the net proceeds of the offering. There can be no assurance that the uses of proceeds will benefit the Company or Investors. 6.4.2 Investors will only have limited rights to receive ongoing information about the Company Other than as expressly provided in the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE (the "Limited Partnership Agreement, the Company does not expect to provide ongoing detailed information regarding its business, financial condition or results of operations to Investors. The Limited Partnership Agreement provides that Investors shall receive yearly audited financial statements of the Company, as well as semi- 56 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024489

annual reports on the Company's operations. In addition, Investors have the right to access certain other information regarding the Company as provided for in the Limited Partnership Agreement. As long as the Units are not registered under the Exchange Act, the Company will not be subject to the reporting thereunder. KLC's 2005 audit was not completed until May 2006 due to systems conversion issues. 6.4.3 Investors may never receive cash distributions on their investment; there is no assurance of investment return There is no assurance that KUE will be able to generate returns for the Investors or that returns will be commensurate with the risks of investing in KUE. There may be limited or no cash flow available to KUE from its subsidiaries or to the Investors from KUE and there can be no assurance that KUE will make any distributions to Investors. KUE is not obligated to declare cash distributions with respect to the Units other than certain distributions to meet tax obligations of the Investors. Public offerings, sales or other dispositions which may result in a return of capital or the realization of gains, if any, are not expected to occur for a number of years. An investment in KUE should only be considered by persons who can reasonably afford a loss of their entire investment. 6.4.4 KUE's ability to make distributions is limited by its subsidiaries' existing and future indebtedness KUE will not have any material assets other than its ownership of various subsidiaries (including KLC) and investments in other companies, and will not have any material operations or revenues other than income derived from KUE's interest in its subsidiaries and any proceeds arising from its investments in other companies. Therefore, KUE's ability to make any distributions to Investors will be completely dependent on the operations and business results of its subsidiaries and its investment holdings. KLC's ability to make distributions or payments to KUE is restricted by the provisions of its various debt agreements, including without limitation, the Indenture, dated as of February 2, 2005, by and between KLC, the Guarantors, as defined therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Therefore, KLC may be prevented from making distributions or payments to KUE as and when needed by KUE. Such restrictions may adversely affect the business and operations of KUE as a whole and the value of any investment in KUE. Similar restrictions may apply to future indebtedness incurred by KLC and other subsidiaries of KUE. 6.4.5 There is no public market for, and Investors may be unable to sell, the Units There is no public trading market for the Units and one is not expected to develop. The economic risks of this investment must be borne for an indefinite period of time. Neither the Units nor the underlying Common LP Units or Class A Shares will be registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws (or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction). Each Investor will be required to represent that it is purchasing the Units for its own account for investment purposes and not with a view to resale or distribution. Although the General Partner intends to approve permitted transfers specified in the LPA, and not to unreasonably withhold consent to transfers, all transfers require the prior approval of the General Partner under Caymans Law, and no transfer of the Units may be made unless the transfer complies with the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement. Although the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE and the organizational documents of the General Partner permit the foregoing transfers and the General Partner has agreed with certain Investors to approve such transfers, applicable Cayman Islands law gives the General Partner full discretion to approve or disapprove transfers. Each transfer must be registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption must be available. These restrictions will be noted on a legend placed on each certificate, if any, representing the Units. As a precondition to the effectiveness of any transfer, the Company may require the transferor to provide an opinion of legal counsel stating that the transfer is in accordance with the Securities Act and to pay any costs the Company incurs in connection with the transfer. It is not currently contemplated that the Units will be registered under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or 57 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024490

other securities laws. In addition, certain provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which permit the resale, subject to various terms and conditions, of restricted securities after they have been held for one year, do not apply to the Units because the Company is not required to file and does not file, current reports under the Exchange Act and does not, and does not intend to, make comparable information publicly available. 6.4.6 Purchasers of the Units are subject to Dilution Although we have not prepared a consolidated balance sheet for KUE, prior to this offering and the conversion of $180 million of KUE's preferred limited partner units currently held by the Principals and their affiliates into Common LP Units at the per Common LP Unit issuance price, we expect that KUE would have negative or nominally positive common equity book value due to its historical capital structure, including its level of indebtedness. As a result, the book value per Unit acquired in this offering will be substantially less after this offering than the purchase price paid by the Investors. The Investors' interests are also subject to future dilution if and to the extent the Company grants options, profits interest units or similar rights to officers, directors or employees of the Company, and will also be affected by any awards by the Company under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan described under "Management Incentive Plans and Employment Agreements." Investors will have a Co-invest Right to purchase a pro-rata portion of certain issuances of Units by the Company for cash; however, such right is subject to customary exceptions. See "The Structure of KUE and the General Partner." 6.4.7 KUE and the General Partner are not U.S. entities; disputes must be resolved by binding arbitration in the United Kingdom KUE will be a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The General Partner is a Cayman Islands exempted company- The internal governance of KUE will be pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement in compliance with applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. The internal governance of the General Partner will be pursuant to the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the agreement among members in compliance with applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. All disputes under the applicable agreements or related to this offering must be resolved through binding arbitration conducted in the United Kingdom under the London Court of International Arbitration Rules. Such laws and Rules may offer less or different protections to Investors than laws applicable to comparable U.S. entities or laws of the Investors' home countries. 6.4.8 The Company will not be operated to optimize the investment, tax or other objectives of any individual Investor The Investors may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to their investments in the Company. The conflicting interests of individual Investors may relate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of investments made by the Company and the structuring or the acquisition of nvestments. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by th general Partner, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments, that may be mor beneficial for one Investor than for another Investor, especially with respect to Investors' individual tax situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Company, the General Partner will concerning an investment in the Units. 6.4.9 The Investors may not separately transfer the constituent securities underlying the Units The Investors may not separately transfer Common LP Units or Class A Shares (unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors of the General Partner and the Independent Committee), and there may be less Investor interest in a security such as the Units than there would be in more traditional 58 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024491

corporate or partnership investments. This restriction may adversely affect an Investors' ability to transfer the Units in the future. 6.4.10 Under certain circumstances, the General Partner may cause an Investor's interest in KUE to be redeemed or transferred Under circumstances where the continuing participation in KUE by an Investor would have a material adverse effect on the Company, the General Partner may cause an Investor's interest in KUE to be redeemed or transferred. See "Limitation of a Limited Partner's Participation" in Section 4.11 of the Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE. 59 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024492

7. DISTRIBUTION POLICY We intend to retain any future earnings to fund working capital, debt service, acquisitions and growth and in the credit facility and indenture of KLC restrict distributions by KLC that could, in turn, be made available for future distributions by KUE to its partners. 60 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024493

8. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 8.1. Human Capital Historically, the world economy has been viewed as being driven by an asset base of natural resources. This has shifted to an economy driven by industrial and financial resources. This perception is reinforced through the statistics and measurements used by governments, as seen in the Federal Reserve's representation of the U.S. balance sheet. However, it is KUE's view that the real assets of a city, state, region or country are its people (human capital) and their productive capacity. KUE believes that national economies that fail to embrace this concept will be left behind. Nobel Prize winning economist Gary Becker estimates that in today's service based economy, human capital accounts for 76% of the assets in 2005 Human Capital - $238 Trillion Market 2005 U.S. Balance Sheet - $62 Trillion Market Human and Social Capital 74% US Financial Assets 26% Bonds Other Financial 4% Other Tangible Deposits Estate 32% 10 Corp. Pension Equitios 16% Reserves Source: Gary Becker Source: U.S. Federal Reserve Importantly in today's economy, the value of a company is increasingly driven by creativity, innovation and education. Companies are recognizing that human capital is their defining asset. With the value of education becoming apparent to government and businesses alike, the Principals believe that a significant opportunity exists to create an education company that will promote and cultivate human capital. Today, not a single education company ranks in the top 100 worldwide as measured by market capitalization. Within 20 years, KUE believes that the education space will contain some of the largest 8.1.1 Enhancing Human Capital through Education Education is a primary factor in improving an individual's life-long productivity. Studies have shown that a higher level of education leads to increased lifetime earnings, and that this is increasingly true in the new, knowledge economy. 61 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024494

As shown below, an individual with a professional degree earns approximately 100% more than a college graduate and an individual with a bachelor's degree earns approximately 70% more than a high school graduate in their lifetime. Education and Wage Disparity: Lifetime Earnings (Ages 18-64) $6.0 - • $5.3 $5.0 $4.2- $4.0 $3.0 $2.7 $2.3 $2.0 - $1.4- $1.6 $1.0 - $0.0 + 1991 —— Professional Degree — 1995 - Bachelor's Degree 1999 2003 - High School Diploma Source: U.S. Census Bureau. Despite the results of the study shown above, 35% of Americans over the age of 18 have not graduated high school. Only one-third of the 25% of Americans who have received a bachelor's degree, or 8%, have received a graduate degree. Studies by Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman suggest that the highest rate of return within education is generated through an investment in early childhood programs. Heckman's study asserts, "The rate of return to a dollar investment made while a person is young is higher than the rate of return to the same dollar made at a later age," as illustrated below: Preschool Programs Return School Opportunity Cost of Funds Job Training Preschool School Post School Age Source: August 2002 study, James Heckman, University of Chicago. Due to the high rate of return of investments in ECE and the principles underlying the theory of human capital, KUE has made its largest initial investment in KLC, the largest company serving the ECE market in the world 18 Source: U.S. Census Bureau. 62 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024495

8.2. The Education Market Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross national income of $48 trillion. In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1.0 trillion market with for- profit education accounting for $81 billion or 7.8% of this amount. The for-profit component of this industry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate training) is projected to grow faster than the overall historical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit operations in the sector, to reach a market size of $116 billion by 2010.19 Education is still predominantly provided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE believes that the industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the evolution observed in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and telecommunications.

The U.S. Early Childcare or "pre-K" Market The highly fragmented early childcare or "pre-K" market includes care based in homes and housed by community organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, YMCAs) and center based facilities. Center- based childcare includes preschools (nurseries), workplace centers (located on-site at the company), lease-model centers (located in a real estate developer's office building), back-up centers (a variety of on- site and off-site back-up care programs) and family day-care facilities (located in someone's home or center). Although childcare may evoke thoughts of a babysitting service, education has become an increasingly important element in services to pre-K children. However, the education-focused portion of the childcare market remains relatively small. Since the early 1980s, center-based ECE has become the care provider of choice for families. The U.S. ECE unit generated an estimated $54 billion in total spending in 2005, representing a 10% compound annual growth rate since 1982.19 Approximately five million or 60% of 3 to 5-year-olds with working mothers are enrolled in ECE centers. The following growth drivers are expected to continue to fuel growth in the early childcare market: growing importance of ECE, demographics (e.g., more children aged five and younger), increase in families with two working parents, more educated parents, corporations recognizing the benefits of childcare services and tax incentives and other positive legislation. The perception of ECE as a fundamental component of child development has contributed to average annual fee increases of roughly 7% amongst center-based facilities, reflecting the stable, relatively inelastic nature of the demand for higher quality care.? The number of children receiving childcare 17 Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics Database. 18 Source: US Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics and Training Magazine and Harris Nesbitt research. 10 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. 2° Source: "Early Care and Education: Work Support for Families and Developmental Opportunity for Young Children," Urban Institute, September 22 Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector, 2002. 63 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024496

outside the home grew from 10.6 million in 1999 to an estimated 12 million in 2003, an increase of 3.1% annually. 8.3.1 Early Childhood Education's Role in the Economy ECE enables people to pursue income-generating activities by allowing parents to participate in the workforce and contribute to the economy. A recent study found that every dollar spent on the foremote sector generates approximately 15 dollars worth of additional earnings by parents. evidence suggests that regardless of family income, children who have participated in ECE programs do better in school than their peers who did not. ECE also reduces social and economic costs by lowering school dropout rates, and leads to decreased levels of criminal activity. These social and demographic forces have established ECE as a fundamental component of today's economic 'infrastructure' and a source of economic growth. Given these and other supporting facts, education is an industry that is of growing importance to the economy. This growth is driven by the following factors: • Growing public awareness of the importance of early childhood education. ECE has received government attention as scientific research highlights the importance of education during a child's early developmental years. Children who attend high quality ECE centers demonstrate greater mathematical ability, thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems throughout their educational lives, when compared with children receiving no or lower quality care. These differences hold true for children from a range of family backarounds. • Favorable demographic trends. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the annual number of live births in the U.S. was approximately 4.1 million in 2003, compared to approximately 3.6 million in 1980, and the U.S. Census Bureau projects the annual number of live births to increase to approximately 4.5 million in 2015.25 The number of children aged five years or under grew from approximately 22.5 million in 1990 to approximately 23.4 million in 2002, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and is projected to reach 26.8 million in 2015.22 Number of Live Births in the U.S (in thousands) 4,500 - 4,250 - 4,000 - 3,750 - 3,500+ 1985 1987 1989 Source: U.S. Census Bureau. 1991 1993 1995 2005 2007E 2009E 2011E 2013E 2015E • Changing workforce composition. A rising percentage of women participate in the workforce due to an increasingly higher cost of living, a desire for financial independence and an elevated standard of living preference, which necessitates two full-time wage earners for most families. Of the nearly 65 million jobs created nationally between 1964 and 1997, 40 million were occupied by women. Today, more than 62% of mothers with children under the age of six work full-time compared to 19% in 1960. 22 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. 23 Source: The National Economic Impacts of the Child Care Sector, 2002. 24 Source: The Children of the Cost, Quality, and Outcomes Study Go To School, 1999. 25 Source: Population Projections Branch, U.S. Census Bureau, "U.S. Interim Projections by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin, " May 2004. 64 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024497

• Highly educated parents spend more on childcare. The increasing number of college graduates in the U.S. and abroad will support continued expenditures on ECE. In 2001, 70% of children with college- educated mothers attended childcare programs, while only 38% of children whose mothers had less than a high school degree attended childcare programs. A recent report by the U.S. Department of Commerce reveals that families with college degrees spent an average of $92.67 per week (per child) per week per chide whereas parents without a high school degree only spent an average of $59.70 # Increasing. demand for Employer-Sponsored Centers. With increased levels of employment, corporations are witnessing growing demand for ECE services. Companies benefit from offering childcare services to their employees as (i) it often reduces employee absenteeism; (ii) serves as a perquisite, which differentiates the employer's compensation package; and (ill) tends to lower turnover rates. ECE services contribute to a stable and consistent workforce. • Favorable tax incentives. Certain tax incentives are available to parents utilizing childcare programs. Specifically, Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a federal income tax credit (Child and Dependent Care Credit) ranging from 20% to 35% (increased in 2003) of certain childcare expenses for "qualifying individuals." The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 created a Federal Employer Tax Credit for certain childcare expenses beginning in 2002. Employers can receive a credit of 25% of their spending on the construction or rehabilitation of a child care facility or on contracts with a third party child care facility to provide child care services to employees. Corporations also benefit from tax incentives of up to $150,000 per year. 8.3.2 Industry Characteristics The ECE sector has a number of favorable operating characteristics. First, well-run school operators enjoy high returns on capital, predictable revenue streams and strong free cash flows, with students generally paying in advance of services delivered. Second, industry data shows that tuition rates have ncreased by approximately 7%, a rate which has exceeded inflation.' The current outlook suggests no change in this dynamic. Third, government regulation and licensing standards represent notable barriers to entry. Given that education is a universally accepted product, management believes that our business model is costs as economic and market conditions change. Often the demanding requirements for the selection of school directors and teachers can limit the pool of qualified employees for the industry. Low pay also tends to result in high turnover rates of approximately 50% annually within the industry. 8.3.3 Competitive Landscape: Early Childhood Education The ECE sector is highly fragmented with the top six providers representing approximately 5% of all Local nursery schools and ECE centers generally charge less for their services. Many religious-affiliated and other non-profit child care centers have no or lower rental costs than for-profit chains, may receive donations or other funding to cover operating expenses and may utilize volunteers for staffing. Consequently, tuition rates at these centers are commonly lower than the Company's rates. * Source: The is tomal Cooil impacts or the rid Care Sector, 202005. 65 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024498

There are also several national chains, such as Bright Horizons Family Solutions, La Petite Academy, Learning Care Group (ABC Learning) and Nobel Learning Communities, or regional for-profit companies with sizeable numbers of centers and similar economies of scale in curriculum development, marketing and site development.

KLC OpCo successfully competes against these companies, with the following differentiating factors: (i) strong brand equity; (i) a strong management team; (iii) grass roots level marketing; and (iv) a larger network of community centers. KLC also has a number of employer-sponsored centers that gives the Company greater breadth and depth. Finally, KLC is the only large competitor in the sector owned by an education company. Following is a brief description of each of several of the national competitors. • ABC Learning (Public, traded on the ASX) The Learning Care Group, ABC Learning's U.S. operating segment, has over 30,000 children enrolled (full and part-time) nationwide. Under the Childtime and Tutor Time segments, Learning Care operates child care centers and under the Franchise segment it licenses and provides developmental and administrative support to franchises operating under the Tutor Time brand. As of October 14, 2005, Childtime generated LTM sales of $220.7 million across 460 childcare centers in the U.S. (328 of which are company owned and 132 of which are franchised locations). On January 11, ABC announced it had successfully completed the acquisition of the Learning Care Group, Inc. for $159 million in cash. In addition to the 460 centers located in the U.S., ABC operates 707 centers in Australia and New Zealand. • Bright Horizons (Public) Founded in 1986, Bright Horizons Family Solutions is a leading provider of employer-sponsored child care services. Bright Horizons operates 616 childcare and early education centers for over 600 clients. The company serves more than 66,300 children in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Guam, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In September of 2005, the company acquired ChildrensFirst Inc. As of December 31, 2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $625 million and $75 million, respectively. • La Petite Academy (Private) La Petite is the third largest operator of for-profit pre-school centers in the U.S., currently serving more than 65,000 children in 649 centers located in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The company also 66 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024499

owns 68 (included in the 649 centers) Montessori schools which cater to K-12 students. LPA's residential Academies are typically located in residential, middle-income neighborhoods. As of February 28, 2006, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $411 million and $33 million, respectively. The company has been owned by JP Morgan Capital since 1998. • Nobel Learning Communities (Public) Nobel is a for-profit provider of private pay education and services for education entities for the preschool through 12th grade market. The company's programs are offered through a network of general education preschools, elementary and middle schools, programs for learning challenged students and special purpose high schools. Nobel operates 150 schools in 13 states across the U.S. As of December 31, 2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $166 million and $15 million, respectively. Affiliates of the Principals are currently significant shareholders of the company. 8.3.4 Government's Role in Early Childhood Education Approximately 83% of the estimated $54 billion spent on ECE is generated by private and independent non-profit services. The government provides the remaining 17% of services through Head Start and public schools. The government pays for public school and Head Start programs, but also subsidizes payments of low-income families to providers of their choice through the Child Care Development Block Grant and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which are blended with state dollars. About 25% of for-profit early childhood care revenue comes from these subsidy programs. The government is, at both the federal and state level, actively involved in expanding the availability of early childhood care services. Federal support is delivered at the state level through government- operated educational and financial assistance programs. Early childhood care services offered directly by states include training, licensing and regulation for early childhood care providers and resource and referral systems for parents seeking ECE. The increasing importance of education is further demonstrated by the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001," signed into law in January 2002. This Act is the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA, since ESEA was enacted in 1965. To support this commitment, President Bush requested a $54.4 billion budget for the Department of Education for fiscal 2007, a 28.9% increase from the 2001 budget of $42.2 billion. Certain tax incentives exist for early childhood care programs. Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code provides federal income tax credits ranging from 20% to 35% of certain early childhood care expenses for qualified individuals. 8.4. The U.S. K-12 Education Market A fundamental change has occurred in the K-12 sector in recent years, as the desire to improve school quality has overtaken demographics as a key growth driver. Companies providing supplemental educational services (e.g., KLC) and several school alternatives, such as charter and contract schools (e.g., k12), are expected to be instrumental in improving K-12 student performance. The K-12 education market in the U.S. is comprised of over 15,000 school districts including more than 90,000 K-12 public schools, approximately 3.5 million teachers, and about 54 million students according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Total K-12 expenditures, federal, state and local, are approximately $500 billion. Despite the growth in spending on public education over the last decade, student achievement has shown Proficient level. following factors will present significant market opportunities in the coming years for for-profit K-12 67 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024500

education providers. According to Harris Nesbitt Research, industry experts estimate that the $21.8 billion in revenues generated by for-profit education providers in 2004 will increase to over $29.7 billion in 2010, 5.3% annual growth. However, these estimates reflect only spending by institutions on educational material and do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational materials, which represented roughly an additional $20 billion in 2004.* For-Profit K-12 Education (2004 - 2010E $29.7 (in billions) $30 $25 - $20 $15 $10 $5 $O $21.8 $24.2 $26.8 $28.2 $25.5 $23.0 k12 } KLC 2004 2005 2006E 2007E 2008E 2009E 2010E • Professional Development • Print Publishing • Supplemental Services Technology Assessment • School Management Source: Harris Nesbitt estimates based on Eduventures' "The Education Industry: Learning Markets and Opportunities 2004" report (December 2004). Standards and Accountability. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of American students in grades K- 12, parents and lawmakers are demanding increased standards and accountability in schools. This demand has focused on establishing guidelines for every school and every subgroup of students and then holding the school (and its staff) accountable to students' performance relative to those standards. The Company expects continued focus on academic standards, assessments, and accountability in the near future. Despite this increased attention on standards and accountability, many parents continue to remain concerned with the overall effectiveness of the public school system and are increasingly relying on for-profit education providers. Charter Schools and Virtual Academies. There has also been a significant rise in the number of charter schools in the U.S. in the past decade. Since Minnesota first enacted legislation in 1991, 40 states and the District of Columbia have passed charter school legislation. Under the typical charter school statute, an identified entity, such as the state, a state university or local school district board of education, is authorized to grant a specified number of charters to community groups or non-profit entities to create a public charter school. A growing number of charter boards, in turn, contract with private sector organizations to manage the schools. In return for a large measure of autonomy from normal public school regulation, the charter school is accountable for student academic performance. Currently, the Company estimates that there were nearly 2,700 charter schools in operation nationwide, as of January 2003, with an estimated enrollment of over 685,000 students. Moreover, the federal No Child Left Behind Act ("NCLB") recognizes charter schools as a viable alternative for students who want to transfer from neighborhood schools that are failing. To capitalize upon the increasing number of parents who are willing to educate their children at home and still want to be part of the public system, there are a growing number of virtual schools, where much of the learning is home-based. Most current charter school legislation either explicitly authorizes virtual public schools or does not directly prohibit them. Because virtual schools usually offer a comprehensive curriculum, easy-to-use learning and performance evaluation technology assistance and instructional materials, the Company believes that a growing number of families will pursue virtual public schools as an attractive alternative to traditional schools and a more cost-effective, better organized approach to home schooling. The large and scalable platform that exists at k12 is designed to capitalize on this trend as the number of charter schools has grown on average nearly 13% annually, while charter school enrollment 28 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005. 68 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024501

has increased 20% annually, outpacing the less than 1% average K-12 enrollment growth over the same period. 29 K-12 Charter Schools and Enrollment (1995 to 2004) Charter Schools 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 • 1,000,000 0 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 • Schools - Students Note: Number of students in 1999-2000 school year was estimated. Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005 and Charter School Leadership Council and Center for Education Reform. Supplementary Education Market. For parents who continue to enroll their children in traditional public and private schools, there is a growing demand for supplemental education services. According to the U.S. Department of Education, 31% of elementary school children, or more than 10 million students nationwide, are enrolled in after-school programs. According to Eduventures, the U.S. supplementary education market was estimated to be approximately $8.1 billion in 2003. Additionally, under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, some children in poorly performing schools will be eligible for taxpayer- financed supplemental educational services. These supplemental educational services can be provided by state-approved non-profit or for-profit entities as well as private schools and public schools (including public charter schools). More parents want to spend educational time with their children, but lack access to high quality supplemental material that is effective and integrated into a comprehensive plan that is easy for a parent to deliver and manage. The virtual school market is a relatively new area within the broader K-12 education market. As a result, there is a growing need for a high quality, trusted, national education offering for this demographic Furthermore, parents are seeking much more robust and comprehensive ongoing assessments than is currently offered in the public schools, in order to assess their children's progress both on a relative and an absolute basis. 8.5. The International Education Industry The leading authority on the worldwide education industry, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization ("UNESCO"), estimates that average public expenditures on education across the world increased from 4.1% of GNP in 1990 to 4.5% in 2000. In developing countries the increased government focus on education is more pronounced as public education expenditures rose to 4.1% in 2000 from 3.5% in 1990. Based on global gross national income of $48 trillion, KUE estimates that the global education market opportunity is greater than $2.4 trillion driven by the following factors: • Large population of school-aged children in parts of the world. The opportunity for pre-K-12 education is particularly strong in certain countries with high fertility rates. Examples of such opportunities include India, where mothers give birth to an average of 2.78 children. Increases in the population of children coupled with an increased awareness of the economic and social benefits of education are expected to lead to significant growth in the global ECE market. 2 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005 and Charter School Leadership Council and Center for Education Reform. 69 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024502

• Increased government focus on education. In many countries, per student public spending on education represents a larger portion of per capita GDP than in the U.S. For example, in Australia and the United Kingdom, the government has subsidized a large portion of ECE. Now, countries such as Saudi Arabia are developing similar programs. The opportunity for increased government spending on pre-K-12 education is particularly apparent in growing economies such as China and South Korea as those countries increase their share of world GDP. • Potential opportunities in countries with declining populations. In countries that have had low fertility rates for several generations, such as Japan and Italy, there often exists a large family structure supporting a single child. KUE believes that this leads to several family members (e.g., both parents and grandparents) contributing to a single child's schooling, resulting in higher education expenditures per child. In addition, the high cost and limited availability of quality ECE in countries such as Japan has been identified as a contributing factor to declining birth rates in the country. The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of some of the key markets around the world, which KUE views as attractive. These include China, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. 8.5.1 China: Market Overview With a population of 274 million children under age 15, and a fertility rate of 1.73, China represents an attractive market for early education providers. In China, mandatory education starts with primary schools, at which most children enroll by age six. Currently, 24 million Chinese children are attending kindergarten as a growing middle class and the one-child policy are driving multiple incomes to one child and increasing the amount of capital that can be dedicated to education. These socioeconomic factors are reflected in the increasing numbers of private kindergartens, which have grown at a rate of 13% over the past eight years. 13.7% 17.7% 25.1% 0.7% Public versus Private Pre-School Education 20.1% 19.7% 0.5% 8.7% 14.7% 150 150 181 182 172 87 1995 1098 2001 Private Schools • Total Schools 2002 2003 Private Growth 1994 1995 1996 1997 1999 2000 2001 • All Kindergartens • Private Kindergartens 2002 Note: Private kindergarten enrollment data unavailable before 1998. Source: Ministry of Education, China Education Industry Development Statistics Report, China Education and Research Network. 2003 Schools tend to be concentrated in larger cities with Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao and Guangzhou being the largest pre-school markets. Kindergartens are divided into three categories: Bilingual, Foreign language and Mandarin. Bilingual kindergartens are typically joint ventures between Chinese and foreign entities or owned wholly by Chinese private or public entities. Tuitions for bilingual programs can reach $15,000 per year. Foreign language kindergartens are wholly owned foreign schools that recruit only foreign students and are typically backed by their embassies. These schools adhere to foreign educational standards with Mandarin being taught as a second language. The tuitions of foreign language schools range from $10,000 to $22,000 per year. Mandarin kindergartens are typically owned by Chinese public entities. 30 Source: Central Intelligence Agency, World Factbook 2006. 31 Source: Ministry of Education, China Education Industry Development Statistics Report, China Education and Research Network. 70 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024503

Kindergartens can be set up by the Ministry of Education, private enterprises, universities, communities and individuals. While local governments establish the minimum and maximum fees allowed to be charged by public kindergartens, private schools are allowed to dictate "reasonable" tuition levels. Overview of the Major Themes in Education Market in China Only accept non-PRC citizens Very high tuition (=US$10,000 per year) Free to use any curriculum International Usually affiliated with overseas schools Examples: Shanghai American School, Yew Chung Shanghai International School, British International School "Elite" Public Public schools with premium facilities and teaching resources Very difficult to enter (usually requires "guanxi") Tuition itself not necessarily high, but "sponsorship fee" can be COCONA Examples: Song Qing Lin Kindergarten, Dong Fang Kindergarten Private Increasing in numbers over the past few years Mostly run by locals, but foreign participation is on the rise Quality and tuition vary considerably Examples: Elizabeth Kindergarten (local), Victoria Wah Kwong Kindergarten (Hong Kong).

Open to every citizen, the system provides students with free education, books and health services. The government allocates over 25% of the annual State budget to education. According to the Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia prizes education because of its critical importance in developing the country's human potential. Education is a central aspect of family and community life. Parents are deeply involved in their children's education, and the close links between home and school serve to reinforce the structure of the community and the nation. The government plans to increase the enrollment of 4 to 6-year-olds to 40% by 2014.32 Additionally, by royal decree, education is now required for all 4-year-olds. New labor laws also necessitate that companies employing 50 or more women provide daycare centers. Despite this new series of laws, there still only exist 1,200 kindergarten schools in Saudi Arabia (42% private and 58% public) to support the legislative pronouncements. The Company anticipates that, additional capacity will be needed to meet these social objectives. These trends, as noted by the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia have led to private education facilities opening all over the Kingdom. 8.5.3 United Kingdom: Market Overview The United Kingdom stands out with consistent rises in its investment in education, not just in absolute terms, but also relative to national income: Spending on educational institutions increased from 4.3% of GDP in 1990 to 5.5% in 1995 and 5.9% in 2002. From 1995 to 2002, spending and enrollment in priman and secondary education has also increased by 36% and 21%, respectively. • Additionally. the countr invests almost twice as much as any other country at the pre-primary level.

year-olds and under as a percentage of the 3-to-4-year-old population has also increased from 51% in 1998 to 77% in 2002. The U.K. government is focused on the ECE industry and expects to spend $18 billion on child care schemes in the near future through "Sure Start", an initiative designed to encourage additional participation in high quality childcare through extensive subsidies. The government's intention is to create 3,500 additional children's centers in un-serviced, low-income communities.

9. KNOWLEDGE UNIVERSE EDUCATION ("KUE") KUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world. KUE currently operates in the U.S. and is the indirect parent company (87.6% ownership) of KLC and also a major shareholder (owns 17.9% to 40.0% of equity) of k12. In November 2005, KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its real estate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (KLC PropCo) and all of its customer contracts and operations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (KLC OpCo). The controlling shareholders of the General Partner are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green (collectively the "Principals"). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of experience in the education sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. teven Green, a former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as a nternational industrialist leadina major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing housing, consumer products, retail and real estate enterprises. The Principals founded KUE and its affiliated companies over the past decade based on their vision of a world where competition for human capital is becoming the driving force of economic prosperity. KUE represents the Principals' sole vehicle for equity investment opportunities in the early education through secondary school sector going forward. The Company has an accomplished and internationally recognized leadership team. Led by the Principals, the Company has a prominent management team and advisory board with significant financial resources and substantial experience in the fields of education and real estate management. Additionally, through its past experiences at KLC, the Company has demonstrated the ability to acquire and integrate education assets. The Company's management consists of people with diverse backgrounds in operations, corporate finance, real estate, government relations and education. KUE's role will be to oversee the portfolio of operating businesses, identify acquisition candidates, hire top level management of the operating businesses and help the portfolio companies navigate some of the legislative and regulatory matters that exist in K-12 education. These services will be performed for the Company by KULG, for which KUE will pay $20.0 million annually to KULG in quarterly installments beginning July 1, 2006 pursuant to the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement. See "Related Party Transactions." Ine General Partner plans to have a Board of Directors (the "Board") with representatives from some o he countries KUE plans to expand into, public policy experts and independent directors witl complementary backgrounds. KUE expects to benefit from the breadth and depth of the knowledge, experience and expertise of the Board.

The term loan facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KUE LL's direct and indirect parents and the parent guaranty is several. Upon contribution of assets to KUE by KUE LLC, KUE will become a co- borrower. It is expected that this Term Loan Facility will be repaid with the proceeds of this offering. The term loan bears interest at either the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 0.125% or the base rate (generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time), at KUE's option and is secured by cash collateral. KUE is permitted to voluntarily prepay the term loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon the giving of proper notice. 74 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024507

10. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF KLC's PRO FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In January 2005, KLC acquired KinderCare and incurred $540 million of term debt (the "Acquisition Term Debt") and $250 million of subordinated bridge debt to finance the acquisition. At the time of the KinderCare acquisition, KinderCare had approximately $300 million of nonrecourse mortgage debt outstanding (the "KinderCare CMBS Debt"). KLC refinanced the bridge debt in February 2005 with $260 million of 7-3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015 (the "Notes"). In November 2005, KLC completed a transaction (the "Real Estate Transaction") in which KLC divided its business, with substantially all of its real estate owned by special purpose subsidiaries (collectively, KLC PropCo) and all of its customer contracts and operations remaining at KLC and certain other subsidiaries (collectively, KLC OpCo). Management believes that this division represents the best way to analyze the business going forward. In connection with the Real Estate Transaction, KLC PropCo entities incurred $650 million of mortgage debt, $50 million of senior mezzanine debt and $150 million of junior mezzanine debt, which indebtedness is nonrecourse to KLC OpCo, the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay the Acquisition Term Debt and the KinderCare CMBS Debt, and KLC PropCo leased its owned centers back to KLC OpCo. See "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005, 2004 and 2003" in Appendix B, "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended April 1, 2006" in Appendix C, "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, 2006" in Appendix D and Notes 11 and 21 to KLC's Financial Statements in Appendix E. The discussion below presents the pro forma results of consolidated KLC (KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo) as if the KinderCare acquisition and the Real Estate Transaction occurred on January 1, 2004. The pro forma results are not adjusted for the costs of operating KLC and KinderCare in parallel for a significant portion of 2005, or for restructuring costs incurred in combining the two businesses. These and other items are reflected as adjustments to EBITDA in our presentation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. Our pro forma results for KLC were not prepared in conformity with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the SEC (which would not, among other limitations, permit a 2004 pro forma presentation after completion of our 2005 financial statements). In addition, by presenting a pro forma comparison, this discussion and analysis does not include a comparison of KLC's historical GAAP consolidated operating results or segment information that would be required by Item 3-03 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. The presentation of non-GAAP information herein does not purport to comply with Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K or Regulation G of the SEC. For further information see "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended 2005. 2004 and 2003" in Appendix B, "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended April 1, 2006" in Appendix C, "KLC: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the Quarterly Period Ended July 1, 2006" in Appendix D and the KLC and KinderCare GAAP financial statements in Appendix E. The pro forma presentation is not shown with adjustments to historical financial statements. Instead, it is ased on a "ground up" combination of corporate level expenditures (overhead and capital expenditures and internal financial statements derived from a center-by-center build up of KLC's results. The primar reasons for the presentation based on internal reports instead of KLC and KinderCare financial statements are the different fiscal year ends and expense classifications between KLC and KinderCare. The "ground up" analysis presented is consistent with management's view of the business. Key Operating Variables Net Revenue Trends and Drivers 75 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024508

The vast majority of KL's net revenues are derived from center operations. The trends and drivers discussed below relate to such center operations. KLC derives its net revenues primarily from the tuition it charges for attendance by children at its centers. KLC's tuition rates and net revenues can be significantly impacted by the enrollment characteristics at its centers. Key factors include (1) geographic location, because KLC can command higher tuition rates in certain geographic areas; (2) the age mix of children enrolled, because tuition rates depend on the age of the child and are generally higher for younger children; (3) the mix between full-and part-time attendance, because KLC charges comparatively higher rates for part-time enrollment and (4) the level of participation in government subsidy and discount programs. KLC calculates its average weekly tuition rate as the actual tuition charged at centers that are open at the calculation date, net of discounts, for a specified time period, divided by average "full-time equivalents," or "FTEs" for the related time period. KLC's FTEs are calculated by dividing net revenue by the center's undiscounted average pre-school tuition rate. FTEs do not necessarily reflect the actual number of full- and part-time children enrolled. Tuition rates at KLC's centers are typically adjusted once per year to coincide with the back-to-school period. KLC typically collects tuition on a weekly basis in advance, the majority of which is paid by individual families. KLC provides discounts to government agencies, employees, families with multiple enrollments, referral sources and organizations KLC partners with for its employer-sponsored centers. In its employer-sponsored centers, tuition may be partly subsidized by such employers. Approximately 20% of KLC's net revenues are derived from tuition paid at varying levels of subsidy by government agencies. KLC's revenues are therefore affected by changes in the levels of government support for education, which are negatively impacted by weak economic conditions and resulting budget pressure at federal, state and local governments. KLC reports comparable center revenue trends based on the centers (other than the employer-sponsored centers operated for a management fee) that were open in both periods. Comparable center net revenues do not include revenues generated from centers that have been closed or sold. Utilization is a measure of the utilization of center capacity. KLC calculates utilization as the total actual child care revenues earned at centers that are open at the calculation date divided by the total potential child care revenue (based upon the center's undiscounted pre-school tuition rate and the center's total licensed capacity) during the related time period. In addition to tuition charges, KLC records revenues from fees and other income in a majority of its centers.

KLC attempts to focus its marketing efforts to support these periods of high reenrollments. Enrollment generally decreases somewhat during the summer months and the calendar year-end holidays. Results Discussion Revenue increased to $1.48 billion in 2005, which represents an increase of $35.6 million over 2004. Gross margin was $340.7 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $11.1 million, or 3.4%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, was $238.0 million which was $6.6 million, or 2.9%, above the same period in 2004. 77 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024510

During the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, revenue increased $35.6 million, or 25%, over the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to tuition rate increases, which took effect in January 2005 and September 2005, offset by the impact of center closures and a slight decline in Utilization. However, during the third quarter of 2005 Utilization levels increased versus the same period in 2004, from 59.3% to 60.3%. This positive Utilization trend was repeated in the fourth quarter of 2005 as levels rose to 59.2% versus 58.9% in the comparable period of 2004. Management believes these improvements reflect stronger economic conditions, strong back-to-school enrollments, marketing efforts and other management initiatives and programs. ECE revenue increased $24.9 million, or 1.8%, in the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period of 2004.

Rent increased by $8.0 million to $121.1 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004. The increase in rent was largely due to a center sale- leaseback program conducted by KinderCare during 2004, prior to its acquisition by KLC. Pro forma rent does not include $96.3 million of intercompany rent payable by KLC OpCo to KLC PropCo as a result of the Real Estate Transaction. Other costs include costs directly associated with the centers such as business insurance, food, marketing, maintenance, utilities, transportation and classroom and office supplies. Other costs were $281.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $274.4 million in the same period last year. Other costs were 19.0% of revenue during both years. General and administrative expenses, which include costs associated with the field and corporate oversight and support of KLC's centers, were $126.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, compared to $126.4 million for the same period in 2004 General and administrative expenses included the substantial majority of estimated temporary parallel organization costs of $28.1 million and $23.3 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively, as discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $238.0 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2006 compared to $231.4 million in 2004. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of slightly higher revenue and gross margin improvements enhanced by lower general and administrative costs before non-cash SAR accruals, net of restructuring charges and parallel organization costs. The table summarizes KLC's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as defined in KLC's existing revolving credit agreement.

" Management fee paid to affiliate entities. Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, were $29.4 million. Included in the $29.4 million of non-recurring integration costs were $11.0 million of severance costs that resulted primarily from the closure of KLC's former corporate offices at Golden, CO. Additional restructuring costs in 2005 were the result of consulting, temporary contract-based labor and other charges. Restructuring charges in 2004 were $5.1 million and were related to KLC's acquisition of AER in May 2003. Parallel Organization Costs. For much of 2005 KLC was burdened with the central operations and infrastructure of both KinderCare and KLC. KLC has defined parallel organization costs as the cost of maintaining these duplicative corporate functions during the overhead rationalization associated with the KinderCare acquisition. KLC believes that approximately 70% of parallel organization costs are related to salaries. Remaining parallel organization costs are related to upkeep, maintenance and utilities at corporate facilities. During the first month of 2006 parallel organization costs had been reduced to $174,042 (annualized run-rate of $2.1 million) compared to an estimated $23.3 million in 2005. Parallel organization costs for the 2004 fiscal year are estimated based on an annualized run-rate based on the costs incurred during the first month following the KinderCare acquisition. During that month (January 2005), KLC incurred approximately $2.3 million of parallel organization costs ($28.1 million on an annualized run-rate basis). Interest. Interest expense in 2004 and 2005 is almost identical because both years are pro forma for the financings associated with the Real Estate Transaction, which refinanced the indebtedness incurred to finance the KinderCare acquisition. In 2005 pro forma interest expense of $89.9 million includes $5.1 million of non-cash interest expense. Actual interest expense during the 2005 fiscal year was $80.7 million which did not include $32.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt. 80 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024513

In addition, KLC spent $9.8 million in 2004 on corporate infrastructure improvements, primarily IT spending compared to $14.0 million in 2005. The remainder of KLC's capital expenditures was used to expand KLC's center base through both purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment and construction of new owned centers. 81 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024514

11. THE OPERATING COMPANY ('KLC OPCO") KLC's mission is to provide a quality education to children from birth to college. KLC was formed from the combination of KLC and AER which occurred in May 2003 and the subsequent acquisition of KinderCare in January of 2005. Based in Portland, Oregon, KLC consists of (i) KLC OpCo, a collection of operating companies and (ii) KLC PropCo, a collection of special purpose subsidiaries owning substantially all of KLC's real estate. 11.1. KLC OpCo KLC OpCo is the largest for-profit provider of ECE and care services in the U.S., the second largest provider of employer-sponsored ECE to the corporate segment in the U.S. and the largest for-profit provider of before and after school programs in the U.S. Through one of its subsidiaries, KLC OpCo also operates accredited high school distance learning programs that have served over 200,000 students since 1975. On a pro forma basis for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,477.7 million and $149.9 million, respectively. KLC OpCo Business Units KLC OpCo Early Childhood Education ("ECE") (Community (Employer Centers) Sponsored Centers) 1,812 centers 122 centers 90% of Pro Forma 6% of Pro Forma Reventip School Partnerships (Before and after school care) 573 sites 3% of Pro Forma Revenue Distance Learning (Online Education) 1% of Pro Forma Revenue 11.2. Early Childhood Education Unit (96% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) As of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo provided ECE services through its 1,812 company-operated community centers (90% of pro forma revenue) and 122 employer-sponsored centers (6% of pro forma revenue). In total the ECE Unit operated 1,934 centers in 39 states and Washington D.C., offering ECE programs primarily for children aged six weeks to five years. The programs are marketed primarily under the KinderCare, Children's World, Children's Discovery Centers, Knowledge Beginnings and Mulberry Child Care & Preschool brand names. KLC OpCo's centers typically contain classrooms, recreational areas, kitchens and bathroom facilities The centers usually accommodate the grouping of children according to age. The centers have outdoor playgrounds, often with separate areas designed for infants and toddlers, with the exception of some downtown urban centers that may utilize nearby parks. Each center is equipped with a variety of audio and visual aids, educational supplies, games, toys and indoor and outdoor play equipment. In addition, most of the centers are equipped with personal computers with programs specifically designed for both pre-school and school-age children. The typical center can serve between 120-140 students, although actual enrollments can be higher as some children are enrolled on a part-time basis. Children are usually enrolled on a weekly basis for either full-day or half-day sessions. Most centers provide enrolled children with meals and two snacks. 82 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024515

KLC OpCo provides a wide range of quality programs that are continuously updated to reflect current thinking and to meet the needs of individual children. Programs have been developed in conjunction with nationally recognized experts in ECE and various curricula reflect the latest research in brain development. Programs stimulate the social, emotional, intellectual and physical needs of children and each program is age appropriate. KLC OpCo's ECE facilities are generally open throughout the year, usually five days a week, from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. New enrollments are most often highest in September and January, with the largest decrease in enrollment during holiday periods and summer months. Many centers offer summer day camp programs for children up to the age of 12. Additionally, many centers offer "back-up" care, which is offered in the event that the parent's primary child care arrangement is unavailable (e.g., when an in- home provider goes on vacation). The company will provide short-term child care until the parent's child Community Centers The 1,812 community centers are located in diverse demographic locations. Newly built centers tend to be located in the targeted demographic market of newer upper-middle class to upper income suburban areas with high concentrations of dual income families. In a community center, the current weekly tuition rates for full-day service range from $90 to $400 per child, depending upon the center location and the age of the child. KLC OpCo also offers tutorial programs in areas such as literacy, reading, foreign languages and mathematics in many of its centers for a supplemental fee and is exploring offering additional supplemental fee programs. Tuition is generally paid in advance on a weekly basis and, to a lesser extent, on a monthly basis. The company typically sets tuition for half-day programs at a 20% to 40% premium compared with an equal number of hours for a full-day program. Approximately 20% of tuition is paid under state and federal subsidy programs. Employer-Sponsored Centers As of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo operated 122 corporate or employer-sponsored centers. These centers are typically free-standing, and are located at or near the premises or campus of the employer-sponsor. These sites are different from community centers in that they usually have more square footage per child and larger staff areas. Generally, the corporate sponsor provides the constructed building. KLC OpCo currently has relationships with a diverse group of employers, including hospitals, health care facilities, government agencies, and private sector companies. Its corporate relationships include, but are not limited to, the following: AOL Time Warner, TRW, Lockheed Martin, the World Bank Group, Fox, Maytag, Northrop, TJ Maxx, the National Security Agency, the Mayo Clinic and basis (91 centers). Under the former, KLC OpCo receives a fixed fee per month, typically irrespective of tuition subsidies, free or reduced rent, the provision of certain services such as maintenance, landscaping and janitorial services or enrollment guarantees. This enables the company to utilize the subsidies for improved staff quality and teacher / child ratios. Contract terms typically average between one and five years. Normally the management centers are reserved for children of the corporations' employees. Some contracts provide for accepting non- employee children, for which the company can often charge a higher tuition. 83 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024516

11.3. School Partnerships Unit (3% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) Through the School Partnerships Unit, KLC OpCo provides customized before and after school educational enrichment and recreational programs for school age and preschool children in partnership These before and after school programs are typically conducted in collaboration with public schools and located on-site at public school campuses. The success of the programs has led to the development of summer camps, remedial programs, and drop-in care. Programs are operated under the Champions name. Because each program is relatively small (approximately 40 children per program), operating costs associated with running each program are minimal. Little or no capital investment is required and the contracting school typically provides on-site space for the program. Contract tenures range from one year to evergreen. They often stipulate that KLC pays minimum fees to the elementary schools for use of KLC OpCo's November 2004 acquisition of EdSolutions, Inc. ("ESI") provided it entry into the Supplemental Education Services ("SES") tutoring business. The SES business is part of the federal No Child Left Behind Act's effort to improve the performance of students at failing schools. KLC OpCo operates 72 SES sites. ESI is approved to provide SES in 19 states and our plans call for ESI to serve as a platform for future growth for KLC. 11.4. Distance Learning (1% of Pro Forma FYE December 31, 2005 Revenue) Through its wholly owned subsidiary, KCDL, KLC OpCo also operates accredited high school distance learning programs that have served over 200,000 students since 1975. Based in Portland, Oregon, KCDL operates Keystone National High School and iQ Academies. Keystone National High School is one of the largest and most experienced accredited high school distance learning programs in the country. Keystone is a private, diploma granting school with parents or schools paying for individual courses and/or complete curriculum. Keystone served over 14,000 students in 2005 and offers more than 60 distance learning courses. iQ Academies develops and manages online charter schools. It currently operates one school in Wisconsin, is working on the approval process for another charter in California, and has plans to begin several more charters in the next 12 months. iQ Academies provides support required to launch and operate an online high school including curriculum, instruction, technology, marketing and support. Though only 1% of KLC OpCo's pro forma revenues, KCDL is highly profitable and accounts for almost 2% of KLC OpCo's pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. 11.5. Business Strategy KLC OpCo's strategy is to drive revenue growth and enhance profitability through a combination of the following initiatives: = Expansion of existing business lines. Management believes that the opportunity exists to significantly expand the scope of its existing business lines: - Community centers. KLC OpCo has substantial experience in selecting and opening new community centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 195 new centers which are expected to generate approximately $200 million of gross revenue. - Employer-sponsored centers. KLC OpCo expects to continue the expansion of its employer ponsored centers. Over the next six years KLC OpCo plans to open 124 new centers with gros revenue of approximately $120 million. 84 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024517

• Rationalize centers to improve overall strategy and quality of network. Management closely monitors underperforming centers and looks to rationalization opportunities which generally lead to improved Utilization and higher EBITDA generation. - As part of its rationalization, KLC OpCo has identified 50 centers which it intends to close and will continue to evaluate underperforming centers. As a result, over the next six years KLC OpCo expects to close approximately 250 centers with a decrease in revenues of approximately $120 the closure of underperforming centers decreases KLC OpCo's revenue, rationalization is expected to increase both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins. • Strategic acquisitions. The childcare market remains highly fragmented with for-profit chains comprising only 5% of the entire market. There are over 386,000 family-owned and operated centers, with each providing services to fewer than 13 children. KLC OpCo believes there are many opportunities to consolidate some of the family-run centers as well as some of the larger regional providers. • Offer new products and services. KLC OpCo estimates that it services more than 200,000 families in a given year. KLC OpCo's scope of operations makes it ideally positioned to market other products and services through its learning centers. KLC OpCo has already sold several additional lines of educational products and services at test locations including supplemental phonics, math, Spanish and music courses. KLC OpCo believes that product and service lines can be expanded to include additional educational and non-educational offerings such as medical insurance and student financing * Going ane prem as a ped pr • Initiation of the Spirit of Service Program. The fundamental assumption of the Spirit of Service program is that sales are not separate from service-both are driven by relationships. To that end, the Spirit of Service program was designed to promote revenue growth by building a sales-oriented culture while increasing customer / parent engagement. Currently, KLC OpCo's management team is working with consultants from Cypress Consulting and the Gallup Organization to: - Understand and evaluate current practices and expectations regarding sales and service; — Provide reliable data to help grow enrollments through a better understanding of families who have disenrolled and KLC OpCo's current customers; — Develop the sales and coaching skill necessary to support requisite practices and behaviors; and _ Institutionalize practices, systems and incentive plans to ensure a sustainable focus and culture built around sales and customer service. 11.6. Sales and Marketing Early Childhood Care and Education Community Centers. KLC OpCo's target market is middle-class to affluent ($70,000+ household income), highly educated parents working or residing near the center. Target parents are white-collar workers and are usually dual-income families. KLC looks for sites where it believes the market for its services will support tuition rates higher than current average rates. Management believes KLC OpCo distinguishes its services by developing and introducing high quality curricula and programs that incorporate both learning and enjoyable activities held in a safe and child-friendly environment. KLC OpCo markets its services through online channels (including strategic click through advertisement placements), as well as traditional methods, such as display advertisements, Muna, and cater open repre of an al anot listings in the yellow pages, newspaper advertisements, distribution of flyers at schools and community functions, and center open house events. KLC OpCo spends a large portion of its advertising budget during the summer months in anticipation of the fall enrollment period, with continued advertising throughout the year. The primary source of new enrollments is recommendations from customers in the communities in which KLC OpCo operates. Center directors are also involved in the marketing process 85 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024518

by encouraging parental involvement in the centers through monthly newsletters and reports, parent-teacher conferences and parental visits to, and inspections of, the centers. Although most of the marketing efforts are performed at the field level, corporate headquarters assists centers in developing marketing programs, designing campaigns, preparing marketing brochures, strengthening the brand name, identifying strategic partners, and providing advice on ways to advertise and market the programs at the local level. In addition, KLC OpCo is actively involved in teaching the staff and directors business enhancing skills, such as cost management, local marketing and customer Employer-Sponsored Centers. Services that KLC OpCo provides to employers include onsite and near- site center operation, backup care, discount programs, holiday care and consulting services. KLC OpCo has dedicated sales personnel focused on expanding its presence in this market. It also markets its services through relationships with consultants, attendance and presentations with clients at trade shows, networking at conferences and through industry alliances and publications. KLC OpCo responds to requests for proposals, referrals from current clients and prospects to targeted mid-market centers for transition opportunities through mailings and networking. It also targets Fortune 1000 companies for its discount and nationwide backup care services which serve large distributed workforces. Marketing to employers or corporate sponsors largely takes place at the corporate level. KLC OpCo markets to parents through its employer sponsors and occasionally through contracted resource and referral agencies. KLC OpCo is finding that the preferred method is through electronic brochures and messages as well as dedicated websites for onsite centers and services. KLC OpCo provides hardcopy materials and promotional giveaways primarily through employer-sponsored benefit fairs and events on client campuses. The centers engage parents and potential parents through brown bag lunch seminars, open houses, and visibility tables in client cafeterias and common areas. School Partnerships Champions Programs. KLC OpCo positions its Champions school age, preschool and summer programs as exciting combinations of learning and fun. It relies primarily on a regional, direct sales force in effecting a two tiered sales and marketing approach. The first tier consists of selling the Champions service at the appropriate administrative level in the school. This selling generally occurs at the superintendent or principal level. Selling to administrators is necessary since the majority of Champions' programs rely solely on the use of existing school infrastructure. The sales and marketing effort in this tier involves participation in trade shows, featured articles in trade journals, trade magazine advertising and news releases. KLC OpCo believes that these efforts have been successful in heightening brand awareness, and as such, has enabled its sales force to gain access to entire districts versus individual Once a Champions program receives the endorsement of the appropriate decision-maker, the second tier of the sales and marketing effort begins, which targets the parents of children attending the sponsor school and, in some cases, nearby schools. Marketing is conducted primarily through flyers, open houses and school newsletters. Supplemental Education Services. The sales and marketing process for SES tutoring involves several steps. First, KLC OpCo must seek approval to provide services in a state through a request-for-proposal process. This process entails detailed descriptions of the curriculum provided and how it correlates with state standards, testing and accountability, the operational model to be provided and company background information. Once approval is obtained at the state level, KLC OpCo contacts districts it is interested in serving, and requests that it be added to the list of approved providers. At the same time that it makes the initial contact with districts, it also contacts local schools, often through such schools' SES coordinator, and subsequently with the parents at each school. Once KLC OpCo has been approved by the state, district and the schools, it competes with multiple SES providers selling to individual parents, who are the ultimate decision makers in terms of selecting a 86 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024519

provider. Many providers are currently offering incentives to children and families to enroll with them and some are offering incentives to schools as well. The key challenge in marketing the SES programs to families is offering something that is appropriate and that will add educational value for families while enticing the children to participate. KLC OpCo believes there is a much larger number of children eligible for services than the number that attend programs and therefore an opportunity exists to improve marketing and outreach to families. Identifying prospects involves targeting urban areas where there is a cluster of failing schools. Failing schools are schools that fail to meet established NCB requirements for three years in a row. After the second year of failure the schools have to offer several services in order to prevent being named a failing school. This enables KLC OpCo to project the approximate number of schools that will be considered failing in the next school year and help identify states to pursue and markets that warrant further attention. KLC OpCo is currently authorized to provide SES in 19 states and has already begun providing SES in five of them. KLC OpCo believes the SES business provides an opportunity for growth. On August 29, 2006, KLC acquired 100% of the membership interests in Education Station, LLC ("Education Station") from Catapult Learning LLC ("Catapult"), a subsidiary of Educate, Inc. (together with Catapult, "Educate") Education Station is a private provider of supplemental educational services under the NCLB and other educational instruction and after school services. The purchase agreement provides for an aggregate purchase price of $6.0 million with $3.0 million paid into escrow at closing, and $1.0 million payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date. The amount in escrow is payable to Educate on three specific dates during the period beginning ninety days from the closing date and ending on July 31, 2007 upon the renewal by Education Station of certain contracts which were in place applicable to the 2005-2006 school year. Also on August 29, 2006, KLC and Educate entered into a technology license agreement where Educate granted a license to KLC of certain proprietary software used in providing real-time online NCB services. The term of the license agreement is four years and provides for a license fee of $10 million payable in three installments of $3.0 million within 30 days following each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date and a final installment of $1 million within 30 days following the fourth anniversary. KLC believes that the acquisition of Education Station makes it the largest for-profit provider of supplemental education services under the NCB in the U.S. Distance Learning KLC OpCo markets its distance learning products to two distinct customer groups: the home school market and schools. Purchases made into the home school market are driven by web-based marketing efforts and trade associations along with a direct mail campaign. Purchases made by schools are marketed to counselors and administrators through direct mail and telemarketing efforts. 11.7. Curriculum KLC OpCo believes that it can increase enrollment in its centers by continuing to develop and introduce high quality curricula and programs that provide parents with meaningful reasons to choose the centers for their children over other alternatives. It has designed research-based, proprietary curricula for age- specific educational and recreational programs to develop a child's social, intellectual and physical skills and distributed curriculum manuals for each age group to its centers. These programs are used as ramework, within which individual teachers have flexibility to create daily instruction opportunities that ar tailored to the needs of each class. The curriculum covered by the "Early Foundations" program is carefully designed to support school readiness. Activities are developed and implemented based on an expansive, research-based framework of educational objectives. These objectives mirror well documented early learning standards. Frequent assessment insures both program quality and desirable child outcomes. 87 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024520

The Early Foundations program focuses on providing individual learning opportunities that are flexible and appropriate to each child's development level. KLC OpCo believes that the Early Foundations program distinguishes the Company from other child care providers. 11.8. Management Team and Board of Directors KLC OpCo is led by a highly experienced management team comprised of experts in the field of education, as well as business professionals. This combination of talent is expected to drive continued success of KLC OpCo. These individuals are also supported by a seasoned executive and middle management team with average Company tenure of ten years.

11.9. Employees As of December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo employed approximately 40,000 non-unionized personnel. Of the total amount, 39,639 are employed at the field level (including teachers and center staff, center directors, facilities and field and regional staff) and 592 are employed at the corporate level. Given the seasonality of the child care business and the regulated teacher-student ratio that varies by age with each state, approximately 16.5% of the total field personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Teachers and teaching assistants, which account for 93% of the total employee pool, are paid on an hourly basis. Most of KLC OpCo's remaining employees, including District Managers as well as most corporate staff, are salaried. KLC believes that its relations with its employees are good. KLC OpCo's management believes that its below-industry average turnover rates are a result of its hiring practices and closer involvement in center operations, a focus on treating teachers as educators and not just employees, and comprehensive training programs that are designed to ensure that teachers are successful. KLC OpCo believes that it has the opportunity to reduce employee turnover further through improved recruiting, training and management. The following table presents a breakdown of employees as of December 31, 2005: KLC Employee Breakdown Employee Type Teachers and Center Staff Center Directors Corporate Facilities Field / Regional Staff Total Number 37,440 1,874 592 218 107 40,231 11.10. Accreditation KLC OpCo pursues accreditation of its centers by accrediting bodies, primarily the National Association for the Education of Young Children (referred to herein as "NAEY"), the nation's leading child care accreditation body. NAEYC accreditation criteria cover a wide range of quantitative and qualitative factors, including, among others, faculty qualifications and development, staffing ratios, health and safety and physical environment. NAEYC criteria generally are more stringent than state regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo had 831 or approximately 43% of its total ECE centers that were accredited by NAEYC. Of the approximately 117,000 licensed centers in the U.S., approximately 10% are accredited by NAEYC. Management believes that substantially all of its centers' operations and policies adhere to or are substantially compliant with NAEYC accreditation requirements. Since the accreditation process is expensive, KLC OpCo intends to seek accreditation only where it believes accreditation will provide meaningful local marketing benefits or competitive advantages. 11.11. Licensing and Government Regulation Each early childhood care and education center and most school programs must be licensed under applicable state or local licensing laws. Responsibility for licensing and compliance with government regulations is at the regional and local level. Licenses are held at the center level or by the school program and are typically good for a minimum of one year. Generally, the center or school program will 89 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024522

reapply for a license on an annual basis, and that process may include a visit from the applicable state regulator. Renewal of a license is generally a fairly routine process. In addition, each ECE center or school program is subject to a variety of state and local regulations. Although these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, governmental agencies generally review the safety, staff qualifications, fitness and adequacy of the buildings and equipment; the ratio of staff to children; the dietary program; the daily curriculum and compliance with health and transportation standards. In most jurisdictions, these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of failures by a location to comply with applicable regulations can subject it to sanctions that might include probation or, in more serious cases, suspension or revocation of the center's or program's license to operate and could also lead to sanctions against the Company's other centers or programs located in the same jurisdiction. In addition, this type of action could lead to negative publicity extending beyond that jurisdiction. KLC OpCo generally seeks to operate centers and school programs in states with strict regulations in order to avoid unexpected expense and market disruption that may be caused by compliance with regulations adopted in states that previously lacked such regulations. KLC OpCo believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all material regulations applicable to its business. However, a licensing authority may determine that a particular center or school program is in violation of applicable regulations and may take action against that center or program and In addition, there may be unforeseen changes in regulations and licensing requirements, such as changes in the required ratio of child center staff personnel to enrolled children, which could have a material adverse effect on KLC OpCo's operations. States in which KLC OpCo operates routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing requirements and implement changes which may significantly increase its costs to operate in those states. The SES programs are operated in substantial compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act, as well as applicable state Department of Education regulations that vary from state to state, but generally regulate curriculum, staff qualifications, and program quality and effectiveness. KLC OpCo must receive approval from each state's Department of Education in order to qualify as an SES provider. The length of approval to be an SES provider varies, but is typically from one to five years. Repeated failure by an SES provider to comply with regulations or its request for proposal documentation may cause the provider to lose its approval. Federal regulations and licensing requirements require compliance with minimum standards in order to qualify for participation in federal assistance programs. Under the Social Security Act, the U.S. federal government has established programs to assist low-income families with early childhood care and education expenses. These programs include the Childcare and Development Block Grant and At Risk Program. Funding is typically provided through block grants to states and counties, which then administer the programs through local agencies. The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, referred to as the ADA, and similar state laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Compliance with the neMA consis on ruleration made to commercia racies contrind desily guilines unless. structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. KLC OpCo has not Section 21 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), provides for an income tax credit ranging from 20% to 35% of certain child care expenses subject to certain maximum limitations. The fees paid to KLC OpCo for early childhood care and educational services by eligible taxpayers quality for the tax credit, subject to the limitations of the Code. In addition, Section 45F of the Code provides HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024523

incentives to families and employers to offset costs related to employer-provided child care facilities. However, these tax incentives are subject to change. KLC OpCo is also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime compensation and working conditions. All of KLC OpCo's employees are paid at rates equal to or higher than the federal minimum wage. KLC OpCo is also subject to laws regulating its transportation of children. In 1998, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, issued interpretive letters stating that automobile dealers may no longer sell 12 to 15-passenger vans intended to be used for the transportation of children to and from school by child care providers and that any vehicle designed to transport 11 persons or more must meet federal school bus standards if it is likely to be used significantly to transport children to and from school or school-related events. These interpretations and related changes in state and federal transportation regulations have affected the type of vehicle that the company may purchase for use in transporting children between schools and its centers and, in effect, required KLC OpCo to replace its remaining fleet of vans with school buses over time. These changes have increased the company's costs to transport children because school buses are more expensive to purchase and maintain and, in some jurisdictions, require drivers with commercial licenses. 11.12. Insurance KLC OpCo's insurance program currently includes the following types of policies: workers' compensation, commercial general liability, automobile liability, property, excess "umbrella" liability, directors' and officers' liability and employment practices liability. These policies provide for a variety of coverages, which are subject to various limits, and include substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions. Special insurance is sometimes obtained with respect to specific hazards, if deemed appropriate and available at a reasonable cost. Claims in excess of, or not included within, KLC's coverage may be asserted or coverage may not be available due to insurance company failures or other reasons. KLC OpCo maintained either a self-insured retention or a deductible for a portion of its general liability, workers' compensation, auto, property and employee medical insurance programs. It purchases stop loss coverage in order to mitigate its potential future losses. The nature of these liabilities, which may not fully manifest themselves for several years, requires significant judgment. KLC OpCo estimates the obligations for liabilities incurred but not yet reported or paid based on available claims data and historical trends and experience, as well as future projections of ultimate losses, expenses, premiums and administrative costs. While the company believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are sufficient, any significant increase in the number of claims and/or costs associated with claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 11.13. Legal Issues KLC OpCo does not believe that there are any pending or threatened legal proceedings that, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on its business or operations. However, it is subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims and litigation involving allegations of physical or sexual abuse of children. Although KLC OpCo cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome of the allegations, claims or lawsuits of which it is aware, it has not historically had to pay any claims exceeding its insurance coverage, and management believes that none of these allegations, claims or lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, operating results or cash flows. In addition, it cannot predict the negative impact of publicity that may be associated with any such allegation, claim or lawsuit. 91 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024524

11.14. Real Estate As a result of a November 9, 2005 Real Estate Transaction, substantially all of the real estate owned by KLC OpCo was transferred to KLC PropCo. Although the expectation is that newly acquired real estate will be owned by KLC PropCo and leased back to KLC OpCo, KLC OpCo continues to be actively involved in new center design, development and management. In addition to development of new centers, the team is responsible for maintaining existing centers. The real estate group within KLC OpCo is headed by Wayne Pipes, Vice President. 11.15. Environmental KLC OpCo is not aware of any existing environmental conditions that currently or in the future could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operating results or cash flows. It has not incurred material expenditures to address environmental conditions at any property. However, it has not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of its owned and leased centers. Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which it is unaware. In addition, future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability, and the current environmental condition of the centers may be adversely affected by conditions at locations in the vicinity of those centers (such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks) or by third parties unrelated to the company. 11.16. Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion The following summary historical and projected financial data should be read in conjunction with the and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of KLC's Pro Forma Results of Operations" presented elsewhere in this Memorandum. See also "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" elsewhere in this Memorandum for a discussion of the derivation and limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAR. The historical information is pro forma for the effects of the acquisition of KinderCare in January 2005 and the separation of KLC into KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo in November 2005, as if those transactions and related financing had occurred on January 1, 2004. KLC OpCo's pro forma results reflect KLC's consolidated pro forma results adjusted to include $96.3 million of rent expense payable to KLC PropCo. Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC OpCo's ability to perform as projected pends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty and actual performance cou e adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in "Risk Factors," particularly th risk factor related to projections elsewhere in this Memorandum.

Revenue Management projects revenue to increase at a 8.0% CAR, from $1.6 billion in 2006 to $2.3 billion in 2011. Most of the projected growth stems from KLC OpCo's ECE segment which currently accounts for approximately 96.0% of KLC OpCo's pro forma revenue. The following table shows projected revenue by business segment: 93 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024526

KLC OpCo projects that tuition rates at existing centers will grow at approximately 4% per year for the next five years. This growth is below recent experience (6.9% in 2005). Moreover, tuition rates in the industry have been growing at average rates of greater than 4%. Utilization improvement. Management projects that recent improvements witnessed at KLC OpCo will continue. By 2011, KLC OpCo projects Utilization will have increased to 65.2%. Management believes these improvements in Utilization will be the result of expected favorable demographic trends (described elsewhere in this Memorandum), new sales training programs, re-branding efforts in selected markets combined with the opening of appropriately sized centers. • New centers. KLC OpCo expects a net reduction of centers in 2006 and 2007 as it completes its integration of KinderCare and the rationalization of its properties. Beginning in 2008, KLC OpCo projects to be adding net centers.

The sale of additional products and services is expected to generate approximately 2.2% of total revenue in 2011, which is included in the ECE center projections. 94 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024527

School Partnerships School Partnerships is projected to grow from $48.5 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $138.1 million in 2011. As a percentage of revenue, School Partnerships accounts for 3.3% of total pro forma revenue in 2005, and is projected to grow to 6.0% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in the School Partnerships business will be primarily driven by growth in the SES market (more school districts required to offer supplemental services), and an increase in the number of parent pay locations in the U.S. KC Distance Learning KCDL is projected to grow from $10.0 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $41.6 million in 2011. As a percentage of revenue, KCDL accounts for 0.7% of total pro forma revenue in 2005, and is projected to grow to 1.8% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in this line will predominantly come from the forma revenue) and the expansion of states to digital high school courses (which KLC believes it is in a position to provide on an outsourced basis). Gross Margin KLC OpCo's pro forma gross profit is projected to increase from $244.4 million in 2005 to $501.3 million in 2011. The growth in gross profit is projected to be largely driven by increased center efficiency as a result of improved Utilization, continued tuition increases and the closure of underperforming centers and shift in the revenue mix to more profitable business lines (i.e., more employer-sponsored centers, KCDL, ancillary products and services). KLC OpCo's gross margin is projected to improve from approximately 16.5% of total revenues in fiscal year 2006 to 21.9% in fiscal year 2011 as a result of these factors. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Due to the relatively fixed nature of KLC OpCo's selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, KLC OpCo projects that SG&A will increase at a rate of 4.5% annually after 2006. Additionally, management estimates that there will be a one-time increase of $2.0 in SG&A related to the expansion of the SES business in 2007. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins KLC OpCo projects improving pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from $149.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to $320.1 million in fiscal year 2011. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve from 10.1% in fiscal year 2005 to 14.0% in fiscal year 2011. This proiected margin improvement reflects the combination of increasing sales and margin improvements outlined above.

Long Term Incentive Plan Our Adjusted EBITDA projections do not include the effect of any payments that may be made pursuant to our Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Under this new plan, which provides performance-based incentive compensation awards beginning in 2006 based on our performance against specific Adjusted EBITDA targets, we will accrue expenses ranging from $2.6 million in 2006 to $15.2 million in 2011 if our Adjusted EBITDA meets the projections set forth in this Memorandum. Each award is payable at the end of three years based on performance and subject to continued employment (with certain exceptions). The accrued expenses associated with an award in each period are non-cash, subject to cash settlement when and if the award for that period is earned at the end of the third year. The actual expenses could be higher or lower depending on whether actual Adjusted EBITDA performance exceeds or is less than the amounts projected herein. Working Capital KLC OpCo does not expect revenue or expenses to have a meaningful impact on working capital ratios in the future. 96 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024529

Capital Expenditures The following table shows the breakdown in KLC OpCo's projected capital expenditures: (S in millions) Maintenance New Centers (Furniture, Fixtures Equipment) IT Spending and Other Capex Total Capital Expenditures KLC OpCo 2006P $41.1 10.1 18.6 $69.9 2007P $40.8 7.2 12.2 $60.2 2008P $41.0 15.6 8.4 $65.0 2009P $41.8 22.5 8.6 $72.8 2010P $42.6 23.4 8.8 $74.8 2011P $43.5 24.0 9.0 $76.4 Between 2006 and 2011, KLC OpCo projects to spend between $41 million and $44 million annually on maintenance capital expenditures (approximately $22,000 on a per center basis), which includes refurbishment of its existing centers and equipment and supplies replacement costs. In addition, KLC OpCo expects to spend approximately $19 million in 2006 on corporate infrastructure improvements, primarily IT spending. The remainder of KLC's OpCo capital expenditures is projected to be used to expand KLC OpCo's center base. Beginning in 2007 KLC projects that it will only open leased centers; KLC OpCo believes that its cost of furnishing each center will be approximately $300,000 per center. 11.17. Debt Summary The table below shows KLC OpCo's outstanding debt as of December 31, 2005. KLC OpCo Debt Capitalization ($ in millions) Cash Revolver! Capital Leases Senior Subordinated Notes Total KLC OpCo Debt Net Debt "KLC OpCo has a $100 million revolver, primarily used to support outstanding letters of credit. 2 Represents total debt less cash. 12/31/05 $118.8 $0.0 16.4 260.0 $276.4 $157.6 11.18. Terms of Revolving Credit Facility In November 2005, KLC entered into a revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") with a syndicate of financial institutions consisting of a $100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility under which revolving and swingline loans may be made, and letters of credit may be issued in amounts up to $75.0 million. The Revolver is used for KLC's working capital and general corporate requirements. At December 31, 2005, KLC had no revolving loans outstanding and approximately $46.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Revolver. KLC pays a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum on the undrawn portion available under the Revolver and a fee of 1.25% per annum of the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit. 97 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024530

Borrowings under the Revolver will generally bear interest based on a margin over, at KLC OpCo's option, either the base rate (generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time) or the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin for revolving loans will be 0.25% for base rate loans and 1.25% for reserve adjusted LIBOR loans. KLC is permitted to voluntarily prepay principal amounts outstanding or reduce commitments under the Revolver at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The Revolver is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KSI and on a joint and several basis by most of KLC's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries within KLC OpCo. The Revolver and guarantees are secured by first priority security interests in, and liens on, substantially all of KLC OpCo's and the guarantors' assets and first priority pledges of all the equity interests owned by KSI in KLC and owned by KLC in its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries in KLC OpCo and 66% of the equity interests owned by KLC in its non-domestic subsidiaries. The revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financings of its type (with customary exceptions). The financial covenants include: a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test; a minimum leverage ratio test; a minimum interest coverage ratio test; and a minimum EBITDA test. Operating covenants limit KLC's and its restricted subsidiaries, and in certain cases, KSl's ability to (among others): incur additional debt; incur liens or other encumbrances; make investments; make acquisitions; incur certain contingent liabilities; make certain restricted junior payments and other similar distributions; enter into mergers, consolidations and similar combinations; sell assets or engage in similar transfers; open new learning centers; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; engage in businesses other than those in which KLC and its restricted subsidiaries and KSI were engaged at the time of the closing of the Revolver and other related or ancillary businesses; amend certain material agreements; prepay subordinated debt; sell or discount receivables; and dispose of any equity securities in its subsidiaries. 11.19. Terms of Senior Subordinated Notes In February 2005, KLC sold $260.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7¾% Senior Subordinated Notes due February 1, 2015 (the "Notes") in connection with the KinderCare acquisition and related financing transactions.

Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion The table below shows KLC PropCo pro forma historical results for 2005 assuming the division of KLC OpCo and KLC PropCo in the series of transactions completed in November 2005 (the "Real Estate Transactions") and related financing, together with the lease of KLC PropCo-owned centers to KLC OpCo, occurred on January 1, 2004. Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC PropCo's ability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty and actual performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in "Risk Factors," particularly the risk factor related to projected financial statements, elsewhere in this Memorandum.
