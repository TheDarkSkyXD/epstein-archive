STOCKS TO WATCH

Electric automaker Tesla Motors (TSLA) has received almost 400,000 preorders for its Model 3 sedan, just weeks after the cheaper vehicle with a starting price of $35,000 was unveiled. United Continental (UAL) reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.23 per share, 5 cents above estimates, while the airline's revenue was in line with forecasts. Guidance for the current quarter was downbeat, as passenger revenue miles are set to decline up to 8.5 percent on soft bookings. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) missed estimates by 18 cents with adjusted quarterly earnings of 45 cents per share, and the casino operator's revenue was also below forecasts. The company's results were hurt by weaker Las Vegas results as well as the ongoing downturn in Macau.
Mattel (MAT) lost an adjusted 13 cents per share for its latest quarter, 6 cents wider than estimates, although revenue was above forecasts. The toymaker has been hit by a sales slump in its iconic Barbie line as well as other brands.Qualcomm (QCOM) came in 8 cents above estimates, reporting an adjusted $1.04 per share profit. Revenue was above estimates, but its current quarter earnings guidance was not. The chipmaker said it would recognize more than $200 million in revenue for the current quarter following the resolution of a patent dispute with LG Electronics. Citrix Systems (CTXS) trounced forecasts by 26 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.18 per share, and revenue was well above estimates as well. The business software maker also raised its full-year 2016 guidance.The
 company is benefiting from both cost cuts and improved software sales. Struggling Japanese electronics giant Sony (SNE) cut its profit estimate by 9.4 percent for the fiscal year that ended in March, as slowing global smartphone sales dented demand for its camera modules. WATERCOOLER
