I. BACKGROUND 
A. Jeffrey Epstein’s Conviction and the CVRA Suit 


The origins of this case lie in a decade-old criminal proceeding 
against financier Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). On June 30, 2008, Epstein 
pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting, and procuring a 
person under the age of eighteen for, prostitution. The charges 
stemmed from sexual activity with privately hired “masseuses,” some 
of whom were under eighteen, Florida’s age of consent. Pursuant to 
an agreement with state and federal prosecutors, Epstein pleaded to 
the state charges. He received limited jail-time, registered as a sex 
offender, and agreed to pay compensation to his victims. In return, 


prosecutors declined to bring federal charges. 


Shortly after Epstein entered his plea, two of his victims, 
proceeding as “Jane Doe 1” and “Jane Doe 2,” filed suit against the 
Government in the Southern District of Florida under the Crime 


Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”). The victims sought to nullify the plea 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page6 of 25 


agreement, alleging that the Government failed to fulfill its legal 
obligations to inform and consult with them in the process leading up 


to Epstein’s plea deal. 


On December 30, 2014, two additional unnamed victims—one 
of whom has now self-identified as Plaintiff-Appellee Virginia Giuffre 
(“Giuffre”)— petitioned to join in the CVRA case. These petitioners 
included in their filings not only descriptions of sexual abuse by 
Epstein, but also new allegations of sexual abuse by several other 
prominent individuals, “including numerous prominent American 
politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well- 
known Prime Minister, and other world leaders,” as well as 
Dershowitz (a long-time member of the Harvard Law School faculty 
who had worked on Epstein’s legal defense) and Defendant-Appellee 
Ghislaine Maxwell (“Maxwell”).? 


Dershowitz moved to intervene, seeking to “strike the 
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and to 
request a show cause order to the attorneys that have made them.” 


“l 


Exercising its authority to “strike from a pleading an insufficient 





1 On February 21, 2019, the Florida District Court ruled that federal 
prosecutors had violated the CVRA by failing to adequately notify the two victims- 
plaintiffs of the plea deal. The District Court has not yet determined the appropriate 
remedy. See Doe 1 v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1204-17 (S.D. Fla. 2019). 


2 Doe 1 v. United States, No. 08-CV-80736-KAM, 2015 WL 11254692, at *2 (S.D. 
Fla. Apr. 7, 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).

defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous 
matter... on its own,” the Florida District Court (Kenneth A. Marra, 
Judge) sua sponte struck all allegations against additional parties from 
the pleadings, including those against Dershowitz, and therefore 


denied Dershowitz’s motion as moot.> 


The stricken allegations, however, quickly found their way into 
the press, and several media outlets published articles repeating 
Giuffre’s accusations. In response to the allegations, on January 3, 
2015, Maxwell’s publicist issued a press statement declaring that 
Giuffre’s allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue” and that 


her “claims are obvious lies.’”’”® 
B. Giuffre Sues Maxwell 


On September 21, 2015, Giuffre filed the underlying action 
against Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. Giuffre alleged 
that Maxwell had defamed her through this and other public 
statements. Extensive and hard-fought discovery followed. Due to the 
volume of sealing requests filed during discovery, on August 9, 2016, 
the District Court entered a Sealing Order that effectively ceded 
control of the sealing process to the parties themselves. The Sealing 
Order disposed of the requirement that the parties file individual letter 


briefs to request sealing and prospectively granted all of the parties’

future sealing requests. In total, 167 documents—nearly one-fifth of 
the docket— were filed under seal. These sealed documents include, 
inter alia, motions to compel discovery, motions for sanctions and 


adverse inferences, motions in limine, and similar material. 


On January 6, 2017, Maxwell filed a motion for summary 
judgment. The parties submitted their memoranda of law and 
supporting exhibits contesting this motion under seal. On March 22, 
2017, the District Court denied the motion in a heavily redacted 76- 
page opinion. Once again, the entire summary judgment record, 
including the unredacted version of the District Court opinion 
denying summary judgment, remained under seal. On May 24, 2017, 
Maxwell and Giuffre executed a settlement agreement, and the case 


was closed the next day. 
C. Motions to Intervene and Unseal 


Over the course of the litigation before Judge Sweet, three 
outside parties attempted to unseal some or all of the sealed material. 
On August 11, 2016, Dershowitz moved to intervene, seeking to unseal 
three documents that, he argues, demonstrate that Giuffre invented 
the accusations against him. On January 19, 2017, Cernovich, an 
independent blogger and _ self-described “popular _ political 
journalist,””? moved to intervene, seeking to unseal the summary 
judgment record, and Dershowitz joined his motion. On April 6, 2018, 


after the case had settled, the Herald moved to intervene and unseal 


7 Br. Appellant (Cernovich) 4. 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page9 of 25 


the entire docket. The District Court granted each of these motions to 
intervene, but denied the related requests to unseal in orders entered 
November 2, 2016, May 3, 2017, and August 27, 2018, respectively. 


The Appellants timely appealed from each of the orders 
denying their respective motions to unseal. Although each Appellant 
seeks the release of a different set of documents, all argue that the 
District Court failed to analyze the documents individually or 
properly apply the presumption of public access to court documents. 
We therefore ordered that the appeals be heard in tandem and held 
argument on March 6, 2019. 


On March 11, 2019, we issued an order to show cause why we 
“should not unseal the summary judgment motion, including any 
materials filed in connection with this motion, and the District Court’s 
summary judgment decision.”® The parties timely filed their 


responses. 
II. DISCUSSION 


There are two categories of sealed material at issue in these 
appeals: (1) the summary judgment record, which includes the parties’ 
summary judgment briefs, their statements of undisputed facts, and 
incorporated exhibits; and (2) court filings made in the course of the 
discovery process and with respect to motions in limine. In this 


Opinion, we explain that our law requires the unsealing of the 


8 Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 18-2868-cv, Docket No. 138. 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page10 of 25 


summary judgment materials and individualized review of the 


remaining sealed materials. 


While the law governing public access to these materials is 
largely settled, we have not yet adequately addressed the potential 
harms that often accompany such access. These harms are apparent. 
Over forty years ago, the Supreme Court observed that, without 
vigilance, courts’ files might “become a vehicle for improper 
purposes.”° Our legal process is already susceptible to abuse. 
Unscrupulous litigants can weaponize the discovery process to 
humiliate and embarrass their adversaries. Shielded by the “litigation 
privilege,” bad actors can defame opponents in court pleadings or 
depositions without fear of lawsuit and liability. Unfortunately, the 
presumption of public access to court documents has the potential to 
exacerbate these harms to privacy and reputation by ensuring that 


damaging material irrevocably enters the public record. 


We therefore take the opportunity to describe the tools available 
to district courts in protecting the integrity of the judicial process, and 
emphasize the courts’ responsibility to exercise these powerful tools. 
We also caution the public to critically assess allegations contained in 


judicial pleadings.

A. Standard of Review 


When reviewing a district court’s decision to seal a filing or 
maintain such a seal, “we examine the court’s factual findings for clear 
error, its legal determinations de novo, and its ultimate decision to seal 


or unseal for abuse of discretion.” !! 
B. The Summary Judgment Materials 


With respect to the first category of materials, it is well-settled 
that “documents submitted to a court for its consideration in a 
summary judgment motion are—as a matter of law—judicial 
documents to which a strong presumption of access attaches, under 
both the common law and the First Amendment.” In light of this 
strong First Amendment presumption, “continued sealing of the 
documents may be justified only with specific, on-the-record findings 
that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the 


sealing order is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim.” 


"| Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139 
(2d Cir. 2016). 


 Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir. 2006). We 
observe that our holding in Lugosch relies on the general principle that parties may 
“be assumed to have supported their papers with admissible evidence and non- 
frivolous arguments.” Id. at 122. Insofar as a district court has, through striking a 
filing, specifically found that assumption inapplicable, the categorical rule in 
Lugosch may not apply. See notes 42-43 and accompanying text, post. 


3 Td. at 124. Examples of such countervailing values may include, 
depending on the circumstances, preserving “the right of an accused to 
fundamental fairness in the jury selection process,” Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court 


11 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page12 of 25 


In this case, the District Court erred in several respects." First, it 
failed to give proper weight to the presumption of access that attaches 
to documents filed in connection with summary judgment motions. 
The District Court reasoned that the summary judgment materials 
were “entitled to a lesser presumption of access” because “summary 
judgment was denied by the Court.” In assigning a “lesser 
presumption” to such materials, the District Court relied on a single 
sentence of dicta from our decision in United States v. Amodeo.'* We 
have since clarified, however, that this sentence was based on a 
“quotation from a partial concurrence and partial dissent in the D.C. 
Circuit... [and] is thus not the considered decision of either this court 
or the D.C. Circuit.”’”7 In fact, we have expressly rejected the 


proposition that “different types of documents might receive different 





of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984); the protection of attorney-client 
privilege, Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 125; “the danger of impairing law enforcement or 
judicial efficiency,” SEC. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232 (2d Cir. 2001); and “the 
privacy interest of those who resist disclosure,” id. 


“4 Our discussion here focuses specifically on the District Court’s denial of 
the Herald’s motion to unseal the entire record. Because this decision grants relief 
to all Appellants, we need not discuss any separate, additional error in the District 
Court’s denial of the earlier motions to unseal.

1671 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Amodeo II”) (“One judge [in the District 
of Columbia Circuit] has pointed out, for example, that where a district court 
denied the summary judgment motion, essentially postponing a final determination 
of substantive legal rights, the public interest in access is not as pressing.” (internal 
quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original)).

weights of presumption based on the extent to which they were relied 


upon in resolving [a] motion [for summary judgment].”18 


Second, in contravention of our precedent, the District Court 
failed to review the documents individually and produce “specific, on- 
the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher 
values.”!9 Instead, the District Court made generalized statements 


about the record as a whole.”° This too was legal error. 


Finally, upon reviewing the summary judgment materials in 
connection with this appeal, we find that there is no countervailing 
privacy interest sufficient to justify their continued sealing. Remand 
with respect to these documents is thus unnecessary. Accordingly, and 
to avoid any further delay,*! we order that the summary judgment 
documents (with minimal redactions) be unsealed upon issuance of 


our mandate.”2

that those allegations “establish[] a strong privacy interest here”). 


21 Cf. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 127 (ordering that “the mandate shall issue 
forthwith” to expedite the unsealing process).

C. The Remaining Sealed Materials 


The law governing disclosure of the remaining sealed material 
in this case is only slightly more complex. The Supreme Court has 
recognized a qualified right “to inspect and copy judicial records and 
documents.” In defining “judicial records and documents,” we have 
emphasized that “the mere filing of a paper or document with the 
court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial document subject to 
the right of public access.”*4 Instead, “the item filed must be relevant 
to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 


process in order for it to be designated a judicial document.” 


As our precedent makes clear, a court “perform[s] the judicial 
function” not only when it rules on motions currently before it, but 


also when properly exercising its inherent “supervisory powers.”?° A 


security numbers. We have also redacted the names of alleged minor victims of 
sexual abuse from deposition testimony and police reports, as well as deposition 
responses concerning intimate matters where the questions were likely only 
permitted—and the responses only compelled —because of a strong expectation of 
continued confidentiality. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2. While we appreciate the views 
expressed in Judge Pooler’s separate opinion, the panel majority believes that the 
efforts invested by three former district judges in reviewing these materials 
adequately address those concerns.

(explaining that, in considering whether the report of a monitor charged with 
assessing compliance with a deferred prosecution agreement is a judicial 


14 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page15 of 25 


document is thus “relevant to the performance of the judicial function” 
if it would reasonably have the tendency to influence a district court’s 
ruling on a motion or in the exercise of its supervisory powers, without 
regard to which way the court ultimately rules or whether the 
document ultimately in fact influences the court’s decision.” 
Accordingly, if in applying these standards, a court determines that 
documents filed by a party are not relevant to the performance of a 


judicial function, no presumption of public access attaches.?8 


Once an item is deemed relevant to the exercise of judicial 
power, “the weight to be given the presumption of access must be 
governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of Article 


III judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those 


document, “[i]f the district court’s conception of its supervisory power in this 
context were correct, the Monitor’s Report would quite obviously be relevant to the 
performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process” (internal 
quotation marks omitted)). Whether a specific judicial decision constitutes a 
“performance of the judicial function” is a question of law. Accordingly, we review 
such determinations de novo. Id. at 134. 


27 Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145-46 (concluding that documents were relevant to 
the performance of a judicial function because they would have “informed” the 
district court’s decision whether to discharge or retain a Receiver); see also FTC. v. 
Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 409 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing Federal Rule of 
Evidence 401’s “having any tendency” definition of relevance in determining 
whether documents were “judicial documents”). 


*8 As we explain below, there are several (often preferable) tools beyond 
sealing that district courts can use to protect their dockets from becoming a vehicle 
for irrelevant—and potentially defamatory —accusations. See Section D, post. 


15 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page16 of 25 


monitoring the federal courts.””? Thus, while evidence introduced at 
trial or in connection with summary judgment enjoys a strong 
presumption of public access, documents that “play only a negligible 
role in the performance of Article III duties” are accorded only a low 
presumption that “amounts to little more than a prediction of public 
access absent a countervailing reason.”°° Documents that are never 
filed with the court, but simply “passed between the parties in 


discovery, lie entirely beyond the presumption’s reach.”>! 


The remaining sealed materials at issue here include filings 
related to, inter alia, motions to compel testimony, to quash trial 
subpoenae, and to exclude certain deposition testimony. All such 
motions, at least on their face, call upon the court to exercise its Article 
III powers. Moreover, erroneous judicial decision-making with respect 
to such evidentiary and discovery matters can cause substantial harm. 
Such materials are therefore of value “to those monitoring the federal 
courts.”°2 Thus, all documents submitted in connection with, and 
relevant to, such judicial decision-making are subject to at least some 


presumption of public access.*

30 Td. at 1050. 

31 Td. 

32 Id. at 1049. 


3 In previous decisions, we have identified an important exception to this 
general rule: the presumption of public access does not apply to material that is 
submitted to the court solely so that the court may decide whether that same 


16 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page17 of 25 


Although a court’s authority to oversee discovery and control 
the evidence introduced at trial surely constitutes an exercise of 
judicial power, we note that this authority is ancillary to the court’s 
core role in adjudicating a case. Accordingly, the presumption of 
public access in filings submitted in connection with discovery 
disputes or motions in limine is generally somewhat lower than the 
presumption applied to material introduced at trial, or in connection 
with dispositive motions such as motions for dismissal or summary 
judgment.** Thus, while a court must still articulate specific and 
substantial reasons for sealing such material, the reasons usually need 
not be as compelling as those required to seal summary judgment 


filings. 


Here, the precise basis for the District Court’s decision to deny 
the motion to unseal these remaining materials is unclear. In the three 
paragraphs devoted to the issue, the District Court emphasized the 
potential for embarrassment “given the highly sensitive nature of the 
underlying allegations,” and concluded that “the documents sealed in 
the course of discovery were neither relied upon by [the District] Court 
in the rendering of an adjudication, nor necessary to or helpful in 
resolving a motion.”* It is therefore unclear whether the District Court 


held that these materials were not judicial documents (and thus are 





material must be disclosed in the discovery process or shielded by a Protective 
Order. See TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233.

not subject to a presumption of public access), or found that privacy 


interests outweighed a limited right of public access. 


On either interpretation, however, the District Court’s holding 
was error. Insofar as the District Court held that these materials are not 
judicial documents because it did not rely on them in adjudicating a 
motion, this was legal error. As explained above, the proper inquiry is 
whether the documents are relevant to the performance of the judicial 
function, not whether they were relied upon.** Indeed, decision- 
makers often find that a great deal of relevant material does not 
ultimately sway their decision. And insofar as the District Court held 
that privacy interests outweigh the presumption of public access in 
each of the thousands of pages at issue, that decision— which appears 
to have been made without particularized review—amounts to an 


abuse of discretion.°” 


In light of the District Court’s failure to conduct an 
individualized review of the sealed materials, it is necessary to do so 
now. We believe the District Court is best situated to conduct this 
review. The District Court can directly communicate with the parties, 
and can therefore more swiftly and thoroughly consider particular 
objections to unsealing specific materials. Relatedly, the District Court 
can obtain the parties’ assistance in effecting any necessary redactions, 


and in notifying any outside parties whose privacy interests might be

implicated by the unsealing. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the 
District Court to conduct such a particularized review and unseal all 
documents for which the presumption of public access outweighs any 


countervailing privacy interests. 
D. Protecting the Integrity of Judicial Proceedings 


While we disagree with the District Court’s disposition of the 
motions to unseal, we share its concern that court files might be used 
to “promote scandal arising out of unproven potentially libelous 
statements.”°° We therefore describe certain methods courts can 
employ to protect the judicial process from being coopted for such 


purposes. 


The Supreme Court has explained that “[e]very court has 
supervisory power over its own records and files” to ensure they “are 
not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal” or “serve 
as reservoirs of libelous statements for press consumption.”%? This 
supervisory function is not only within a district court’s power, but 


also among its responsibilities. 


In practice, district courts may employ several methods to fulfill 
this function. They may, for instance, issue protective orders 
forbidding dissemination of certain material “to protect a party or 


person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue

burden” and require that filings containing such material be submitted 
under seal.*° If parties then seek to file such materials, the court may 
deny them leave to do so.*! District courts may also seek to counteract 
the effect of defamatory statements by explaining on the record that 
the statements appear to lack credibility. Moreover, under Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), the district court may strike such 
material from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, 
immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous.”4? Because such rejected or 
stricken material is not “relevant to the performance of the judicial 
function” it would not be considered a “judicial document” and would 


enjoy no presumption of public access.* Finally, in appropriate

“on its own” or “on motion made by a party.” Id. Although motions to strike 
material solely “on the ground that the matter is impertinent and immaterial” are 
disfavored, when material is also “scandalous,” no such presumption applies. Cf.

circumstances, district courts may impose sanctions on attorneys and 


parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c).4 
E. A Cautionary Note 


We conclude with a note of caution to the public regarding the 


reliability of court filings such as those unsealed today. 


Materials submitted by parties to a court should be understood 
for what they are. They do not reflect the court’s own findings. Rather, 
they are prepared by parties seeking to advance their own interests in 
an adversarial process. Although affidavits and depositions are 


J 


offered “under penalty of perjury,” it is in fact exceedingly rare for 


anyone to be prosecuted for perjury in a civil proceeding. Similarly, 





“4 Tn relevant part, Rule 11 provides: 


By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper... an 
attorney or unrepresented party certifies that .. . it is not being presented 
for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or 
needlessly increase the cost of litigation ... . [T]he court may impose an 
appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the 
rule or is responsible for the violation . . . . The sanction may include 
nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed 
on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing 
payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney’s fees and 
other expenses directly resulting from the violation. 


Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. See also Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1049 (describing sanctions available 
to the court).

Politics: A Modern Approach, 30 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 35, 47 n.52 (1996) ("Perjury cases

pleadings, complaints, and briefs—while supposedly based on 
underlying evidentiary material—can be misleading. Such documents 
sometimes draw dubious inferences from already questionable 


material or present ambiguous material as definitive. 


Moreover, court filings are, in some respects, particularly 
susceptible to fraud. For while the threat of defamation actions may 
deter malicious falsehoods in standard publications, this threat is non- 
existent with respect to certain court filings. This is so because, under 
New York law (which governs the underlying defamation claim here), 
“absolute immunity from liability for defamation exists for oral or 
written statements made... . in connection with a proceeding before a 
court.” 4¢ Thus, although the act of filing a document with a court might 
be thought to lend that document additional credibility, in fact, 
allegations appearing in such documents might be less credible than 


those published elsewhere.” 


46 Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 718 (2015); see also Kelly v. Albarino, 485 
F.3d 664, 666 (2d Cir. 2007) (adopting the reasoning of the District Court explaining 
that this privilege is “the broadest of possible privileges”); Restatement (Second) of 
Torts § 587 (1977) (“A party to a private litigation or a private prosecutor or 
defendant in a criminal prosecution is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory 
matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial 
proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course and as a part of, a judicial 
proceeding in which he participates, if the matter has some relation to the 
proceeding.”). But see note 47, post. 


47 While common law courts have generally interpreted the litigation privilege 
broadly, they nevertheless maintain an important (if rarely implemented) 
limitation on its scope: to qualify for the privilege, a statement must be “material 
and pertinent to the questions involved.” Front, 24 N.Y.3d at 718 (quoting Youmans

We have long noted that the press plays a vital role in ensuring 
the public right of access and in enhancing “the quality and safeguards 
the integrity of the factfinding process.”4* When faithfully observing 
its best traditions, the print and electronic media “contributes to public 
understanding of the rule of law” and “validates [its] claim of 


functioning as surrogates for the public.” 


At the same time, the media does the public a profound 
disservice when it reports on parties’ allegations uncritically. We have 
previously observed that courts cannot possibly “discredit every 
statement or document turned up in the course of litigation,” and we 
have criticized “the use by the media of the somewhat misleading term 


‘court records’ in referring to such items.”°° Even ordinarily critical 


v. Smith, 153 N.Y. 214, 219-20 (1897)). It follows, then, that immaterial and 
impertinent statements are (at least nominally) actionable, particularly when they 
are “so needlessly defamatory as to warrant the inference of express malice.” Id. 
(same). It seems to us that when a district court strikes statements from the record 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) on the ground that the matter is “impertinent” and 
“immaterial,” it makes the very same determination that permits a defamation 
action under the common law. We think the judicial system would be well served 
were our common law courts to revitalize this crucial qualification to the litigation 
privilege.

readers may take the reference to “court papers” as some sort of 


marker of reliability. This would be a mistake. 


We therefore urge the media to exercise restraint in covering 
potentially defamatory allegations, and we caution the public to read 


such accounts with discernment. 
III. CONCLUSION 
To summarize, we hold as follows: 


(1) Materials submitted in connection with a motion for 
summary judgment are subject to a strong presumption of 


public access. 


(2) The summary judgment record at issue will be unsealed 
upon issuance of our mandate, subject to minimal 


redactions.*! 


(3) Materials submitted in connection with, and relevant to, 
discovery motions, motions in limine, and other non- 
dispositive motions are subject to a lesser—but still 


substantial— presumption of public access. 


(4) The District Court is directed to review the remaining sealed 
materials individually and unseal those materials as 


appropriate. 


51 See note 22, ante. 


24 


Case 18-2868, Document 213-1, 07/03/2019, 2600261, Page25 of 25 


(5) District courts should exercise the full range of their 
substantial powers to ensure their files do not become 


vehicles for defamation. 


For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the orders of the 
District Court entered on November 2, 2016, May 3, 2017, and August 
27, 2018, ORDER the unsealing of the summary judgment record as 
described herein, and REMAND the cause to the District Court for 


particularized review of the remaining materials. 


In undertaking this task, the District Court may be well-served 
by ordering the parties to submit to the Court unredacted, electronic 
copies of the remaining sealed materials, as well as specific, proposed 
redactions. The District Court may also order the parties to identify 
and notify additional parties whose privacy interests would likely be 


implicated by disclosure of these materials. 


In the interests of judicial economy, any future appeal in this 


matter shall be referred to this panel.
