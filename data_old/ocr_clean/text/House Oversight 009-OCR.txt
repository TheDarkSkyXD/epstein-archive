headlong advances? We're getting more vulnerable. Our increasingly interconnected world depends on elaborate networks: electric-power grids, air traffic control, international finance, globally-dispersed manufacturing, and so forth. Unless these networks are highly resilient, their benefits could be outweighed by catastrophic (albeit rare) breakdowns. Our cities would be paralysed without electricity. Air travel can spread a pandemic worldwide within days. And social media can spread panic and rumour, and economic contagion, literally at the speed of light. The smartphone, the web and their ancillaries are already crucial to our networked lives. But they would have seemed magic even 20 years ago. So, looking several decades ahead we must keep our minds open, or at least ajar, to transformative advances that may now seem science fiction. There've been exciting advances in what's called generalized machine learning - Deep Mind (a small London company now bought up by Google) last year achieved a remarkable feat -- its computer beat the world champion in the game of 'Go'. And Carnegie-Mellon University has developed a machine that can bluff and calculate as well as the best human players of poker. It's 20 years since IBM's 'Deep Blue' beat Kasparov, the world chess champion. But Deep Blue was programmed in detail by expert players. In contrast, the machines that play Go and Poker gained expertise by absorbing huge numbers of games and playing against themselves. Their designers don't themselves know how the machines make seemingly insightful decisions. But advances are patchy. Robots are still clumsier than a child in moving pieces on a real chessboard. They can't tie your shoelaces or cut ole people's toenails. . But sensor technology, speech recognition, information searches and so forth are advancing apace. But it's in deep space -- Carl Sagan's special arena - that robots will surely be transformative. During this century the whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturized probes - far more advanced than the robot that ESA's Rosetta landed on a comet, or NASA's 'New Horizons' probe that transmitted amazing pictures from Pluto, 10,000 times further away than the moon. These two instruments took ten years on their journeys. And the amazing Cassini probe of Saturn is even more of an antique - it was launched more than20 years ago. Think how much better we could do today. And better, too than the 'Curiosity' rover on Mars HOUSE. _OVERSIGHT_026737

"SURVIVING THE CENTURY The inaugural Carl Sagan Memorial Lecture Cornell University, 8 May 2017 It's a great honour to give this Carl Sagan lecture. The ideas he stood for need proclaiming louder than ever today. We need an optimistic vision of life's destiny - in this world, and perhaps far beyond it. We need to think globally, we need to think rationally, we need to think long-term. Carl's influence was immense, through his science and - most of all, through his eloquence and global outreach. In this talk I'll try to address some themes that would have engaged him.. We've been familiar with this image [Earthrise] for nearly 50 years -it's iconic for environmentalists.. But suppose some hypothetical aliens had been watching the Earth for its entire history, what would they have seen? Over nearly all that immense time, 4.5 billion years, things would have changed very gradually. The continents drifted; the ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved and became extinct. But in just a tiny sliver of Earth's history - the last one millionth part, a few thousand years - the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signalled the start of agriculture. Changes in land-use accelerated as human populations rose. Then came even faster changes. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to rise anomalously fast. The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves. And something else unprecedented happened: small projectiles launched from the planet's surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some were propelled into orbits around the Earth; some journeyed to the Moon and planets. If they understood astrophysics, the aliens could confidently predict that our biosphere would face doom in a few billion years when the Sun flares up and dies. But could they have predicted this unprecedented runaway fever -- less than half way through the Earth's life? And what might they see if they watched for another century? Will this spasm be followed by silence? Or will stability ensue? And will more projectiles leave the Earth to establish oases of life elsewhere? These are the questions I'll speculate about Some years ago I wrote a book which I entitled 'Our Final Century ?' My publisher deleted the question-mark. The American publishers changed the title to 'Our Final HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026731

Hour'. (you Americans seek instant gratification - and the converse). Its theme was that this century is special: it's the first when one species, ours, has the planet's future in its hands. We're deep in an era that's called the anthropocene. We have huge powers for good. We could trigger the transition from biological to electronic intelligences. But, on the other hand, we could irreversibly degrade the biosphere, And advanced technology, if misdirected, could cause a devastating setback to civilization. We've had one lucky escape already. At any time in the Cold War era - when armament levels escalated beyond all reason -- the superpowers could have stumbled towards armageddon through muddle and miscalculation. The threat is only in abeyance and still looms over us. Nuclear weapons are based on 20"h century science. I'll focus later in my talk on 21st century sciences - bio, cyber, and AI - which offer huge potential benefits but also expose us to novel vulnerabilities Astronomers often have to remind people that they're not astrologers. Like all scientists they hava a rotten record as forecasters - almost as bad as economists. But even with a cloudy crystal ball there are some things we can predict about how our whole planet will change. For instance, humanity's collective footprint is getting heavier, Fifty years ago, world population was about 3 billion. It now exceeds 7 billion. The growth's been mainly in Asia and Africa, as shown in this map where regions are scaled in proportion to that growth. The number of births per year, worldwide, peaked a few years ago and is going down, Nonetheless world population is forecast to rise to around 9 billion by 2050. That's partly because most people in the developing world are young. They are yet to have children, and they will live longer. The age histogram in the developing world will become more like it is in Europe. The main growth is in East Asia, and it's there that the world's human and financial resources will become concentrated —ending 4 centuries of North Atlantic hegemony. HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_026732

And there's more urbanization. Even by 2030 Lagos, San Paulo and Delhi will have populations above 30 million. To prevent megacities becoming turbulent dystopias will surely be a major challenge to governance. Population growth seems currently under-discussed. That is maybe because doom- laden forecasts in the 1970s, by the Club of Rome, Paul Erlich and others, have proved off the mark. Up till now, food production has more than kept pace - famines stem from wars or mal-distribution, not overall shortage. And it's deemed by some a taboo subject - tainted by association with eugenics in the 1920s and 30s, with Indian policies under Indira Gandhi, and more recently with China's hard-line one-child policy. Can the Earth 'carry' 9 billion people? There seems no need for gloom or panic on this front... Improved agriculture - low-till, water-conserving, and perhaps involving GM crops could feed that number by mid-century. The buzz-phrase is ' sustainable intensification'. But lifestyle changes are needed. The world couldn't sustain even its present population if everyone lived like Americans do today- using as much energy and eating as much beef. Population trends beyond 2050 are harder to predict. They will depend on what people as yet unborn decide about the number and spacing of their children. Enhanced education and empowerment of women -- surely a benign priority in itself -- reduces fertility rates. But the demographic transition hasn't reached parts of India and Sub-Saharan Africa. If families in Africa remain large,, then according to the UN that continent's population could double again by 2100, to 4 billion, thereby raising the global population to 11 billion. Nigeria alone would by then have as big a population as Europe and North America combined, and almost half of all the world's children would be in Africa. Optimists remind us that each extra mouth brings also two hands and a brain. Nonetheless the higher the population becomes, the greater will be all pressures on resources, especially if the developing world narrows its gap with the developed world in its per capita consumption. So we must surely hope that the global figure declines rather than rises after 2050. Moreover, if humanity's collective impact on nature pushes too hard against what Johan Rockstrom calls 'planetary boundaries', the resultant 'ecological shock' could HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_026733

irreversibly impoverish our biosphere. Extinction rates are rising - we're destroying the book of life before we've read it. Biodiversity is a crucial component of long-term human wellbeing. We're clearly harmed if fish stocks dwindle to extinction; there are plants in the rain forest whose gene pool might be useful to us. But for many environmentalists, preserving the richness of our biosphere has value in its own right, over and above what it means to us humans To quote the great ecologist E O Wilson 'mass extinction is the sin that future generations will least forgive us for'. CLIMATE CHANGE So the world's getting more crowded. And there's a second firm prediction: it will gradually get warmer. In contract to population issues, climate change is certainly not under-discussed - though it is under-acted-upon The famous Keeling curve shows how the concentration of CO2 in the air is rising, mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels. The fifth IPCC report presented temperature- projections, for different assumptions about future rates of fossil fuel use. For each such assumption there's a spread bevause it remains unclear how much the climatic effects of CO2 are amplified by associated changes in water vapour and clouds - the so-called sensitivity factor. IPCC PROJECTIONS But despite these uncertainties the science tells is that under 'business as usual' scenarios we can't rule out, by 2100, really catastrophic warming, and tipping points triggering long-term trends like the melting of Greenland's icecap. Sadly, many deny this. But even among those who accept that this threat is real, there is a range of views. These stem from differences in economics and ethics -- in particular, in how much obligation we should feel towards future generations. Bjorn Lomberg's Copenhagen Consensus, for instance applies commercial-style discounting - and in effect writes off what happens beyond 2050. So, unsurprisingly he downplays the priority of addressing climate change in comparison with shorter- term efforts to help the world's poor. But if you care about those who'll live into the 22 century and beyond, then, as economists like Stern and Weizman argue, you deem it worth paying an insurance premium now, to protect those generations against the worst-case scenarios. Above all, it depends on an ethical issue - in optimizing people's life-chances, should we discriminate on grounds of date of birth? HOUSE. _OVERSIGHT_026734

(As a parenthesis, I'd note one policy context when an essentially zero discount rate is applied - radioactive waste disposal, where the depositories are required to prevent leakage for 10000 years - somewhat ironic when we can't plan the rest of energy policy even 30 years ahead) [Consider this analogy. Suppose astronomers had tracked an asteroid, and calculated that it would hit the Earth in 2080, 65 years from now - not with certainty, but with (say) 10 percent probability. Would we relax, saying that it's a problem that can be set on one side for 50 years - people will then be richer, and it may turn out then that it's going to miss the Earth anyway? I don't think we would. There would surely be a consensus that we should start straight away and do our damnedest to find ways to deflect it, or mitigate its ettects.] Many still hope that our civilisation can segue smoothly towards a low-carbon future The pledges made at the Paris conference are a positive step. But even if they're honoured, this may not happen fast enough to prevent CO2 concentrations rising to dangerous levels. Politicians seldom take a long-term view, and won't gain much resonance by advocating unwelcome lifestyle changes now - when the benefits accrue mainly to distant parts of the world, and are decades into the future. But there's one measures to mitigate climate change that genuinely seems a 'win win' scenario. CLEANER ENERGY SOURCES It's that nations should accelerate R and D into all forms of low-carbon energy generation (renewables,, 4'th generation nuclear, fusion, and the rest). And into other technologies where parallel progress is crucial - especially storage (batteries, compressed air, pumped storage, flywheels, etc) and smart grids. That' why an encouraging outcome of Paris was an initiative called 'Mission Innovation'. It was launched by President Obama and by the Indian Prime Minister Modi. And endorsed by 20 other nations. It's a campaign to double publicly funded R and D into clean energy by 2020. There's been a parallel pledge by Bill Gates and other private philanthropists. This target is a modest one. Presently, only 2 percent of publicly funded R and D is devoted to these challenges. Why shouldn't the percentage be comparable to spending on medical or defence research? The faster these 'clean' technologies advance, the sooner will their prices fall so they become affordable to developing countries - where more generating capacity will be needed -- where the health of the poorest billions is jeopardized by smoky stoves HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_026735

burning wood or dung - and where there would otherwise be pressure to build coal- fired power stations. RENEWABLES It would be hard to think of a more inspiring challenge for young engineers than devising clean energy systems for the world. But if this fails, and if it's clear, 20 years from now, that our climate seems heading irreversibly into dangerous territory, there may then be a pressure for 'panic measures' GEOENGINEERING - being fatalistic about continuing dependence on fossil fuels, but combating its effects by geoengineering. GEOENGINEERING (PICTURE) It's feasible, for instance, to inject enough aerosols into the stratosphere to cool the world's climate -- indeed what is scary is that this might be within the resources of a single nation, or even a single corporation. There could be unintended side-effects. Moreover, the warming would return with a vengeance if the countermeasures were ever discontinued; and other consequences of rising CO2 (especially the deleterious effects of ocean acidification) would be unchecked. Geoengineering would be a political nightmare: not all nations would want to adjust the thermostat the same way. Very elaborate climatic modelling would be needed in order to calculate the regional impacts of an artificial intervention. (The only beneficiaries would be lawyers. They'd have a bonanza if nations could litigate over bad weather!). It may be prudent to explore geoengineering techniques enough to clarify which options make sense, and perhaps damp down undue optimism about a technical 'quick fix' of our climate. EARTH I think we should be evangelists for new technologies - without them the world can't provide food, and sustainable energy, for an expanding and more demanding population. But we need wisely-directed technology - advanced renewables are wise goals, geoengineering techniqoes probably aren't. But what about the other technologies that pervade our lives? Can we cope with their HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026736

Later this century giant robotic fabricators may assemble vast lightweight structures in space (gossamer-thin radio reflectors or solar energy collectors, for instance) - using raw materials mined from the Moon or asteroids. Robotic and AI advances are eroding the practical case for human spaceflight. Nonetheless, I hope people will follow the robots, though it will be as risk-seeking adventurers rather than for practical goals. The most promising developments are spearheaded by private companies. Elon Musk's Space X, has launched unmanned payloads and docked with the Space Station - and has successfully recovered and reuseed the launch-rocket's first stage - presaging real cost-saving. He hopes soon to offer orbital flights to paying customers. Wealthy adventurers are already signing up for a week-long trip round the far side of the Moon - voyaging further from Earth than anyone has been before I'm told they've sold a ticket for the second flight but not for the first flight. We should surely acclaim these private enterprise efforts in space - they can tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly-funded civilian astronauts, and thereby cut costs compared to NASA or ESA. But they should be promoted as adventures or extreme sports - the phrase 'space tourism' should be avoided. It lulls people into unrealistic confidence. By 2100 courageous pioneers in the mould of (say) Felix Baumgartner, who broke the sound barrier in free fall from a high-altitude balloon -- may have established 'bases' independent from the Earth - on Mars, or maybe on asteroids. Musk himself (aged 45) says he wants to die on Mars - but not on impact. But don't ever expect mass emigration from Earth. Nowhere in our Solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. It's a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth's problems. There's no 'Planet B'. Indeed, space is an inherently hostile environment for humans. For that reason, even though we may wish to regulate genetic and cyborg technology on Earth, we should surely wish the space pioneers good luck in using all such techniques to adapt to alien conditions. They'1l free from terrestrial regulation and have maximal incentive to do so. Indeed, these spacefarers may spearhead the post-human era - evolving within a few centuries into a new species HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_026738

Few doubt that machines will gradually surpass more and more of our distinctively human capabilities - or enhance them via cyborg technology. Disagreements are basically about the timescale - the rate of travel, not the direction of travel. The cautious amongst us envisage timescales of centuries rather than decades before humans are overtaken or transcended by electronic intelligence - far transcending the chemical and metabolic limits of 'wet' organic brains. These entities will then persist, continuing to evolve, for billions of years. Moreover, the timescales for technological advance are but an instant compared to the slow timescales of the Darwinian selection that led to humanity's emergence - and (more relevantly) they are less than a millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time lying ahead. But we humans shouldn't feel too humbled. Even though we are surely not the terminal branch of an evolutionary tree, we could be of special cosmic significance for jump-starting the transition to inorganic (and potentially immortal) entities, spreading their influence far beyond the Earth, and far transcending our limitations. Moreover, a planetary environment may suit us 'organics' - but interplanetary and interstellar space may be the preferred arena where robotic fabricators will have the grandest scope for construction, and where non-biological 'brains' may develop powers than humans can't even imagine. And they could spread through the cosmos - interstellar travel isn't daunting to near- immortal beings. Is there life out there already? Or is the Galaxy waiting for our progeny? We know there's nowhere in our solar system that harbours advanced life. However there may be freeze-dried bacteria on Mars. There may be creatures swimming under the Ice on Saturn's moon Enceladus. But let's widen our horizons to the realm of the stars. The prime subject-matter of the Carl Sagan Institute would have enthralled Carl. We've learnt that most stars in the sky are orbited by retinues of planets, like the Sun is . But the evidence is mainly indirect; we don't observe the planet, but detect its influence on the motion or brightness of the star it's orbiting The Carl Sagan Institute is specially interested in possible 'twins' of our Earth - planets the same size as ours, on orbits with temperatures such that water neither boils nor stays frozen. HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_026739

Some of these have been found - there are thought to be many millions in the Milky Way. There's one orbiting the nearest star, Proxima centauri And another nearby faint star has 7 Earth-sized planets around it Will there be life on them - maybe even intelligent life? The outer three are in the habitable zone They'd be spectacular places to live. Viewed fro the surface of one of the planets, the others would loom larger than our moon does to us - swinging past fast across the sky. But they're very un-Earthly. Probably tidally locked so that they present the same face to their star -one hemisphere in perpetual light. The other always dark. And the real goal, of course, is to see these exo-planets directly -- not just to infer them from their shadows . But that's hard. To realise just how hard, suppose an alien astronomer with a powerful telescope was viewing the Earth from (say) 30 light years away - the distance of a nearby star. Our planet would seem, in Carl's famous phrase, a 'pale blue dot', very close to a star (our Sun) that outshines it by many billions: a firefly next to a searchlight. The shade of blue would be slightly different, depending on whether the Pacific ocean or the Eurasian land mass was facing them. The alien astronomers could infer the length of our 'day', the seasons, the gross topography, and the climate. By analysing the faint light, they could infer that it had a biosphere. The James Webb space telescope may offer clues. But within 10 years, the European Southern Observatory, will hopefully have its ELT - with a mosaic mirror 39 metres across. Such instruments will be drawing inferences like this about exo-planets the size of our Earth. LIFE LIKELIHOOD Habitable doesn't mean inhabited - but for most of us that's the number-one question. We still don't know the likelihood - we know too little about how life began on Earth to lay confident odds. What triggered the transition from complex molecules to entities that can metabolise and reproduce? It might have involved a fluke so rare that it happened only once in the entire Galaxy. On the other hand, this crucial HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026740

transition might have been almost inevitable given the 'right' environment. We just don't know - nor do we know if the DNA/RNA chemistry of terrestrial life is the only possibility, or just one chemical basis among many options that could be realized elsewhere LIFE Moreover, even if simple life is widespread, we can't assess the odds that it evolves into a complex biosphere. And, even it did, it might anyway be unrecognizably different. And, by the way, it's too anthropocentric to limit attention to Earth-like planets. Carl Sagan and his Cornell colleague Ed Salpeter, envisaged balloon-like creatures floating in the dense atmospheres of Jupiter-like planets. We should also be mindful that seemingly artificial emissions could come from super-intelligent (though not necessarily conscious) computers, created by a race of alien beings that had already died out. Indeed I think that's the most likely option if evolution took a similar course to what may happen on Earth. If the emergence of technology on a planet lags significantly behind what has happened on Earth then that planet would plainly reveal no evidence of ET. But life around a star older than the Sun could have had a head-start of a billion years or more. Thus it may already have 'spawned' the futuristic scenario - trasitioning from organic to electronic -- that I envisaged as our Earth's post-human future. So even if SETI searches revealed some artificial emission, we'd be most unlikely to 'catch' alien intelligence in the brief sliver of time when it was still in organic form. I think it's less likely be a decodable message than to be a byproduct (or even a malfunction) of some super-complex interstellar technology that could trace its lineage back to alien organic beings (which might still exist on their home planet, or might long ago have died out). I won't hold my breath, but SETI programmes are a worthwhile gamble - because success in the search would carry the momentous message that concepts of logic and physics aren't limited to the hardware in human skulls. Even if intelligence were widespread in the cosmos, we may only ever recognise a small and atypical fraction of it. Moreover, the habit of referring to ET as an 'alien civilisation' may be too restrictive. A 'civilisation' connotes a society of individuals: in contrast, ET might be a single integrated intelligence HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026741

Perhaps the cosmos teems with life, even complex life; on the other hand, our Earth could be unique among the billions of planets that surely exist. That would be depressing for the searchers. But it would allow us to be less cosmically modest - Earth, though tiny, could be the most complex and interesting entity in the entire Galaxy - and its fate of cosmic and not merely terrestrial significance. . So let me conclude by focusing back closer to here and now. Even in the 'concertinered' timeline that astronomers envisage -- extending billions of years into the future, as well as into the past -- this century may be a defining era. The century when humans jump-start the transition to electronic (and potentially immortal) entities, that eventually spread their influence far beyond the Earth, and far transcend our limitations. Or -- to take a darker view - the century where our follies could foreclose the immense future potential. We fret unduly about small risks - air crashes. carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, etc. But I's argue that we're in denial about some newly emergent threats, which may seem improbable but whose consequences could be globally devastating. Some of these are environmental, others are the potential downsides of novel technologies. So how can those of us concerned about these issues - and inspired by Carl Sagan's long-term vision - influence policy-makers? The trouble is that even the best politicians focus mainly on the urgent and parochial - and getting re-elected. This is an endemic frustration for those who've been official scientific advisors in governments.. To attract politicians' attention you must get headlined in the press, and fill their in-boxes. So scientists can have more leverage indirectly -- by campaigning, so that the public and the media amplify their voice. Carl was of course ta preeminent exemplar of the concerned scientist - and had immense influence through his writings. broadcasts and lectures and campaigns.. And he was before the age of social media and tweets. He would have been a leader of the recent march for science - electrifying crowds through his passion and his eloquence. And of course the challenges are global. Coping with potential shortage of resources -- and transitioning to low carbon energy - can't be solved by each nation separately. Science is a universal culture, spanning all nations and faiths. So scientists confront fewer impediments on straddling political divides. Carl was himself close to the leaders of the Soviet space programme. The SETI initiative with Shklovski, and joint projects with Raoul Sagdeev. And the campaign to raise concern about nuclear winter. HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_026742

I think all scientists should, following his example, divert some of their efforts towards public policy - and engage with government, business, and NGOs We need a focus on projects that are long-term in political perspectives, even if a mere instant in the history of our planet. And that's something that universities can do - - not least because they're full of young people who will live to the end of the century. We should use their expertise to address the extreme low probability/high consequence' threats that I've mentioned - to assess which can be dismissed firmly as science fiction, and to consider how to enhance resilience against the more credible ones. But though we live under the shadow of these threats, and may be political pessimists, we must remain techno-optimists. Advances in AI, biotech, nanotech and space can boost the developing as well as the developed world. Indeed if we don't responsibly progress these new technologies we won't achieve a bright vision. Undiluted application of the 'precautionary principle' has a manifest downside. We're all on this crowded world together. "Space-ship Earth" is hurtling through the void. Its passengers are anxious and fractious. Their life-support system is vulnerable to disruption and break-downs. But there is too little planning too little horizon-scanning, too little awareness of long-term risks. A wise mantra is that 'the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable'. I want to conclude with some words from two scientific sages. First, HG Wells. Back in 1902. Wells was already alert to the risk of global disaster: "It is impossible to show why certain things should not utterly destroy and end the human story .. and make all our efforts vain.... something from space, or pestilence, or some great disease of the atmosphere, some trailing cometary poison, some great emanation of vapour from the interior of the Earth, or new animals to prey on us, or some drug or wrecking madness in the mind of man". But nonetheless he retained a vision. "Humanity", he proclaimed, "has come some way, and the distance we have travelled gives us some earnest of the way we have to go. All the past is but the beginning of a beginning; all that the human mind has accomplished is but the dream before the awakening." HOUSE _OVERSIGHT_026743

His rather purple prose still resonates more than a hundred years later. Were he writing today he would have been elated by our expanded vision of life and the cosmos - but he'd have been even more anxious about the perils we might face. He reflects the mix of optimism and anxiety - and of speculation and science - which I've tried to offer in this lecture. MEDAWAR But we mustn't leap from denial to despair. So I give the last word to another sage: the eloquent biologist Peter Medawar: "The bells that toll for mankind are ....... like the bells of Alpine cattle. They are attached to our own necks, and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound." HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026744

Private Donor Helps Fund Scientists After Trump's Proposed "Anti-Science" Budget Cuts 09/05/2017 05:48 pm ET • The famous American Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, once said, "The good thing about science is that it's true, whether or not you believe in it." Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote from The Colbert Report distinguishes the difference between opinion and fact. Science, as a base, is always true. Yet, it is interpretation that imparts human error. In other words, while science is a universal truth, not everyone believes in the importance of science. Consider President Trump's 2018 budget request. Many of these call for massive cuts in spending on scientific research, medical research, disease prevention programs and more. If these requests are met, the National Cancer Institute would face a $1 billion cut compared to its 2017 budget. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute could see a $575 million cut, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases would see a reduction of $838 million. The administration would cut the overall National Institutes of Health budget from $31.8 billion to $26 billion. The National Science Foundation, which gives $7 billion a year in grants to universities and research institutes, is not specifically mentioned in the budget. However, unspecified "other agencies" are in line for a 9.8 percent budget cut. Since Trump became president, the official White House website also deleted all mentions of climate from the site - all but one - the promise to eliminate the "harmful and unnecessary" Climate Action Plan. Following these actions, scientists and other employees of the EPA and USDA were told not to speak to the public about climate change or other scientific concerns that should be addressed Private Donations To Fund Science Due to Trump's anti-science policies and budget cuts, scientists are looking towards private donors for funding. Philanthropic dollars have now come to play an important role in scientific progress. The successful American financier and philanthropist, Jeffery Epstein, is well known for supporting science; he is currently taking action to help a number of scientists thrive during the "Trump Era." None of this is new for Jeffery, though. Jeffery's funding for science dates back to the year 2000, when he founded the Jeffery Epstein VI foundation to support cutting-edge science and science education around the world. The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation has supported many leading scientists including Stephen Hawkings, HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026755

Martin Nowak, Gregory Benford, Lee Smolin, Seth Lloyd, Lawrence Krauss, Artificial Intelligence scientist, Marvin Minsky and Nobel Laureates Gerard 't Hooft, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. In 2003, the Foundation established the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University, providing a $35 million gift to the university. The program is one of the first to study the evolution of molecular biology with the primary use of mathematics. It also became one of the first departments to develop a mathematical model to show how cancer cells evolve as infectious bacteria and viruses such as HIV. Lifeboat Foundation American Financier and Philanthropist, Jeffery Epstein Subscribe to The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news. Top of Form Bottom of Form Top of Form Bottom of Form While Jeffrey has donated large sums of money to help find a cure for cancer and infectious diseases, President Trump's proposed budget seeks an $82 million cut for the center that works on vaccine-preventable and respiratory diseases, such as influenza and measles. Trump's budget also proposes a cut of $186 million from programs at CDC's center on HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis prevention. One of the biggest cuts, however, is $222 million for the agency's chronic disease prevention programs, which are designed to help people prevent diabetes, heart disease and stroke, and obesity. "I have helped scientists for 20 years and I don't really believe that you can say you fully understand a particular problem, unless your ideas can be tested against solid evidence," Jeffery said. "But to tackle those problem you need resources, and if you have them the results can be marvellous. For example, in one simple and elegant equation, mathematics managed to describe the whole motion of the planets that alluded men for ages." A Helping Hand Goes A Long Way Private donors who help fund science-based research and projects, such as Jeffery, are making a huge difference. When federal dollars become tight, the donors who step in become the real heroes. And while private funds are not usually as large as federal funds, these donations can go a long way in terms of finding cures for diseases. For example, HIV/AIDS was once viewed as a death sentence in the 1980s, but years of privately-funded research have helped scientists understand the basic biology of viruses and the workings on DNA. The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, funded by Jeffery, is now conducting research in mapping colon cancer resistance to inhibitor drugs, mapping the progression of pancreatic cancer, targeting the topology of minority mutations that drive tumor growth and creating a database to predict and minimize resistance to HIV drugs. Robert Trivers is an evolutionary biologist and sociobiologist, who some consider to be one of the most influential evolutionary theorists alive today. Robert is one of the scientists who has received support from Jeffrey. "Jeffrey's donations have permitted me to work on whatever I choose, in whatever way I choose," Robert said "Most of this is theoretical work. I think I have recently solved the problem of "honour killings" in terms of the effects of repeated first cousin marriages (Muslim) and long histories of within caste endogamy (Hindu). Jeffrey's support included discussions with him, which were valuable mostly because he is extremely bright, open-minded and widely travelled. They key is that he gives me consistent, warm support without me having to write endless applications for grants, and trusts me to put it to good use, as indeed I do." HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026756

Yet as Trump continues to make anti-science policies and excessive budget cuts, scientists and their supporters can only hope for the best. Science is a unviersal truth, but unfortunately, the truth can be ignored. With the help from private donors though, science can continue to thrive and help us evolve.

reat & Bay 6910 Great Bay, St. Thomas, USVI 00802( BoardStThomas@aol.com 1-340-715-9042 September 13, 2017 Dear Fellow Ritz-Carlton Club Member, If you've been following the TV news, you already know that St. Thomas has taken a dreadful hit by Hurricane Irma. President Donald Trump, who has authorized disaster relief for the Virgin Islands, plans to visit St. Thomas "in the next six or seven days" according to Governor Kenneth Mapp. Our Club appears to have stood up reasonably well, at least when compared with the devastation elsewhere on the island. Many homes have been reduced to rubble, including those of some of our employees as you have heard. The insurance adjusters arrived today, an important step in obtaining the detailed damage and insurance information. The damage seems to grow from the far end of the beach toward the Hotel, with only modest damage in the Lily Building, more damage in Gardenia and Heliconia and even more at the Hotel. About 40% of our Residences are currently usable-with electricity and air conditioning-and they are fully occupied mostly by our employees. Many of these employees have returned to work, notwithstanding the hardships in their personal lives. 70% of the exterior lighting has been restored. Road and pathways on our property have been cleared. Work has also begun on restoring the landscaping, which was decimated by Irma. The Food Center is back open. Some electricity has been restored in the downtown area. Many ATM machines are now operational but with most limiting cash withdrawals to $100. The airport is still closed to commercial traffic. We know that some of our roofs have been damaged. Our air conditioners have been damaged. Some windows were broken and some doors were blown in by the 200 mph gusts. So we know there is water damage. But we don't know how much. Communication is still a major challenge. There is no internet service at the club yet and cell service on our side of the island is extremely spotty. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026759

There has been some looting and other lawlessness in some areas. Local law enforcement is now supported by resources from our federal and state governments. Our on-site team reports that we have been spared that threat. In addition to our own Loss Prevention staff, our Management Company has hired an independent security team to help protect our property. One of the most important questions we must address is just when our Club might open again. The Club is closed through October 7 and Member Services is not presently taking any reservations through December 17. There is a strong possibility that our re-start date could hinge on when the rest of St. Thomas recovers, and it is simply impossible to predict that date at this time. Your Board and the Management team are monitoring this closely and we will keep you apprised. And finally, we thank all who have contributed to the GBCOA Employee Relief Fund. Our Ladies and Gentlemen are in desperate need of your help. They deeply appreciate whatever you may offer to help, as does the Board. Thank you!

Respected and acclaimed as rock stars in the arcane universe of life sciences, global scientists converged in Stockholm in late August this year for the annual Swedish American Life Science Summit (SALSS) meeting, where they unveiled and dissected revolutionary health care platforms. Among them are the use of robotics in surgery, how nanotechnology may make us "forever young," applications of space technology in life sciences, and the "Moonshot" cancer program initiated by former Vice President Joseph Biden. Without doubt, global investors are closely watching organizations such as SALSS to discover the latest innovations and discoveries in life Shutterstock science. This area is replete with groups deeply involved in original research. So one of the major topics discussed at the SALSS conference was "impact investing," or why investors should pay closer attention to investing in life science. "In today's world with an aging population, we observe a higher occurrence of chronic diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune conditions," noted Hans Straberg, chairman of Atlas Copco, and former CEO of Electrolux. "So Big Pharma and the industry are looking beyond the chemical and biologically derived molecules." And as universities and small startups have taken the lead in R&D investments, "Big Pharma is very much dependent on collaborating with them, or acquiring their technologies," he argued. Today Big Pharma has a "really strong position" in life sciences and are Looking for "new blockbusters to replace current stars that are coming off-patent," he said. The current focus, added Straberg, is "very much on finding cures for diseases like cancer, autoimmunity, allergy and infection," and employing various new technologies. So new ideas to address a variety of serious medical issues have always attracted medical luminaries to SALSS, and at this year's conference, the speakers included Biden Cancer Initiative Executive Director Gregory Simon, Nobel Foundation chairman Dr. Carl Henrik Heldin, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Director-General Richard Bergstrom, and Microsoft Healthcare's chief development officer Mathias Ekman. Also among the expert speakers were Pfizer executive vice president and chief of the company's worldwide research development Dr. Michael Dolsten, Secretary-General of the Royal Swedish Academy Life Sciences' Dr. Goran Hansson, International Dr. William A. Haseltine. Recommended by Forbes TRENDING ON FACEBOOK The 1o Most Dangerous U.S. Cities The Inside Story of Marriott's High-Seas Rescue After Irma Stranded 62o Hotel... "Throughout the years, Swedish research and innovation have led the way to disruptive changes within medicine, which has resulted in an immense impact on people's lives and great value for society," argued Dr. Goran K.

Continued from page 1 "Part of this year's conference focus was the current transformation of the HealthTech industry, driven by the ICT and tech players rather than by the traditional medtech companies," said Barbro C.

Also significant, she added, was the participation of numerous women at this year's summit, led by the keynote speaker Dr. Bahija Jallal, executive vice president at AsraZeneca and head of Medimmune. " We are proud and glad that so many prominent women are actually SALSS women, including Dr. Jallal, which made this 2017 summit more exceptional," said Ms. Ehnbom. One of the little known companies that attracted a lot of attention at the conference was AVRA Medical Robotics, a development-stage company based in Orlando, Florida, that has a new generation of "semi-autonomous medical robots for image-capture, navigation, and tissue targeting." Specifically, these "medical robots" perform computer-assisted surgery, with human medical surgeons operating a remote surgical device via a console. In fact, they are not really robots as we know them: AVRA has developed a "novel and truly robotic single-arms platform for the field of aesthetics, skin and wound care as well as dermato-plastic surgery," said Barry F. Cohen, AVRA's CEO and founder. The company's first design integrates software, image guidance, navigation and targeting systems, to allow autonomous needling of skin, he explained. "The future of surgery will be determined by success in gaining precision access to anny area of the human body with the smallest incisions and deploying therapies to specific tissues, glands and organs," asserted Alen York, an AVRA senior executive. Limitations in conventional surgeries, he said, are "demanding more autonomous, intelligent robot systems that go beyond the capability of a human being." AVRA'S platform focused on needling technology "represents a key breakthrough in aesthetics, wound care, and autonomous drug delivery platforms, integration of artificial intelligence and augmented reality that will allow," says York, for a new paradigm in surgical training, planning and treatment. SmartwiseSweden AB is another young biotech that presened at SALSS. It has developed what it calls the Extroducer, a micro catheter for injecting cells, biologics and small molecule therapy directly into organs. "The tiny diameter of the Extroducer, with the width of a hair, enables the needle to penetrate the blood vessel wall and deliver a payload via the smallest blood vessels in the body, making perviously inaccessible regions now available to direct tissue projection," said Jonthan Clarke, CEO of Smartwise. Its product is the first of its kind of versatile device that allows for direct local injection of substances into multiple organs, such as the heart, pancreas, liver and kidney. "We have shown successful and safe pre-clinical delivery of insulin producing cells into the pancreas and modified RNA to the heart," said Clarke, who admitted that he is in talks with multiple major pharmaceutical companies for licensing or other agreements to advance production. Smartwise is still privately owned. ProLung, a Salt Lake city-based biotechnology company focused singularly on improving lung cancer survival, has developed a breakthrough test with precision volume-averaging "bioconductive technology" to collect data to generate a personalized score indicating the likelihood of malignancy. With an estimated one billion people at high-risk for lung cancer worldwide, it has the lowest five-year survival rate, or 16%, of all major cancers, and is the leading cause of cancer death, said Steven C. Eror, founder, president and CEO of ProLung. The copany's test is non-invasive and non-radiating that reduces the wait time from months to just one day, he added. The test has received a "CE Mark and ISO 13485" manufacturing certificate and is approved for sale in the EEA and EFTA countries, said Eror. In the U.S., the ProLung test is still for investigational use only and undergoing multi-site clinical trials for FDA clearance as a "510(k) device," he added. Because the annual SALSS coference has attracted exerts worldwide, it has become a central focus for life science companies to present and exhibit their new products or novel technology to a growing number of medical and scientific experts looking for the next breakthrough product in life sciences. 1 of 1 9/13/2017,8:03 PM HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026763

Ihope it helps. They have clearly decided in advance to try to smear me, and potentially other atheists (I found the remarks in their "miscellaneous facts' telling in this regard), and I felt a detailed response to the false claims was important. If you want to discuss this further I am happy to. I am currently on a plane heading to phoenix. Thanks for forwarding. LMK Begin forwarded message: From: Lawrence Krauss < Subject: Re: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment Date: December 11, 2017 at 10:18:30 AM MST To: Peter Aldhous Cc: I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete, as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses, I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to distort them. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in context. The HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026768

fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so I told her that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and department chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and on several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it, and I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no inappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and explaining the situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was requested. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in physics I had hired while department chair)) and among the administration, along with a very attractive counter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona at the later time I was asked not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on campus. Following this episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I did assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this student, and became more careful in offering advice when talking to students. I was also told by human resources that because it was decided to handle this informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would preserve its confidentiality and remove the complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated that written agreement with you. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026769

Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6, without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and moreover that the 'outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, found various inconsistencies in the allegation, which suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated "It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident." After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any wrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and apparent later claims: "The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. - The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in an unwelcome manner. - The conference attendee who took the 'selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers at the time of the incident (November 2016). - The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference at the time of the incident (November 2016). -The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. - The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took the 'selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested in the course of the investigation." (And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any complaint, were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I attended long enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving carly because I was tired. Even if I had any such intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a thing, including presumably in front of this person's partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don't do such things, is one of the many reasons it never happened.) What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly proud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their behavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026770

interactions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and statt of all genders and ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally. On Dec 10, 2017, at 6:12 PM, Peter Aldhous > wrote: Dr. Krauss: As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in detail. In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident # 6 below). You claimed that "both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and fabricated with malicious intent." We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia Hughes. Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with - Case Western, Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors - have handled complaints and concerns about your behavior during this time. Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, students, and peers in the skeptics movement. I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: Incident 1: In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a volunteer for CFI D.C. At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked her if she was "of age." Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. • You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026771

You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. • She struggled to push you off her. You said, "When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you." When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said "I have to go," and rushed out of the room. Incident 2: In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. • In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without mentioning you by name. "There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me upset for weeks afterward," she wrote. She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and she did. University investigators interviewed both you and the student. On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: "This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment policy." The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she remained at Case. The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics department before setting foot on the campus again. The letter also stated, "Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with students." By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the month before. "The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career," you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. Incident 3: • A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. Incident 4: • You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026772

• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. • You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011. • You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the table. She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. Incident 5: • This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your female companion for sex in your cabin. At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged CFl's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galápagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, however. Incident 6: During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once again. The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her right breast. • She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. "Don't do that," she said. BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 incident. On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting appointments. Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But neither university found against you. • "Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations," Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an inquiry "did not find a violation of university policy." In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. "The University did not find either communication to state a credible allegation," Jewett wrote. HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026773

Miscellaneous facts: • In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. • Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public intellectuals. • You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. • You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and atheists. At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon with you and Dawkins. Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — So Far. Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned "Lawrence Krauss for President." • In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix great societal injustices. Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the dearth of women and minorities in science. "Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias," you said. "It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical evidence." You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in 2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. • Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently pledging $100,000 in 2014. In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: "As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people." In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: "I remain skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know...If you want to condemn me for that, so be it." You were made an honorary member of CFl's board of directors in December 2011. A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, published at around the same time, described incident #5. The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault were "potentially illegal." The second post was quickly taken down.

partners whose names and contact information can be found at the end of the Alert. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), which was signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017, contains the most sweeping federal tax law changes since 1986. Most provisions of the Tax Act take effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. This Client Alert is not intended to be a comprehensive review of this massive legislation. The Alert focuses on certain provisions of the Tax Act that may have the most significant impact on asset management firms, their owners, their investment vehicles, and the investors in such funds. Certain changes made by the Tax Act are permanent but many others are scheduled to expire after 2025 unless extended by further Congressional legislation. I. Carried Interest Survives in Modified Form The Tax Act contains changes to the treatment of "carried interests", but such changes are not as negative as the prior legislative changes that had been proposed but never adopted. The granting of a "future profits only" interest in a partnership in connection with the performances of services to the partnership continues to be eligible for tax-free treatment under the new law. For certain owners of "Applicable Partnership Interests" (of the sort that would generally be issued by an investment partnership to the general partner), the Act applies a three-year holding period requirement for capital gains derived by the partnership (or from the disposition of the profits interest) to be eligible for the long-term capital gains tax rate (instead of the generally applicable one-year holding threshold). The change in carried interest taxation clearly impacts managers of hedge funds more than managers of private equity funds or real estate funds, which typically have a longer than three-year holding period for investments in their portfolio companies or real estate assets. The new tax treatment applies to income realized in tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and existing carried interests are not grandfathered. Thus, it appears that any unrealized capital gains which have already been allocated to a general partner on the books of the partnership would be subject to the new tax treatment at the time the partnership realizes such gains in 2018 or subsequent years. Note, however, that the Tax Act does not change the current federal income tax treatment of carried interest allocations of "qualified dividends" to individuals, which are also taxed at long-term capital gains rates. The capital gains from the carried interest that fail to satisfy the new three-year holding period requirement are treated as "short-term capital gains" which are taxable at ordinary income rates. The "Applicable Partnership Interest" held by the general partner or an affiliate should not include any portion of the partnership interest that is attributable to capital contributed to the partnership by the general partner. The exact manner on how such exception will apply will need to be addressed in future IRS notices or regulations to be issued. Limited partners holding capital interests in private investment funds are also not affected and therefore retain the one-year holding period requirement for long-term capital gain treatment. Note also that the term "Applicable Partnership Interest" does not include an interest held directly or indirectly by a corporation and it currently appears that such exception includes holdings by both C HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026779

corporations and S corporations. It is likely that further guidance will be issued on this question, as it may be advantageous for certain general partners to convert their existing entities that hold the carried interest to S corporations, and such general partners may have until March 15, 2018 to accomplish such conversion. Managers of hedge funds and other partnerships that do not hold capital assets for more than three years before their sale may consider whether the carried interest incentive allocation should be replaced with an incentive fee structure. Also, the reduced after-tax value of a carried interest partnership allocation may impact the management company's executive compensation arrangements. Although an earlier version of the tax legislation would have repealed the exemption in the Code which provides that a limited partner's income is exempt from self-employment tax, the final version of the Tax Act does not contain such change in law. II. New 21% Corporate Income Tax Rate and Reduction of the Maximum Rates Applicable to Individuals The Tax Act reduces the 35 percent corporate rate to a flat 21 percent corporate rate. There is no special higher rate for personal service corporations (as existed under prior law). The new 21 percent rate is effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The corporate alternative tax (AMT) has also been repealed. Such corporate tax changes are permanent. In contrast, the highest applicable federal income tax rate for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers is reduced from 39.6% to 37%. In addition, the 3.8% "add-on" Medicare contributions tax on an individual's net investment income remains in effect. 1. Possible Use of a "C" Corporation as a Tax Shelter Since the new 21% corporate tax rate is now well below the highest rate applicable to high income individuals, some investment managers may conclude that some or all of their management entities that are pass through partnerships should convert to corporate form. In addition, certain partnership funds that are engaged in trade or business, such as active loan origination or real estate activities may find it advantageous to convert to corporate form. The advantage to the corporate form of organization is that the C corporation's net income after taxes is not taxable to its shareholders until it is distributed (e.g., either as a dividend or as a redemption of stock (i.e., as a capital gain)). Corporations that are engaged in active businesses are able to retain and reinvest their earnings. Also relevant to choice of entity decisions is the fact that the Tax Act restricts the ability of individuals to deduct more than $10,000 in state and local taxes, but corporations can continue to deduct such taxes as under prior law. However, there are certain anti-abuse provisions that remain in the Internal Revenue Code that limit the use of a C corporation as a tax shelter. Lurking in the Code is a provision which allows the Internal Revenue Service to impose a 20 percent additional "accumulated earnings" income tax on the "accumulated taxable income" of a corporation if such taxable income is allowed to accumulate "beyond the "reasonable needs of the business". There is a $250,000 safe harbor for most corporations, while personal service corporations are allowed a safe harbor of only $150,000. There is also a 20 percent tax on the "personal holding company income" (i.e., passive investment income) of certain closely held C corporations (i.e., when five or fewer individuals own, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the corporation's stock and at least 60 percent of the corporation's adjusted ordinary income is personal holding company income (e.g., passive investment income)). These penalty taxes on corporations have received little attention in recent decades. However, with the enactment of the sharply lower corporate tax rate, these anti-abuse rules are likely to become a significant focus of the IRS in its audits of tax returns of privately held corporations.

2. The New Deduction for Qualified Business Income of Pass Through Entities Congress also wanted to provide an income tax rate reduction for those businesses that are organized as partnerships or S corporations or which are owned by sole proprietors. In order to meet this goal, the Tax Act provides an income tax deduction for individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers equal to (i) 20 percent of their domestic "qualified business income"; plus (ii) 20 percent of any qualifying dividends from real estate investment trusts, qualifying income from publicly traded partnerships, and gain derived from sale of such publicly traded partnerships that would be treated as ordinary income. Therefore, such deduction results in an effective federal income tax rate of 29.6% on such qualifying income for a top bracket individual. The deduction does not apply to investment income (i.e., capital gains, dividends (other than certain ordinary income dividends paid by REITs), and most interest income). In addition, it does not apply to reasonable compensation income and guaranteed payments paid to the taxpayer from the business. The 20 percent of "qualified business income" deduction described in (i) above is also generally limited to the greater of either (a) 50% of the W-2 wages paid with respect to the qualified trade or business, or (b) the sum of 25% of the W-2 wages paid with respect to such business plus 2.5% of the unadjusted tax basis of all qualified business property of such business. Thus, if the partnership, S corporation or sole proprietorship does not pay "W-2 wages" and the second limitation is a minor amount or not applicable, the owner or pass through taxpayer's tax deduction would be a minor amount or zero. Unfortunately, partners or owners of certain types of professional service businesses, including financial services providers, investment managers, brokers, consultants, lawyers and accountants (and others), are not permitted to claim the "qualified business income" deduction unless the taxpayer's adjusted gross income is below certain levels ($207,500 for individuals and $365,000 for married couples filing jointly). Even in such case, the benefit of the available deduction is phased out ratably as the taxpayer's income exceeds $157,500 if single, or $315,000 if filing a joint tax return. Therefore, fund managers organized as pass through entities are not likely to, and investment funds organized as partnerships will not, derive a significant benefit from this deduction. IlI. ISSUES FOR PARTNERSHIP FUNDS 1. Repeal of Itemized Deductions Previously Available to Non-Corporate Taxpayers for Non-Business Investment Expenses For 2018 through 2025, the Tax Act completely repeals the deductions previously allowed to individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers for "miscellaneous itemized deductions" (which were subject to a 2% floor and a phase-out rule under prior law). It is important to note that for individual investors in partnership funds that are not treated as engaged in a trade or business, the investor's share of the fund's investment expenses, including management fees, would now pass through as non-deductible miscellaneous itemized deductions. If the fund is properly classified as an active "trader" rather than a mere investor, then such expenses would be completely deductible as trade or business expenses. This Tax Act change obviously puts considerable strain on the fund manager and its tax advisors with respect to the trader vs. investor issue. At this time, there is a lack of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service on what level of trading activity is sufficient for a professionally managed fund to qualify as a "trader fund". In cases where a partnership fund's expected activities are not likely to qualify for trader status or another trade or business, the fund's sponsor may find that US high net worth individuals may now prefer to invest in the offshore corporate feeder fund instead of the onshore partnership fund. The US income tax reason for this would be that since the offshore feeder is classified as a corporation for US tax purposes, its net income would be calculated under the rules applicable to corporations, for which HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026781

there are no miscellaneous itemized deductions. Thus, assuming that the foreign feeder is a passive foreign investment company (PFIC), if the US high net worth shareholder is able to make the "qualified electing fund" election, the net income the investor would be required to report on his federal income tax return would be calculated after deducting all of the corporation's expenses, including management fees and investment expenses. 2. Non-US Partner's Gain on Sale of Partnership Interest may be Taxable as US Trade or Business Income; New Withholding Requirements apply to the Purchaser or the Fund The Tax Act specifically provides that gains realized by a non-US partner on a sale or exchange of a partnership interest will be treated as effectively connected US trade or business income ("ECI") to the extent that such partner would have been allocated ECI had the partnership sold all of its assets. This provision is consistent with the IRS position in Revenue Ruling 91-32, and overrules a recent Tax Court case which had rejected the position taken in such IRS Ruling and instead held that since a partnership interest is treated as a capital asset, the foreign person's gain on its sale could escape US income taxation as a non-business capital gain. To the extent that a partnership has any ECI-generating assets (including US real property interests), a seller of a partnership interest will have to provide a certificate that it is not a foreign person, and in the absence of such a certificate a purchaser (which could include the fund) will be required to withhold 10% of the gross purchase price. Further, the Tax Act provides that if the purchaser does not withhold, the partnership is required to withhold on distributions to such purchaser to cover the withholding. The Tax Act provides that the new withholding obligation for purchasers is effective for sales or other dispositions of partnership interests after December 31, 2017. 3. New Limitation on Deduction of Net Interest Expense Under prior law, subject to some restrictions and limitations, business interest paid or accrued by a business was fully deductible. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits the deduction for "net business interest" expense for every type of business, regardless of entity form, to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income. Business interest paid or accrued after the effective date on indebtedness, including debt that was incurred prior to the effective date of the Tax Act, is subject to this limitation. The term business interest does not include investment interest described in Code section 163(d). Operating companies, such as management entities, and investment funds that are engaged in a business and have outstanding indebtedness could be subject to such deduction limitation. For this purpose, "adjusted taxable income" is determined at the entity level for partnerships, and is similar to EBITDA (i.e., net earnings before deducting interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for taxable years 2018 through 2021. A more restrictive 20% of EBIT limitation (net earnings before deducting interest expense and taxes) applies for 2022 and later years. Certain taxpayers are exempted for the new interest deductibility limitation, including small businesses with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less for the three prior taxable years, as well as real estate businesses that elect out of such limitation. The Conference Committee Report on the Tax Act clarified that interest paid on shareholder loans by a blocker corporation is "business interest" that is subject to this new limitation. Blocker corporations for a lending business would have business interest income, which reduces the effect of this new limitation on net business interest expense (i.e., deductible business interest expense in excess of business interest income). 4. Deemed Repatriation Tax HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026782

One of the major tax raising provisions in the Tax Act is a one-time tax imposed on the accumulated earnings held in foreign subsidiaries of US companies. This provision is broader that it may first appear. Under the Tax Act, any 10% US shareholder of a foreign corporation (determined on December 31, 2017) will be required to include in income, for the taxable year 2017, its proportionate share of the foreign corporation's undistributed earnings, if the foreign corporation is either a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) or has at least one 10% US shareholder that is a corporation. This law change could generate significant phantom income with respect to 10%-or-greater owned foreign portfolio companies both (i) for US taxable investors (including the general partner and its owners) in partnership funds organized in the United States and/or for US sponsors of non-US funds. The Tax Act provides for reduced tax rates on such income for corporate investors of 8% (for earnings invested in tangible business assets) and 15.5% (for cash and cash equivalents), and 9.05% and 17.54% for investors taxed as individuals. 5. Tax-Free Section 1031 Like Kind Exchanges Eliminated Except for Real Property Transactions The Tax Act eliminates the ability to qualify for tax-free exchange treatment under Code section 1031 if the property being exchanged is personal property. Consequently, for transactions occurring after December 31, 2017, exchanges of artwork, equipment, vehicles or other personal property held for investment or for use in a business, including Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, for like kind property will not eligible for Section 1031 tax treatment. Exchanges of real property continue to be eligible for Section 1031 exchange treatment. 6. Certain Tax Accounting Rules Have Been Revised Under prior law, net operating losses (NOLs) could be carried back two years and carried forward for twenty years. Under the Tax Act, NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 generally cannot be carried back, but can be carried forward indefinitely. However, only 80% of a company's taxable income is permitted to be offset by NOLs. The remainder of the unused NOLs will carry forward. The Tax Act also expands the category of corporations and partnerships that are eligible to use the cash method of accounting. Certain businesses may derive a tax benefit by switching from the accrual method to the cash method of accounting. 7. Deferred Compensation The Tax Act generally leaves the current tax rules for deferred compensation intact. However, the Act also includes a new deferral provision for certain types of broad-based employee equity, which may apply to certain private companies. 8. Estate and Gift Tax Changes In 2017, an individual could give or transfer at death up to $5,490,000 without paying gift or estate taxes. The Tax Act doubles the federal estate and gift tax unified exemption amount for estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2017, and inflation adjustments will continue to apply. Therefore, in 2018, an individual has approximately an $11.2 million exemption, and a married couple has approximately $22.4 million of available shelter from federal gift and estate taxation. Note that the large exemption which applies to gifts may be useful in federal income tax planning. For example, large lifetime gifts of appreciated securities, artwork and other personal property (including possibly, a carried interest) to relatives who are in lower income tax brackets, or who reside in states with lower, or no state income taxes could save the family substantial federal income and/or state income taxes when such property is sold by the recipient of the gift.
