The pace of layoffs  announced by U.S.-based companies rose for a second-straight month in July, as the U.S. energy patch once again shed thousands of workers. Employers last month said they would cut 45,346 jobs, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
The Labor Department releases its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Forecasts call for new filings of 265,000 last week. The Commerce Department issues June factory orders at 10 a.m. ET. A drop of 1.7 percent is expected. Among the companies reporting quarterly results this morning are Kellogg (K) and Time (TIME). This afternoon's earnings list includes Activision Blizzard (ATVI), LinkedIn (LNKD), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Priceline Group (PCLN), Zillow (ZG), and Zynga (ZNGA). STOCKS TO WATCH

Square (SQ) reported a smaller-than-expected loss, and revenue that exceed estimates. The mobile payments firm was helped by an increase in the number of merchants signing on to use the service. Square is run by Jack Dorsey who's also CEO of Twitter (TWTR). GoDaddy (GDDY) lost 11 cents per share for the second quarter, 4 cents more than anticipated, although the web registrar's revenue did beat analyst estimates. The company also gave upbeat full year guidance. Nokia (NOK) said it would cut more costs after reporting a second-quarter loss of about $738 million. The telecom equipment maker's profit was down 45 percent from a year earlier. Toyota (TM) cut its full year profit forecast due to a bigger hit from the stronger Japanese yen. The automaker expects operating profit to be down 44
 percent from a year ago. Viacom (VIAB) reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.05 per share, 4 cents above estimates, while revenue also beat forecasts. A drop in media networks results was more than countered by growth in the film division. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) reported adjusted quarterly profit of 45 cents per share, beating estimates by 8 cents. Revenue was essentially in-line. The media giant increased the size of its stock buyback and raised its semi-annual dividend. MetLife (MET) came in well short of the $1.35 per share consensus estimate with adjusted quarterly profit of 83 cents per share, while the insurance company's revenue missed as well. The shortfall was largely due to higher losses on derivative investments. Transocean (RIG) reported a sharp drop in second quarter
 profit, but its adjusted earnings of 17 cents per share were well above forecasts for a breakeven quarter. Revenue also topped estimates, even as the oilfield services firm dealt with slumping demand. TripAdvisor (TRIP) earned an adjusted 38 cents per share, 4 cents below estimates. The travel website operator's revenue also fell short of forecasts. TripAdvisor had rising expenses during the quarter, as well as lower revenue from hotel bookings. Jack In The Box (JACK) came in 20 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.07 per share, while the restaurant chain's revenue exceeded analyst estimates as well. Current quarter earnings guidance wasbelow forecasts. WATERCOOLER
