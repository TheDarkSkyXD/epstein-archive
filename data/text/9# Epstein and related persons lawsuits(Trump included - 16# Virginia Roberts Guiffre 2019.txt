Hi Buddy, 


You are absolutely right...nail biting is an understatement of the century!!! 
We didn't have any trouble with spiders or anything like that yesterday, it was more my daughter that gave everyone a 


spook! She wandered off when I turned ny back to look at homemade jam and found her outside in the bush chasing the

My fingers and toes are crossed and I'm thinking positive!!!

Hi Jarred 


Hopefully you have Virginia’s book pitch by now. 


She has some amazing names which she can share with you in confidence and | think she also has a human interest 
story that could appeal to the Oprah/female set as well as the Wall Streeters who follow Epstein — a hedge fund king. 


Here are a few of our stories about Virginia, plus some examples of the massive US and other international media 
pickup. Vanity Fair are doing a piece | believe in their August issue. The FBI have reopened the Epstein case due to 
Virginia’s revelations. | also am attaching a link to a NY Magazine profile of Epstein.....written before his world 
combusted. The FBI believe he was essentially running a private — and mobile -- brothel for some of the world’s richest 
and most influential men. 


He got off the first ime round after retaining Kenneth Starr (who witchhunted Bill Clinton) and Alan Dershowitz (von 
Bulow's appeal lawyer, who inspired the movie Reversal of Fortune). The US Justice Dept is investigating corruption 
allegations against at least one prosecutor involved in the case. 


Best regards, 


Sharon

didn't see them take pictures of the backs of them. 
I'm not too sure who. 
QO You don't remember sending to them a 


photograph that included this wood around another 


photograph? 
A No. 
Q Okay. You have mentioned a journalist by 


the name of Sharon Churcher. 

A Yes. 

Q You are aware that Sharon Churcher 
published news stories about you? 

A Ves. 

MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 
Go ahead. 

QO (BY MS. MENNINGER) Is anything that you 
have read in Sharon Churcher's news stories about you 
untrue? 

A I think Sharon did print some things that 
I think she elaborated or maybe misheard. But, I 
mean, if you have a specific document to show me, I'd 
love to look at it and read it and tell you what I 
think. 

QO Is there anything, as you sit here today, 
that you know of that Sharon Churcher printed about 
you that is not true?

A Not off the top of my head. If you show 
me, like, a news clipping article or something, I can 
definitely read it for you. 

Q Is there anything that you know of that 
Sharon Churcher has printed about Ghislaine Maxwell 
that is not true? 

A No, not off -- no, not off the top of my 
head. 

QO Is there anything that you recall saying 
to Sharon Churcher that she then printed something 
different than what you had said to her? 

A Yeah, I've read stuff. I mean, I just -- 
I can't remember what, but I read something that I 
think was, Oh, she got that wrong. I can't remember 
an exact example off the top of my head. 

Q Did you ever complain to Sharon Churcher 
about things that she got wrong? 

A I didn't see a point. I might have, but 
I -- I didn't see a point really because it's already 
printed, you know. 

Q You had a fairly voluminous set of 
communications with Sharon Churcher by e-mail, 
correct? 

MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 
A Voluminous, like a lot of them?

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Yes. 
A Yes. 
Q And during any of those communications, do 


you know whether she printed things about you after 
you had any of those communications? 
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 

A I don't know. I know a lot of stuff was 
printed, and I never really stopped to read who 
printed the article, or wrote the article, I should 
say. Sorry. 

QO (BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. I'll show you 
Defendant's Exhibit 7. 

(Exhibit 7 marked.) 
THE DEPONENT: Thank you. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) I'll let you read 
through the statements on the first page there, and 
if there is anything that is not absolutely true, 
just put a check by it and we'll come back to it. 

A It's not very clear how she wrote it. wT 
flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine 
Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black 
helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her." 

That wasn't an eyewitness statement. 
Like, I didn't see her do it. Ghislaine was the one 
who told me about that; that she's the one who flew

Bill. 
Q All right. If you just want to put a 
check by it, then we'll just come back and talk about 


each one. 


A Okay. 
Q Just to move things along. 
A Okay. I have made three checkmarks. 
Q All right. 
MS. MCCAWLEY: And I just -- before you 


continue, I just want to identify for the record, 
since this doesn't have any identifiers on it, are 
you representing that these are statements from 
Sharon Churcher? 

MS. MENNINGER: I'm not representing 
anything. I'm asking the witness questions about 
these statements. I asked her is anything on here 
not true. That's all I asked her. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) So which ones did you 
put checkmarks by, Ms. Giuffre? 

A I'd have been -- I'm sorry. "I'd have 
been about 17 at the time. I flew to the Caribbean 
with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick 
up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had 
bought her."

A "Donald Trump was also a good friend of 


Jeffrey's. He didn't partake in any sex with any of 
us but he flirted with me. He'd laugh and tell 


Jeffrey, ‘you've got the life.'" 


Q Other than the three you've just 
mentioned -- 

A Yeah. 

Q -—- everything else on here is absolutely 
accurate? 


MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 

A Yes. Well, to the best of my 
recollection, yes. 

QO (BY MS. MENNINGER) All right. What is 
inaccurate about, "I'd have been about 17 at the 
time. I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then 
Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge 
black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her"? 

A Because it makes it kind of sound like an

eyewitness thing. 

oO Okay. Did you say that statement to 
Sharon Churcher? 

A I said to Sharon that Ghislaine told me 
that she flew Bill in the heli- -- the black 
helicopter that Jeffrey bought her, and I just wanted 
to clarify that I didn't actually see her do that. I 
heard from Ghislaine that she did that. 

Q You heard that from Ghislaine, and then 
you reported to Sharon Churcher that you had heard 
that from Ghislaine. 

A Correct. 

MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 

A I heard a lot of things from Ghislaine 
that sounded too true -- too outrageous to be true, 
but you never knew what to believe, so... 

QO (BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. And after 
Sharon Churcher printed what she said you said, did 
you complain to her that it was inaccurate? 

A I might have verbally with her, but again, 
I didn't see a point in making a hissy over it 


because what was done was done. She had already 


printed. 
QO What was inaccurate about, "I used to get 
frightened flying with her but Bill" said -- "had the

Secret Service with him and I remember him talking 
about what a good job she did"? 

A I just don't remember saying that to her. 
I don't remember saying I remember him talking about 


what a good job she did. 


QO All right. 
A I just don't remember that at all. 
QO Okay. And I guess, just to be clear, my 


questions wasn't do you remember saying this to 
Sharon Churcher; my question is, is that statement 
accurate? 
MS. MCCAWLEY: Well, objection. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did you used to get 
frightened flying with her? 

A Yes. 

Q Okay. Did Bill have the Secret Service 
with him? 

A They were there, but not like on the -- 
not where we were eating. 

QO Do you remember Bill talking about what a 
good job she did? 

A I don't remember that. 

Q So what is inaccurate about that 
statement? 

A I just -- it's inaccurate because I don't

I don't remember that. 

QO Does it inaccurately suggest that Bill had 

the Secret Service with him on a helicopter? 
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 

A Well, not being an eyewitness to it, I 
wouldn't be able to tell you. I can't tell you what 
I don't know. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) And do you believe you 
said that statement to Sharon Churcher? 

A I mean, Sharon and I talked a lot, and if 
she misheard me or just wrote it in the way that she 
thought she should, I have no control over that. So 


I'm not too sure. 


QO Did she record your interviews? 
A Some of them. Some of them she didn't. I 
mean, we, like -- we, like, met for like a week, and 


we spent a lot of time together, and then even after 
that we just continued, like, kind of a friendship. 
Q All right. What's inaccurate about the 


last statement on that page? 


A "Donald Trump was also a good friend of 
Jeffrey's." That part is true. 
"He didn't partake in any" of -- "any sex 
with any of us but he flirted with me." It's true

that he didn't partake in any sex with us, and but 
it's not true that he flirted with me. Donald Trump 
never flirted with me. 

Then the next sentence is, "He'd laugh and 
tell Jeffrey, ‘you've got the life.'" I never said 
that to her. 

Q When you say, “he didn't partake in any 
sex with any of us," who is "us"? 

A Girls. Just -- 

QO How do you know who Donald Trump -- Trump 
had sex with? 

A Oh, I didn't physically see him have sex 
with any of the girls, so I can't say who he had sex 
with in his whole life or not, but I just know it 
wasn't with me when I was with other girls. 

QO And who were the other girls that you were 
with in Donald Trump's presence? 

A None. There -- I worked for Donald Trump, 
and I've met him probably a few times. 

QO When have you met him? 

A At Mar-a-Lago. My dad and him, I wouldn't 
say they were friends, but my dad knew him and they 
would talk all the time -- well, not all the time but 
when they saw each other.

Jeffrey Epstein's presence with one another? 

A No. 

Q What is the basis for your statement that 
Donald Trump is a good friend of Jeffrey's? 

A Jeffrey told me that Donald Trump is a 
good friend of his. 

Q But you never observed them together? 

A No, not that I can actually remember. I 


mean, not off the top of my head, no. 


QO When did Donald Trump flirt with you? 

A He didn't. That's what's inaccurate. 

QO Did you ever see Donald Trump at Jeffrey's 
home? 

A Not that I can remember. 

QO On his island? 

A No, not that I can remember. 

Q In New Mexico? 

A No, not that I can remember. 

Q In New York? 

A Not that I can remember. 

QO All right. If you could turn to the 


second page and read through those. Let me know if 
any of those are inaccurate. Just put a check by 
them and then we'll come back.

MS. MCCAWLEY: Before you go, Virginia, 
I'm going to object to the use of the second page of 
this document. There's no time frame on it. There's 
no source reference to it, so it's entirely unclear 


where this has come from. 


QO (BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. Are you done? 

A Yes. 

QO Okay. What's the first one you've put a 
check by? 

A "The hammock photo was all over the 
houses," in parentheses. And Bill Clinton and -- I'm 


sorry, "Bill Clinton and Andrew," in parentheses, 
"had to have seen it." 

"All over the houses" is not my statement 
and an exaggeration. They did have that picture in 
the houses. And I believe, if I remember the 
conversation correctly, she asked, Could have Bill 
Clinton and Andrew seen the picture? And I said, 
Yes, it's possible that they could have seen it. 

So, I mean, it's just that -- it's not 
that it's totally inaccurate. I just think it's like 
journalist writing, had to have seen it. It doesn't 
mean they saw it. I just think that if it was in 
front of them, they would have seen it. 

oO So she told you that -- you told her that

the photograph was in the houses -- houses? 

A Yes. I know he had it in New York on his 
desk. I know he had it in Palm Beach. I know he had 
it in the Caribbean. And I don't know if he had it 


in New Mexico. I can't remember New Mexico. Maybe. 


QO Where in Palm Beach was the photograph? 
A The massage room. 
Q Was that -- you did not say that they -- 


it was all over the houses? 

A Correct. All over the houses would imply 
that it's everywhere in the house, so... 

Q You did not say that Andrew and Clinton 
had to have seen the photograph? 

A Correct. I -- it was more of a, if they 
were in front of it, they would have seen it, kind of 
a thing. I'm not saying it right. But it wasn't, 
like, had to have seen it. 

QO All right. What's the next statement that 
you put a check by? 

A I'm sorry, excuse me. My kids shared a 
beautiful cough with me again. 

"I spent four years as a millionaire's 
personal masseuse." 

Q What is inaccurate about that statement? 

A We now know, according to the timelines

that Mar-a-Lago was able to provide for us, that it 
was not four years. 

Q How many years was it? 

A More like 2-1/2, I think, if I'm right, or 
two. I'm sorry, I'm really bad at math. But yes, 
the two period. 

QO What's the next statement that you have 
put a check by? 

A "I was a pedophile's dream." I think she 


took that out of context and made that her own little 


headline. 

QO Did you say that to her? 

A I said something along the line like, I -- 
the -- the pedos loved me because I would do 


everything that they wanted for them. But do I think 


that -- yeah, I -- I know she made that line up 
herself, the pedos -- pedophile's dream. 
QO What's the next one you put a check by? 
A I put a question mark next to the next 


one. It says, "Three years later she was reunited 
with her family." I don't know what that pertains 
to. I don't know what timeline that means. 

Q Was there a period of three years where 
you were not with your family? 

A There's been longer periods than that

that -- when I wasn't with my family. That's what I 
mean, I don't understand where that comes from. 
"Three years later she was reunited with her family." 
QO Prior to 2002, was there a period of three 
years where you were not with your family? 
A No. 
Q Okay. Did you say to Sharon Churcher, 
three years later, she was reunited with her family? 
A That's what I don't understand. I don't 


even know what that time periods pertains to. 


oO Do you recall saying that to Sharon 
Churcher? 

A No. 

QO What's the next one you put a check by? 

A "After about two years he started to ask 


me to entertain his friends." 

oO What's wrong with that statement? 

A It wasn't two years. I don't know where 
she got that from. 

Q Okay. How long was it? 

A Like, I can't give you an exact time 
period, but it wasn't right in the beginning. It was 
after my training, or so to speak training. So, I 
mean, my best guesstimate would be anywhere between 
four to six months.

Q So you did not say to Sharon Churcher, 
"After about two years he asked me to entertain his 


friends"? 


A Correct. 

QO What's the next one you put a check by? 

A That's it. That's all I put a checkmark 
next to. 

Q So the rest of these are absolutely 
accurate? 

A Nothing a journalist writes is absolutely 
accurate, but it's -- it sounds accurate, yes. 

QO Do you recall Jeffrey Epstein saying to 


you, "I've got a good friend and I need you to fly to 
the island to entertain him, massage him and make him 
feel how you make me feel"? 


MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 


Go ahead. 
A I do remember him saying that, and I think 
that's more of a general- -- generalization for all 
the times that I was sent to the -- where is this -- 


the island to entertain people. And that would be a 
quote that she made but from my words saying that's 
what he said to me when I had to go be with these 
people that he sent me to.

sentence to her? 
MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 
A I -- I can't remember. Like I said, I 


think it's more of a generalization. 


QO (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did you meet Al Gore? 

A Yes. 

Q Did you meet Heidi Klum? 

A Yes. 

Q Did you meet Naomi Campbell? 

A Yes. 

QO Did you go on a six-week trip with Epstein 
in 2001? 

A Yeah. Yes. Sorry. 

Q When in 2001 did you go on a six-week trip 


with him? 

A I don't remember exactly when it was, but 
it's that -- it's the one where we went to Tangier, 
Morocco, England. I can't remember where else we 
went. France. 

QO Did the FBI tell you that Epstein had 
hidden cameras watching you the entire time, even 
when you were in the bathroom? 

A Yes. 

Q Did the FBI tell you "Everything he did 
was illegal because I was under age"?

A Yes. 

QO Who in the FBI told you that? 

A Whichever agent I was talking to. 

QO Which agent were you talking to? 

A I can't remember. I know I was talking to 
Jason Richards, and there was a girl, I think -- I 
want -- I want to say her name was Christina Pryor, 


just off the top of my head. And then I think there 
was two other agents actually at the consulate 


building. I don't remember their names. Very hazy. 


0 When was this conversation with the FBI? 
A After Sharon printed the articles, the 
first articles that came out. I don't know how many 


she printed, but when the first articles came out, 
after that the FBI contacted me. 

Q And was the statement that the FBI told 
you "Everything he did was illegal because I was 
under age," in response to you telling them that you 
were age 15 when you met Jeffrey? 

MS. MCCAWLEY: Objection. 

A Well, that was the closest proximity I had 
to go off of. 

QO (BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. 

A So, yes. Although I still was under age, 
I mean, even if I was 16 and 17.

Q Okay. And then if you could do the last 
page, same way; a check by anything that's not 
absolutely accurate. 

MS. MCCAWLEY: Okay. I'm going to object 
to this as the last page has no identifier of time or 
source on it. 

A Okay. I'm ready. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) All right. Which ones 
are inaccurate? 

A The first one is, "Virginia got a 
part-time job as a changing room assistant." I was a 
full-time person there. Sorry. 

Q Okay. So did you say that to Sharon? 

A Again, I don't remember that exact 
conversation, but I know it was a full-time job, 
and -- I mean, full-time as in the, you know, the 9 
to 5 or whatever hours it was, so it wasn't 
part-time. I don't remember the exact conversation 
that we had. 

QO Okay. What's the next thing you put a 
check by? 

A I put a question mark next to, "Another 
lady led me into Jeffrey's bedroom. The lady walked 
me straight through into the massage room." 

I have no idea what circumstance that

pertains to. Again, I don't know what that means. I 


don't even know what other lady she's talking about. 


So... 

Q So you don't recall saying that to Sharon 
Churcher? 

A Correct. I don't even know what it means. 

Q Okay. What's the next one you have a 
check by? 

A "Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills 


and told to return the next day. That was the 
beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein." 

Q All right. What's wrong about that 
statement? 

A Well, again, I just want to say that the 
four years was inaccurate based upon memory and not 
an actual timeline that we were able to get. 

Q Did you say that to Sharon Churcher, that 
it was four years? 

A I don't know if I said that to her or -- 
oh, yeah, did I tell her it was four years? Yes, I 
did. I'm sorry. 

QO Okay. What else did you put a check by? 

A Well, this one is a question mark again.

It wasn't really a diary. It was, like, I 
don't know how many pages of something that I wrote, 


and Sharon used it, so... 


QO Did you tell Sharon it was your diary 
entry? 

A She knew it wasn't a diary entry. No. 

QO Okay. Were you a teen sex slave? 

A Yes. 

QO What's the next one you have a checkmark 
by? 

A "T also saw Prince Andrew at a Ranch in 


New Mexico." 

oO Did you tell that to Sharon Churcher? 

A No. And I think it's a mistake. Maybe 
she meant somewhere else, but because we had been 
talking about so much, maybe she just put New Mexico. 
I don't think Sharon intentionally lied on any of 
these. I just -- I think we talked so much over a 
period of a week, and then after that we had phone 
conversations, and so on and so forth, that some of 


the information just got misheard or mishandled, or 


whatever. 
Q And what was printed was inaccurate? 
A Was that printed? I don't -- I don't 


remember reading that in the papers, but if it was

you put a checkmark by in the papers? 

A There's been so much printed, it's hard 
for me to remember. I mean, yes, it does sound like 
stuff I read before. 

Q When you spoke with Sharon Churcher, you 


agreed to waive your anonymity, right? 


A I did. 
Q Why did you agree to do that? 
A I felt it was time for me to tell my 


story. I felt it was a good time for me to come 
forward. I had done so much healing, and I thought 
that it would be good for other people to hear what's 
going on, how it's happening, how vulnerable other 
girls can be and not even know the damage that it 
causes later in life. And I just thought it would be 


the right thing to do to come forward. 


QO You authorized her to publish your name? 
A I did. 

oO And your photograph? 

A Yes. 

QO In 2011?

VIRGINIA GIUFFRE VOLUME II 11/14/2016 563 


Case 18-2868, Document 286, 08/09/2019, 2628248, Page40 of 55 


Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his Caribbean island for Mr. 
Clinton shortly after he left office. 


| I'd have been about 17 at the time. I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine 
Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her. 


I remember she was very excited because she got her license around the first year we met. 


| [used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the secret service with him and I remember 
J him talking about what a good job she did. 


I don't remember seeing Bill again on the trip but ] assume Ghislaine flew him back. 


Virginia disclosed that Mr. Clinton's vice-president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also 
guests of Epstein on his island. 


Virginia said that yet another American liberal icon, Senator George Mitchell, frequently visited 
Epstein's New York residence. Mr. Mitchell, aged 77, was very close to Jeffrey, Virginia 
recalled. 


I also met Naomi Campbell at a birthday party of hers on a yacht in the South of France. She is a 
friend of Ghislaine's but she was a real bitch to me. 


d Donald Trump was also a good friend of Jeffrey's. He didn't partake in any sex with any of us 
~ but he flirted with me. He'd laugh and tell Jeffrey, 'you've got the life.’

Ghislaine took nude picture of me lying naked in a hammock, posed with my legs open, a bit 
provocatively that I gave to Jeffrey for his birthday. 


7 The hammock photo was "all over the houses" and Bill Clinton and Andrew “had to have seen" 
~ it. 


JS I spent four years as millionaire's personal masseuse. 
I was living on the streets, beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. 
While on the streets, I slept with men for money. 
J Iwasa paedophile’s dream. 
V Three years later she was reunited with her family. 
J After about two years, he started to ask me to ‘entertain’ his friends. 


She recalls he said “I’ve got a good friend and I need you to fly to the island to entertain him, 
massage him and make him feel how you make me feel.” 


The way it usually worked was I'd been sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in 
the Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated. 


I met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell. 


She was, she says, delighted when Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 
2001. 


FBI told me that Epstein had hidden cameras watching me the entire time even when I was in the 
bathroom. I was so embarrassed. 


The FBI told me everything he did was illegal because I was under age. 


Case 18-2868, Document 286, 08/09/2019, 2628248, Page42 of 55 


J Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant. 


I told Ghislaine I wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy 
gentleman who was looking for a traveling masseuse. I’d get training and be paid well. 


- Another lady led me into Jeffrey's bedroom. The lady walked me straight through into the 
i massage room. 


Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to return the next day. That was the beginning 
if of the four years she spent with Epstein. 


/ Radar Online has obtained exclusive "Diary entries" of "Teen Sex Slave". 
I led Prince Andrew into the upstairs bathroom next to the room I was staying in. 


I was doing my best trying to put on a good show for him by slowly undressing and started to 
pour a bath. 


He was caressing every part of my naked body and filling my head with endless compliments 
about my blossoming figure. 


He paid careful attention to my toes and was licking them. 


| I also saw Prince Andrew at the Ranch in New Mexico.

go sign with an agent as my contract is finished with "Mail On Sunday"... YEAH!! Sandra and I have been working really 
hard to get me ready for my trip to the U.S in a few weeks and I was wondering if I could use your advice again. She has 
got an INT'L agent who is interested in speaking with me and I don't want to say "Yes" to the first bite because I'm not su 
what to look for in an agent. What could you recommend that I do? I will send Jarred and Irene (your recommended agen 
a copy of the synopsis and sample chapters but how do I choose the right one for "The Story"? Do you know anyone else 
that might be interested in this as well? If so, i am keen on speaking with anyone who might be. I am soooooo000 excited 
about this and will keep you updated with the progressing events. When I am in New York we have to meet up for some 
city shopping and take the kids to Central Park to see the Zoo, given there will be no masturbating kangaroo's for you to

did you author that entire manuscript? 

A Yes, I. did.

as you sit here right now, is there anything in that 
manuscript about Ghislaine Maxwell that is untrue? 

A I don't believe so. Like I said, there is 
a lot of stuff that I actually have left out of here. 

Q Um-hum. 

A So there is a lot more information I could 
put in there. But as far as Ghislaine Maxwell goes, 
I would like to say that there is 99.9 percent of it 
would be to the correct knowledge. 

Q All right. Is there anything that you -- 
and I understand you're doing this from memory. Es. 
there anything that you recall, as you're sitting 
here today, about Ghislaine Maxwell that is contained 
in that manuscript, that is not true? 

A You know, I haven't read this in a very 
long time. I don't believe that there's anything in 
here about Ghislaine Maxwell that is not true. 

MR. EDWARDS: I'd just ask, Counsel, if 
you have anything specific to show her about 
Ghislaine Maxwell -- 

MS. MENNINGER: I'll ask questions.

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page9 of 74 


I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

There can be no question that disputed issues of material facts preclude granting 
summary judgment when, in a one-count defamation case, Defendant presents the Court with a 
68-page memorandum of law, a 16-page statement of purported facts, and approximately 700 
pages of exhibits. The sheer scope of Defendant’s response, if anything, conclusively 
demonstrates that volumes of disputed facts surround the core question of whether Defendant 
abused Ms. Giuffre. Indeed, Defendant acknowledges a dispute between the parties as to whether 
she abused Ms. Giuffre. See, e.g., Motion for Summary Judgment at 1; Motion to Dismiss at 1. 
This Court already said that this disputed factual question is central to this case: 

Either Plaintiff is telling the truth about her story and Defendant’s involvement, or 

defendant is telling the truth and she was not involved in the trafficking and 

ultimate abuse of Plaintiff. The answer depends on facts. Defendant’s statements 

are therefore actionable as defamation. Whether they ultimately prove to meet the 

standards of defamation (including but not limited to falsity) is a matter for the 

fact-finder. 
Order Denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss at 10. While this fact remains in dispute, 
summary judgment is foreclosed. 

But even turning to Defendant’s claims, the avalanche of aspersions she casts upon Ms. 
Giuffre and her counsel should not distract the Court from the fact that the instant motion cannot 
come within sight of meeting the standard for an award of summary judgment. The most glaring 
and emblematic example of the Defendant’s far-fetched claims appears in her attempt to move 
away from her defamatory statement by arguing that it was her attorney and not her, who issued 
the defamatory statement for the press to publish, though she is forced to admit the statement 
was made on her behalf. This is an untenable position to take at trial, and an impossible 


argument to advance at the summary judgment stage, as both the testamentary and documentary 


evidence positively refute that argument. Defendant incorrectly asks this Court to make a factual 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page10 of 74 


finding that her defamatory press release was actually a legal opinion, issued not by her, but by 
her lawyer, to the media, despite documentary evidence showing otherwise. 

Defendant also argues that she has proven the truth of her statement calling Ms. Giuffre a 
liar with respect to the statements Ms. Giuffre made about Defendant. To the contrary, 
voluminous evidence, both documentary and testimonial from numerous witnesses, corroborate 
Ms. Giuffre’s account of Defendant’s involvement in the sexual abuse and trafficking of Ms. 
Giuffre. Just to briefly highlight a few, Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her 
under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for 
Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.' Tony Figueroa testified that 
Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that 
Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre. Even more 
shockingly, the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old 
Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with 
Epstein and she refused. This is a fraction of the testimony that will be elicited at trial about 
Defendant’s involvement in the sexual abuse and trafficking of Ms. Giuffre. 

Defendant’s primary argument in support of her contention that she did not abuse and 
traffic Ms. Giuffre as a minor child is that employment records show that Ms. Giuffre was either 
sixteen or seventeen when Defendant recruited her from her job at Mar-a-Lago for sex with 
Epstein, not fifteen-years-old as Plaintiff originally thought. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex- 
trafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense. Defendant does not explain why sexual 
abuse of a fifteen year old differs in any material way from sexual abuse of a sixteen or 
seventeen year old. All instances involve a minor child, who cannot consent, and who is 


'See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr, at 8:5-10; 13:1-3; 12:17-14:3; 15:1-5; 32:9-16; 34:5-35:1; 
36:2-1. 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page11 of 74 


protected by federal and state laws. The fact remains that Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre while 
she was a minor child for sexual purposes and then proceeded to take her all over the world on 
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet, the “Lolita Express,”” as well as to his various 
residences, and even to her own London house. Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that 
Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre — although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even 
a single one of those flights. Inconsequential details that Ms. Giuffre may have originally 
remembered incorrectly do not render her substantive claims of abuse by Defendant false, much 
less deliberate “lies.” At most, these minor inaccuracies, in the context of a child suffering from 
a troubled childhood and sexual abuse, create nothing more than a fact question on whether 
Defendant’s statement that Ms. Giuffre lied when she accused Defendant of abuse is 
“substantially true,” thereby precluding summary judgment. See Mitre Sports Int’l Ltd. v. Home 
Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 255 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (“Because determining whether COI 
is substantially true would require this court to decide disputed facts ... summary judgment is not 
appropriate”). 

Defendant has tried to spin these inconsequential mistakes of memory into talismanic 
significance and evidence of some form of bad-faith litigation, but this claim fails under the 
weight of the evidence. As the Court knows, the clear weight of the evidence establishes 
Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and 
in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. 
Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein — including 23 


documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly

together. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 103:4-9 (“Q. After that day, do you 
recall that she started coming to the house more frequently. A. Yes, she did. Q. In fact, did she 
start coming to the house approximately three times a week? A. Yes, probably.”). It is also 
undisputed that witnesses deposed in this case have testified about Defendant’s role as a procurer 
of underage girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. At the very least, a trier of fact should 
determine whether the evidence establishes whether or not Ms. Giuffre’s claims of Defendant 
being involved in her trafficking and abuse are true. Defendant’s summary judgment motion 
should be denied in its entirety. 
Il. UNDISPUTED FACTS 
The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted 
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting 
underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come 
over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers. Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a 
minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. 
Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets — the — Lolita Express” — with Defendant at 
least 23 times. 
A. It is an Undisputed Fact That Multiple Witnesses Deposed in This Case Have 

Testified That Defendant Operated as Convicted Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s 

Procurer of Underage Girls. 

1. It is an undisputed fact that Joanna Sjoberg testified Defendant lured 


her from her school to have sex with Epstein under the guise of hiring 
her for a job answering phones. 








Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with 
Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s 
school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a 


legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, 


4 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page13 of 74 


nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and 
made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so 
that Defendant did not have to do it. 


Q. And when did you first meet Ms. Maxwell? 
A. 2001. March probably. End of February/beginning of March. 
Q. And how did you meet her? 
A. She approached me while I was on campus at Palm Beach Atlantic College. 

eR 
Q. And how long did you work in that position answering phones and doing -- 
A. Just that one day. 

eR 
Q. And what happened that second time you came to the house? 
A. At that point, I met Emmy Taylor, and she took me up to Jeffrey’s bathroom and he was 
present. And her and I both massaged Jeffrey. She was showing me how to massage. And 
then she -- he took -- he got off the table, she got on the table. She took off her clothes, got 
on the table, and then he was showing me moves that he liked. And then I took my clothes 
off. They asked me to get on the table so I could feel it. Then they both massaged me. 

2 
Q. Who did Emmy work for? 
2 A. Ghislaine. 
3 Q. Did Maxwell ever refer to Emmy by any particular term? 
5 A. She called her her slave. 

RE 
Q. Did Jeffrey ever tell you why he received so many massages from so many different girls? 
A. He explained to me that, in his opinion, he needed to have three orgasms a day. It was 
biological, like eating. 

eR 
Q. Was there anything you were supposed to do in order to get the camera? 
THE WITNESS: I did not know that there were expectations of me to get the camera until 
after. She [Defendant] had purchased the camera for me, and I was over there giving Jeffrey 
a massage. I did not know that she was in possession of the camera until later. She told me -- 
called me after I had left and said, I have the camera for you, but you cannot receive it yet 
because you came here and didn’t finish your job and I had to finish it for you. 
Q. And did you -- what did you understand her to mean? 
A. She was implying that I did not get Jeffrey off, and so she had to do it. 
Q. And when you say “get Jeffrey off,” do you mean bring him to orgasm? 
A. Yes. 

eR 
Q. Based on what you knew, did Maxwell know that the type of massages Jeffrey was getting 
typically involved sexual acts? 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
Q. What was Maxwell’s main job with respect to Jeffrey? 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page14 of 74 


THE WITNESS: Well, beyond companionship, her job, as it related to me, was to find 
other girls that would perform massages for him and herself. 


Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and 
Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion: 


Q. Tell me how it came to be that there was a picture taken. 

THE WITNESS: I just remember someone suggesting a photo, and they told us to go get on 
the couch. And so Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet, the puppet 
on her lap. And so then I sat on Andrew’s lap, and I believe on my own volition, and they 
took the puppet’s hands and put it on Virginia’s breast, and so Andrew put his on mine.* 


Ms. Sjoberg’s testimony corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s account of how Defendant recruited 
her (and others) under a ruse of a legitimate job in order to bring them into the household to have 
sex with Epstein. Ms. Sjoberg’s testimony also corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s account of being lent 
out to Prince Andrew by Defendant, as even the interaction Ms. Sjoberg witnessed included a 
sexual act: Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to 
touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast. 


2, It is an undisputed fact that Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant 
would call him to bring over underage girls and that Defendant and 
Epstein would have threesomes with Ms. Giuffre.” 


Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with 
Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons: 


Q. Okay. And tell me everything that you remember about what Ms. Roberts said about 
being intimate with Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein at the same time. 

A. [remember her talking about, like, strap-ons and stuff like that. But, I mean, like I said, 
all the details are not really that clear. But I remember her talking about, like, how _ they 
would always be using and stuff like that. 

Q. She and Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein would use strap-ons? 


A. Uh-huh (affirmative). 
ae

36:2-15. 

* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 82:23-83:9. 

° Defendant attempts to discredit Figueroa’s damaging testimony by repeatedly mentioning that he has been 
convicted for a drug-related offense. Unsurprisingly, in this attack, Defendant does not mention that she has a DUI 
conviction. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. at 390:13-15. (April 22, 2016).

Q. Other than sex with the Prince, is there anyone else that Jeffrey wanted Ms. Roberts to 
have sex with that she relayed to you? 
A. Mainly, like I said, just Ms. Maxwell and all the other girls. 
Q. Ms. Maxwell wanted -- Jeffrey wanted Virginia to have sex with Ms. Maxwell? 
A. And him, yeah. 
Q. And did she tell you whether she had ever done that? 
A. Yeah. She said that she did. 
Bet 
Q. And what did she describe having happened? 
A. I believe I already told you that. With the strap-ons and dildos and everything.° 


on eeee—C™SC(‘(‘!CG 
Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for 
Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein: 


Q. [W]hen Ghislaine Maxwell would call you during the time that you were living with 
Virginia, she would ask you what, specifically? 
A. Just if [had found any other girls just to bring to Jeffrey. 
Q. Okay. 
A. Pretty much every time there was a conversation with any of them, it was either asking 
Virginia where she was at, or asking her to get girls, or asking me to get girls. 
eR 
Q. Okay. Well, tell me. When did Ms. Maxwell ask you to bring a girl? 
A. Never in person. It was, like, literally, like, on the phone maybe, like, once or twice. 
Q All right. Did Ms. Maxwell call you frequently? 
A.No. 
Q. All right. How many times do you think Ms. Maxwell called you, at all? 
A. I'd just say that probably a just a few, a couple of times. Maybe once or twice. 
Q. One or two -- 
A. The majority of the time it was pretty much his assistant. 
Q. How do you know Ms. Maxwell’s voice? 
A. Because she sounds British. 
Q. So someone with a British accent called you once or twice and asked for -- 
A. Well, she told me who she was. 
Q. Okay. And what did she say when she called you and asked you to bring girls? 
A. She just said, “Hi. This is Ghislaine. Jeffrey was wondering if you had anybody that could 
come over.”*

3. It is an undisputed fact that Rinaldo Rizzo testified that Defendant 
took the passport of a 15-year-old Swedish girl and threatened her 
when she refused to have sex with Epstein. 


Rinaldo Rizzo was the house manager for one of Defendant’s close friends, Eva Dubin. 
Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears — how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed 
Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl 
tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through 
threats and stealing her passport: 


Q. How old was this girl? 
A. 15 years old. 

Ret 
Q. Describe for me what the girl looked like, including her demeanor and anything else you 
remember about her when she walks into the kitchen. 
A. Very attractive, beautiful young girl. Makeup, very put together, casual dress. But she 
seemed to be upset, maybe distraught, and she was shaking, and as she sat down, she sat 
down and sat in the stool exactly the way the girls that I mentioned to you sat at Jeffrey’s 
house, with no expression and with their head down. But we could tell that she was very 
nervous. 
Q. What do you mean by distraught and shaking, what do you mean by that? 
A. Shaking, I mean literally quivering. 

Bet 
Q. What did she say? 
A. She proceeds to tell my wife and I that, and this is not -- this is blurting out, not a 
conversation like I’m having a casual conversation. That quickly, I was on an island, I was 
on the island and there was Ghislaine, there was Sarah, she said they asked me for sex, I said 
no. And she is just rambling, and I’m like what, and she said -- I asked her, I said what? And 
she says yes, I was on the island, I don’t know how I got from the island to here. Last 
afternoon or in the afternoon I was on the island and now I’m here. And I said do you have a 
-- this is not making any sense to me, and I said this is nuts, do you have a passport, do you 
have a phone? And she says no, and she says Ghislaine took my passport. And I said what, 
and she says Sarah took her passport and her phone and gave it to Ghislaine Maxwell, and at 
that point she said that she was threatened. And I said threatened, she says yes, I was 
threatened by Ghislaine not to discuss this. And I’m just shocked. So the conversation, and 
she is just rambling on and on, again, like I said, how she got here, she doesn’t know how she 
got here. Again, I asked her, did you contact your parents and she says no. At that point, she 
says I’m not supposed to talk about this. I said, but I said: How did you get here. I don’t 
understand. We were totally lost for words. And she said that before she got there, she was 
threatened again by Jeffrey and Ghislaine not to talk about what I had mentioned earlier, 
about -- again, the word she used was sex. 
Q. And during this time that you’re saying she is rambling, is her demeanor continues to be 
what you described it? 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page17 of 74 


A. Yes. 

Q. Was she in fear? 

A. Yes. 

Q. You could tell? 

A. Yes. 

A. She was shaking uncontrollably.” 


4. It is an undisputed fact that Lyn Miller testified that she believed 
Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new mama”. 


Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living 
with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.”!° Incredulously, Defendant 


testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.'! 


5. It is an undisputed Fact that Detective Joseph Recarey testified that 
he sought to investigate Defendant in relation to his investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. 


Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that 
Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his 
investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer: 


Q. A cross-reference of Jeffrey Epstein’s residence revealed which affiliated names? 
A. It revealed Nadia Marcinkova, Ghislane Maxwell, Mark Epstein. Also, the cross- 
reference, any previous reports from the residence as well. 
Q. During your investigation, did you learn of any involvement that Nadia Marcinkova had 
with any of the activities you were investigating? 

cet 
Q. The other name that is on here as a cross-reference is Ghislane Maxwell. Did you speak 
with Ghislane Maxwell? 
A. I did not. 
Q. Did you ever attempt to speak with Ghislane Maxwell? 
A. I wanted to speak with everyone related to this home, including Ms. Maxwell. My contact 
was through Gus, Attorney Gus Fronstin, at the time, who initially had told me that he would 
make everyone available for an interview. And subsequent conversations later, no one was 
available for interview and everybody had an attorney, and I was not going to be able to 
speak with them. 
Q. Okay. During your investigation, what did you learn in terms of Ghislane Maxwell’s 
involvement, if any?

THE WITNESS: Ms. Maxwell, during her research, was found to be Epstein’s long-time 
friend. During the interviews, Ms. Maxwell was involved in seeking girls to perform 
massages and work at Epstein’s home.” 


6. It is an undisputed fact that Pilot David Rodgers testified that he flew 
Defendant and Ms. Giuffre at least 23 times on Epstein’s jet, the 


“Lolita Express” and that “GM” on the flight logs Stands for 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 


Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. 
Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.'* However, David Rodgers, 
Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials - GM — was, 
in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant 
flew with Plaintiff.'* The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on 


many of them when she flew with Defendant. ° 


7. It is an undisputed fact that Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, and 
Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about 
Defendant trafficking girls for Jeffery Epstein. 


Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. 
They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in 
recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein. Marcinkova testified as follows: 


Q. Did Ghislaine Maxwell work as a recruiter of young girls for Jeffrey Epstein when 
you met her? 
A. Same answer. [Invocation of Fifth Amendment] 

ke 
Q. Have you observed Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein convert what started as 
a massage with these young girls into something sexual? 
A. Same answer.'®

8. It is an undisputed fact that Juan Alessi testified that Defendant was 
one of the people who procured some of the over 100 girls he 
witnessed visit Epstein, and that he had to clean Defendant’s sex toys. 











Juan Alessi was Epstein’s house manager. He testified as follows: 


Q. And over the course of that 10-year period of time while Ms. Maxwell was at the house, 
do you have an approximation as to the number of different females — females that you were 
told were massage therapists that came to house?

Q. Did you have occasion to clean up after the massages? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. And that is after both a massage for Jeffrey Epstein, as well as clean up after a 
massage that Ghislaine Maxwell may have received? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And on occasion, after -- in cleaning up after a massage of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine 
Maxwell, did you have occasion to find vibrators or sex toys that would be left out? 

A. yes, I did.” 

9. It is an undisputed fact that Defendant was unable to garner a single 
witness throughout discovery who can testify that she did not act as 
the procurer of underage girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. 

Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one — to testify that 
Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex. Even one of her 
own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex. 
Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s 
“new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in 
Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have 
testified that she was Epstein’s procuress. Others who lived with her — Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia 
Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen — invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on 
the same. No one has testified to the contrary. 

B. Documentary Evidence also Shows that Defendant Trafficked Ms. Giuffre 

and Procured her for Sex with Convicted Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein while 


She Was Underage. 


1. The Flight Logs 


Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why 
she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 
international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world. Her motion for

summary judgment — as well as all previous briefing papers — are absolutely silent on those 
damning documents. 
2. The Photographs 

Throughout a mountain of briefing and, and even in her own deposition testimony, 
Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, 
and Epstein. She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed 
with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with 
Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London. This particular photograph corroborates Ms. 
Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be 
in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now- 


: 20 
convicted sex offender. 





Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with 





Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein:*!

warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be pre- 


pubescent (Ms. Giuffre will only submit its redacted form):”° 





3. The Victim Identification Letter 
In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified 
Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. 


Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.*4 
Re: Jeffrey Epstein/ ____ NOTIFICATION OF 
IDENTIFIED VICTIM 
Dear 


By virtue of this letter, the United States Attomey’s Office for the Southern District 
of Florida provides you with the following notice because you are an identified victim of a 
federal offense. 


4, New York Presbyterian Hospital Records 


Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical 
records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre 


produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both

Defendant and Epstein taking Plaintiff to New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York while 
she was a minor.”* The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old. 
5. Judith Lightfoot Psychological Records 

As the Court is aware, Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production 
concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and 
vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records ina 
fanfare of unnecessary motion practice. See, e.g., Defendant’s Motion to Compel (DE 75); 
Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions at 10 (“Ms. Maxwell has been severely prejudiced by 
Plaintiff's failure to provide the required identifying information and documents from her health 
care providers.”). Ms. Giuffre and her counsel took on the considerable burden and significant 
expense of retrieving and producing over 250 pages of medical records from over 20 providers, 
spanning two continents and nearly two decades. 

Now that those records have been collected, Defendant’s 68 page motion makes no 
reference to a single medical record produced by Ms. Giuffre, nor a single provider, nor a single 
treatment, nor or a single medication prescribed. After Defendant’s repeated motion practice 
stressing the essentiality of these records, this may surprise the Court. But not Ms. Giuffre. 
Defendant’s requests unearthed documents that are highly unfavorable to Defendant that 
corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s claims against her. 

Years before this cause of action arose, Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a 
psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and 
Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, 


unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser: 


* See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 33, GIUFFRE003259-003290. 
16 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page25 of 74 


. .. [Ms. Giuffre] was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell who said she could help 

her get a job as a massage therapist . . . seemed respectable . . . was shown how to 

massage, etc., Geoff [sic] Epstein. Told to undress and perform sexual acts on 

person. Miss Maxwell promised her $200 a job.° 

Therefore, years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating 
psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein. 

6. Message Pads 

Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his 
associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, 
including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.2” These were collected both from trash 
pulls from the residence and during the execution of the search warrant where the pads were 
found laying out in the open in the residence.”* The search warrant was executed in 2005 and the 
message pads collected include messages recorded in 2004 and 2005. Numerous witnesses have 
described that these copies of collected messages accurately reflect those taken by various staff 
at the Palm Beach Epstein mansion between 2004 and 2005.” 

The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of 
minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during 
relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events. 

While there were hundreds of these messages recovered during the investigation, this 
small sample demonstrates the undeniable reality that there exists a genuine issue of material fact 
with respect to Defendant’s involvement in and knowledge of the activities described by Giuffre 
which Maxwell has said we “untrue” and “obvious lies.”

17 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page26 of 74 


This sampling reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including 
from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein. This 
demonstrates that Maxwell was at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion in 2004 and 2005, incidentally 
a time period she has denied being around the house in her deposition. See supra 
GIUFFRE001412; 001435; 001449. The messages also reveal that multiple “girls” were leaving 
messages that were being taken and memorialized and left out in the open for anyone to see. 
Certain messages also make clear that a number of these “girls” were in school. In addition to 
taking messages herself (and the staff working under her direction taking these relevant 
messages), staff employees were taking and leaving messages for Defendant. This is evidence 
that Maxwell was in the house at relevant times, including times that she has now testified under 
oath that she was not there. Other messages demonstrate Epstein and Maxwell’s friends, 
including Jean Luc Brunel, leaving messages relating to underage females. The following is a 


small sampling of such messages:

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 


The following are descriptions of a sampling of messages pads*” that create a genuine dispute 


of material fact: 


One message pad reflects a who is identified in the Palm Beach Police 
Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not 
have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s 
sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages. (See GIUFFRE05660 (“She stated she 
was called by Sara for her to return to work for Epstein stated ‘work’ is the term 
used by Sarah to provide the massage in underwear.”). Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year 
to JE from am) ”T need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some 
work for me?” 








Other message pads reflect J who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at 
the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The 
second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled 
every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the 
home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the 
lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at 
least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as 
Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or 
aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe. 

Giuffre 001428 — undated Jeffrey From - “Has girl for toni ht” ;Giuffre 


001432 (pictured above)— 7/9/04 — Mr. Epstein From is available 
on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 TTT04 = Mr. Epstein from 
— “Me and can come tomorrow any time or FBalone” ; ; Giuffre — 


001452 — undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.” 


Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young 
females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis. 
Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)— JE from “N” — ‘ hasn’t confirmed 

for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; 
Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed _ at 4 pm. Who is 
scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.” 







This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year 
old Russian girl for purposes of sex. Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For 
Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak 
Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 
1st today if you call.” 


This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present 
during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows 
leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 


*” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. 


20 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 


with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a 
fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, 
it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she 
claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and 
messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion. Giuffre 001412 — 9/10/05 
(during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from — “I went to 
Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.” 


These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was 
in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For 
example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach 
mansion so frequently that people, including Epstein’s main pilot Larry Visoski, are 
leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house. Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 — Mr. 
Epstein from Ms. Maxwell — “tell him to call me”; Giuffre — 001449 — 8/22/05 — JE 
from GM; Giuffre — 001453 — 4/25/04 for Ms. Maxwell From Larry “returning your 
call”; 


This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s 
life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion. Giuffre — 001454 — undated Jeffrey 
From Ghislaine — “Would be helpful to have come to Palm Beach 
today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.” 


This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of 
the name) leaving a message asking if she can come to the house at a later time because 
she needs to “stay in school.” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)— Jeffrey 2/28/05 
Redacted name “She is wondering if 2:30 is o.k. She needs to stay in school.”

It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal 
friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. 
Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed 
a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI. This document reflects the 
numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers. Additionally, 
and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical 
designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers 
included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) — including 
fF identified during the criminal investigation of 
Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with 
Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the 
contents of the document.

This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually 
exploited by Defendant and Epstein — not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm 
Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 
2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence 
contradicts that testimony. 


9. Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number 





Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein 
had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch. Defendant told Virginia 
she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and 
Defendant. Indeed, on the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote 
on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to 
check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell 
O) i”: on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard 
copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit

10. It is undisputed fact that the FBI report and the Churcher emails 
reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince 
Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument 
that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.

See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 34, GIUFFRE003678. Accordingly, there is documentary 
evidence that refutes Defendant’s meritless argument that Ms. Giuffre did not allege she had sex 
with Prince Andrew until 2014. To the contrary, two sources, including the FBI, show Ms. 
Giuffre made these claims in 2011. 


Cc. Defendant Has Produced No Documents Whatsoever That Tend to Show 
That She Did Not Procure Underage Girls For Jeffrey Epstein. 


Defendant has produced no documents that even tend to show that she did not procure 
underage girls for sex with Epstein, and no documents that tend to show that she did not 
participate in the abuse. Indeed, Defendant refused to produce any documents dated prior to 
2009, which includes the 2000-2002 period during which she abused Ms. Giuffre. 

Against this backdrop of an avalanche of evidence showing the Defendant sexually 
trafficked Ms. Giuffre, summary judgment on any of the issues advanced by Defen dant is 
inappropriate. While we discuss the particulars of the individual claims below, the larger picture 
is important too. Ms. Giuffre will prove at trial that Epstein and Defendant sexually trafficked 
her. And yet, when Ms. Giuffre had the courage to come forward and expose what Defendant 
had done to world — in a Court pleading trying to hold Epstein accountable — Defendant 


26 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page35 of 74 


responded by calling her a liar in a press release intended for worldwide publication. Such 
heinous conduct is not a mere “opinion,” but rather is defamation executed deliberately and with 
actual malice. The jury should hear all of the evidence and then render its verdict on Ms. 
Giuffre’s complaint. 
Ill. LEGAL STANDARD 

Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a motion for summary 
judgment may be granted only when “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that 
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” The Second Circuit has repeatedly 
held that “all ambiguities and inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts should be 
resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine 
issue for trial should be resolved against the moving party.” Swan Brewery Co. Ltd. v. U.S. Trust 
Co. of New York, 832 F. Supp. 714, 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (Sweet, J.), citing Brady v. Town of 
Colchester, 863 F.2d 205, 210 (2d Cir. 1988) (internal quotations omitted). In other words, in 
deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must construe the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-moving party’s 
favor. In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 517 F.3d 76, 87 (2d Cir. 2008). Stern v. Cosby, 
645 F. Supp. 2d 258, 269 (S.D.N.Y.2009). Summary judgment should be denied “if the evidence 
is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict” in favor of the non-moving party. See Net 
Jets Aviation, Inc. v. LHC Commc’ns, LLC, 537 F.3d 168, 178-79 (2d Cir. 2008). 
IV. LEGAL ARGUMENT 


A. Defendant is Liable for the Publication of the Defamatory Statement and 
Damages for Its Publication 


Defendant’s lead argument is that, when she issued a press release attacking Ms. Giuffre 


to members of the media, she somehow is not responsible when the media quickly published her 


27 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page36 of 74 


attacks. If accepted, this remarkable claim would eviscerate defamation law, as it would permit a 
defamer to send defamatory statements to the media and then stand back and watch — immune 
from liability — when (as in this case) the defamatory statements are published around the world. 
This absurd position is not the law, particularly given that the Defendant released a statement to 
media asking them to “[p]lease find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.” 

To make her claim seem plausible, Defendant cites older cases, some dating back as far 
as 1906. This presents a distorted picture of the case law on these issues. As a leading authority 
on defamation explains with regard to liability for republication by another of statement by a 
defendant: “Two standards have evolved. The older one is that the person making the defamatory 
statement is liable for republication only if it occurs with his or her express or implied 
authorization of consent. The more modern formulation adds responsibility for all republication 
that can reasonably be anticipated or that is the ‘natural and probable consequence’ of the 
publication.” SACK ON DEFAMATION § 2.7.2 at 2-113 to 2-114 (4th ed. 2016). In this case, 
however, the nuances of the applicable legal standards make little difference because Defendant 
so clearly authorized — indeed, desired and did everything possible to obtain — publication of her 
defamatory statements attacking Ms. Giuffre. 


1. Under New York Law, Defendant is liable for the media’s publication 
of her press release. 





Given the obvious purposes of defamation law, New York law unsurprisingly assigns 
liability to individuals for the media’s publication of press releases. Indeed, New York appellate 
courts have repeatedly held that an individual is liable for the media publishing that individual’s 
defamatory press release. See Levy v. Smith, 18 N.Y.S.3d 438, 439, 132 A.D.3sd 961, 962-63 
(N.Y.A.D. 2 Dept. 2015) (Generally, [o]ne who makes a defamatory statement is not 


responsible for its recommunication without his authority or request by another over whom he 


28 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page37 of 74 


has no control . . . Here, however . . . the appellant intended and authorized the republication of 
the allegedly defamatory content of the press releases in the news articles”); National Puerto 
Rican Day Parade, Inc. v. Casa Publications, Inc., 914 N.Y.S.2d 120, 123, 79 A.D.3d 592, 595 
(N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept. 2010) (affirming the refusal to dismiss defamation counts against a defendant 
who “submitted an open letter that was published in [a] newspaper, and that [the defendant] paid 
to have the open letter published,” and finding that the defendant “authorized [the newspaper] to 
recommunicate his statements.”) See also RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 576 (1977) (“The 
publication of a libel or slander is a legal cause of any special harm resulting from its repetition 
by a third person if. . . the repetition was authorized or intended by the original defamer, or . . . 
the repetition was reasonably to be expected.”)** 

Defendant deliberately sent her defamatory statement to major news media publishers for 
worldwide circulation because Defendant wanted the public at large to believe that Ms. Giuffre 
was lying about her abuse. Defendant even hired a public relations media specialist to ensure the 
media would publish her statement. Her efforts succeeded: her public relations agent instructed 
dozens of media outlets to publish her “quotable” defamatory statement and they did. 

Despite this deliberate campaign to widely publicize her defamatory statement, 
Defendant now disclaims any responsibility for the media publishing her press release. If we 
understand Defendant’s position correctly, because she somehow lacked “control” over what 
major newspapers and other media finally put in their stories, she escapes liability for 
defamation. This nonsensical position would let a defamer send a false and defamatory letter to 


major media, and then, when they published the accusation, escape any liability. Such an 


MCf, Eliah v. Ucatan Corp., 433 F. Supp. 309, 312-13 (W.D.N.Y. 1977) (“The alleged multistate publication of 
plaintiff's photograph without her consent thus gives rise to a single cause of action. ... However, evidence of the 
multistate publication of the magazine and the number of copies sold would be competent and pertinent to a 
showing of damages, if any, suffered by plaintiff.”) 





29 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page38 of 74 


argument is not only an affront to logic, but it is contrary to prevailing New York case law, cited 
above. Perhaps even more important, in the context of the pending summary judgment motion, it 
would require Defendant to convince the jury that she did not “authorize or intend” for the major 
media to publish her press release. Obviously the disputed facts on this point are legion, and 
summary judgment is accordingly inappropriate. 
Even the cases Defendant cites contradict her argument. She first cites Geraci v. Probst, 

in which a defendant sent a letter to the Board of Fire Commissioners, and, years later, a 
newspaper published the letter. The court held that the defendant was not liable for that belated 
publication, “made years later without his knowledge or participation.” /d., at 340. By contrast, 
Defendant not only authorized the defamatory statement, but paid money to her publicist to 
convince media outlets to publish it promptly — actions taken with both her knowledge and 
consent. Defendant’s statement was thus not published “without [her] authority or request,” as in 
Geraci, but by her express authority and by her express request. Defendant’s publicist’s 
testimony and the documents produced by Defendant’s publicist unambiguously establish that 
the media published her press release with Defendant’s authority and by her request: 

Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell’s retention of your 


services? 
A. Yes, I was 
ae 

Q. The subject line does have “FW” which to me indicates it’s a forward. Do you know 
where the rest of this email chain is? 
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not 
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by Ms. 
Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action. I 
therefore respond, “Okay, Ghislaine, I'll go with this.” 

It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the second 
one is “Urgent, this is the statement” so J take that as an instruction to send it out, as a 
positive command: “This is the statement.”*° 


* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 44:6-45:13 (emphasis added). 
30 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page39 of 74 


Similarly, another case cited by Defendant, Davis v. Costa-Gavras, involved a libel claim 
against a book author who wrote an account of the 1972 military coup in Chile. Years later, the 
plaintiff attempted to ascribe defamation liability to a third-party publishing house’s decision to 
republish the book in paperback form and a third-party filmmaker who released a movie based 
on the book. The Court held that a “party who is ‘innocent of all complicity’ in the publication of 
a libel cannot be held accountable . . . [but that] a deliberate decision to republish or active 
participation in implementing the republication resurrects the liability.” 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1094 
(S.D.N.Y. 1984). Here, Defendant made a deliberate decision to publish her press release, and 
actively participated in that process. At the very least, the jury must make a determination of 
whether Defendant was “innocent of all complicity” for a libelous statement contained in her 
press release. 

Finally, Defendant cites Karaduman v. Newsday, Inc., 416 N.E.2d 557 (1980), which 
held that reporters of a series of articles on narcotics trade “cannot be held personally liable for 
injuries arising from its subsequent republication in book form absent a showing that they 
approved or participated in some other manner in the activities of the third-party republisher.” 
Id., 416 N.E.2d at 559-560. Again, the jury could reasonably find that Defendant both approved 
of, and even participated in, the media’s publication of her press release. Indeed, it is hard to 
understand how any jury could find anything else. Defendant was obviously “active” in 
influencing the media to publish her defamatory press release, she both “approved” of and 


pushed for the publication of the press release. Accordingly, she is liable for its publication.*° 


*° On page 14 of her motion, Defendant makes wholly contradictory statements. In back-to-back sentences, she tells 
the Court that (1) she has no control over whether the media published the statement she sent to the media (with 
instructions to publish it by an influential publicist); (2) her public relations representative gave instructions to the 
media on how to publish it (in full); and (3) her public relations representative “made no effort to control” how the 
media would publish it. Indeed, the best evidence of Defendant’s control over the press is the fact dozens of media 
outlets obeyed her directive to publish her defamatory statement. 


31 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page40 of 74 


Therefore, disclaiming responsibility for the media’s publication of a statement (for which she 
hired a publicist for the purpose of influencing the media to publish that statement) is contrary to 


both prevailing case law, and the cases cited by Defendant. 


2. Defendant is liable for the media’s publication of the defamatory 
statement. 


After arguing, contrary to New York law, that she is not liable for the media’s publication 
of her own press release, Defendant next argues that she is not liable for the media’s publications 
of the defamatory statement contained within her press release if the media chose to make even 
the tiniest of editorial changes. If we understand Defendant’s argument correctly, any omission 
of any language from a press release is somehow a “selective, partial” publication for which she 
escapes liability. Mot. at 14. Once again, this claim is absurd on its face. It would mean that a 
defamer could send to the media a long attack on a victim with one irrelevant sentence and, when 
the media quite predictably cut that sentence, escape liability for the attack. Moreover, even on 
its face, the claim presents a jury question of what changes would be, in context, viewed as 
“selective” or “partial” publications — something that only a jury could determine after hearing 
all of the evidence. 

In support of this meritless argument, Defendant cites Rand v. New York Times Co., for 


the proposition that a defendant cannot be liable for a publisher’s “editing and excerpting of her 
statement.” 430 N.Y.S.2d 271, 274, 75 A.D.2d 417, 422 (N.Y.A.D. 1980). This argument fails 
for several reasons. First, there is no “republication” by the media as a matter of law. Defendant 
issued a defamatory statement to the press, and its publication (as Defendant intended) is not a 
“republication” under the law, as discussed above. Second, there was no “editing” or 


paraphrasing or taking the quote out of context of the core defamatory statement in the press 


release: that Ms. Giuffre is a liar. The “obvious lies” passage is the heart of the message 


32 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page41 of 74 


Defendant sent to the press: that Ms. Giuffre was lying about her past sexual abuse. Even in 
isolation, Defendant’s quote stating that Ms. Giuffre’s claims are “obvious lies” does not distort 
or misrepresent the message Defendant intended to convey to the public that Ms. Giuffre was 
lying about her claims. As this Court explained in denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, this 
case “involves statements that explicitly claim the sexual assault allegations are false.” Giuffire v. 
Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). 

Furthermore, the facts at issue here make the Rand holding inapposite. In Rand, a 
newspaper paraphrased and “sanitized” defendant’s words. No such changing, sanitizing, or 
paraphrasing occurred in the instant case: the media quoted Defendant’s statement accurately. 
Further, the phrase at issue in Rand was that certain people “screwed” another person. The 
speaker/newspaper used the term “screwed” in reference to a record label’s dealings with a 
performing artist, and not did not mean “screwed” in the literal sense, but as “rhetorical 
hyperbole, and as such, is not to be taken literally.” Jd. By contrast, there is no hyperbole in 
Defendant’s defamatory statement, and it was never distorted or paraphrased by any publication 
known to Ms. Giuffre. A jury could reasonable conclude that Defendant’s statement that Ms. 
Giuffre’s claims of child sexual abuse are “obvious lies” is not a rhetorical device, nor 
hyperbole, but a literal and particular affirmation that Ms. Giuffre lied. 

Accordingly, there is no support in the factual record that the media reporting that 
Defendant stated that Ms. Giuffre’s claims of childhood sexual abuse are “obvious lies” is a 
distortion of Defendant’s message or hyperbole. Even a cursory review of the press release 
would lead to that conclusion. Moreover, to the extent that there is any dispute that Defendant’s 


statement had a different meaning outside of the context of the remainder of the press release, 


33 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page42 of 74 


such a determination of meaning and interpretation is a question of fact for the jury to decide, 
and is inappropriate for a determination upon summary judgment. 


B. Material Issues of Fact Preclude Summary Judgment. 


1. The Barden Declaration presents disputed issues of fact. 


The primary basis of Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is her attorney’s self- 
serving, post hoc affidavit wherein he sets forth his alleged “intent” with regard Defendant’s 
defamatory statement.*” Ms. Giuffre disputes Defendant’s attorney’s alleged and unproven 
“intent” (not to mention Defendant’s “intent”), not only because Defendant refuses to turn over 
her attorney’s communications, but also because questions of intent are questions of fact to be 
determined by a trier of fact. Furthermore, ample record evidence contradicts the claimed 
“intent.” 


a. The Barden Declaration is a deceptive back-door attempt to inject 
Barden’s advice without providing discovery of all attorney 
communications. 


In her brief, Defendant discloses her attorney’s alleged legal strategy and alleged legal 
advice; however, she deliberately states that her attorney “intended,” instead of her attorney 


“advised,” when discussing her attorney’s legal strategy and advice, using that phrase at least 37 


9939 ce, 1740 ce, ol 


times,** and using phrases such as Barden’s “beliefs, purposes, ‘goals,””” and 


>” The Barden declaration is problematic for other reasons as well. In addition to Defendant’s over-length, 68-page 
motion and among Defendant’s 654 pages of exhibits lies an eight-page attorney affidavit that proffers legal 
conclusions and arguments. This exhibit is yet another improper attempt to circumvent this Court’s rules on page 
limits. See Pacenza v. IBM Corp., 363 F. App'x 128, 130 (2d Cir. 2010) (affirming lower court decision to strike 
“documents submitted . . . in support of his summary judgment motion [that] included legal conclusions and 
arguments” because those “extraneous arguments constituted an attempt . . . to circumvent page-limit requirements 
submitted to the court.”); cf, HB v. Monroe Woodbury Cent. School Dist., 2012 WL 4477552, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 
27, 2012) (“The device of incorporating an affirmation into a brief by reference, as Plaintiffs have done here, in 
order to evade the twenty-five page limit, rather obviously defeats the purpose of the rule”). The court should

“contemplations” 25 other times. All the while Defendant has claimed a privilege as to her 
communications with Barden. Defendant attempts to convince the Court that she only granted 
Gow permission to publish the defamatory statement as part of “Mr. Barden’s deliberated and 
carefully crafted” (MSJ at 16) legal strategy and advice. Yet, she still refused to turn over her 
communications with Barden under the auspices of attorney-client privilege.” Such 
gamesmanship should not be permitted. 

If the Court were to consider the Barden Declaration (which it shouldn’t), it would be 
ruling on a less than complete record because, based on this Declaration, it is necessary that 
Defendant disclose all communications with him and possibly others. Ms. Giuffre doesn’t have 
those communications, the court doesn’t have those communications; therefore, Defendant is 
asking for summary judgment on an incomplete record. 

The Court should also not consider the Barden Declaration because it will be 
inadmissible as unduly prejudicial. It is a self-serving declaration by a non-deposed witness 
made without turning over the documents that are relevant to the declaration. See, e.g., Rubens v. 
Mason, 387 F.3d 183, 185 (2d Cir. 2004) (“We find that the District Court predicated its grant of 
summary judgment as to liability on an affidavit from the arbitrator who presided over the 
underlying arbitration, the probative value of which was substantially outweighed by the danger 
of unfair prejudice. The affidavit, therefore should not have been admitted. We therefore vacate 
the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on liability and remand to the District Court.”). 


b. Defendant’s summary judgment argument requires factual findings 
regarding Barden’s intent, thereby precluding summary judgment. 








Even were the Court to consider this Declaration and representations therein — which it 


should not — the declaration itself demonstrates that the Court would have to make factual

finding as to what Mr. Barden’s intent really was. Finding about intent are inappropriate at the 
summary judgment stage, as this Court and the Second Circuit have recognized. This Court has 
explained, “if it is necessary to resolve inferences regarding intent, summary judgment is not 
appropriate.” Id. (Sweet, J.) (emphasis added), citing Patrick v. Le Fevre, 745 F.2d 153, 159 (2d 
Cir. 1984); Friedman v. Meyers, 482 F.2d 435, 439 (2d Cir. 1973) (other citations omitted). 


G. There are factual disputes regarding Barden’s Declaration. 





Finally, there are material disputes over the statements in the Barden Declaration because 
they are directly refuted by record evidence. For example, the instant motion and the Barden 
Declaration describe the press release merely as a document expressing “his [Mr. Bardent’s] 
opinion — in the form of a legal argument —as a lawyer would be,” as opposed to a press release 
for dissemination by the media to the public. Record evidence refutes this claim, as (1) the press 
release was sent to journalists, not media publishers or in-house counsel; (2) the press release 
instructed the journalists to publish the defamatory statement (“Please find attached a quotable 
statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell”); (3) it was issued by a publicist on Defendant’s behalf and 
not by an attorney, without any reference to attorneys or laws — indeed, Gow testified that 
Barden was unavailable to approve the statement; and (4) Gow testified that he issued the 
statement only after he understood Defendant to have “signed off” it, an understanding he 
formed based on Defendant's “positive command” to him: “This is the agreed statement.” 

Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell’s retention of your 


services? 
A. Yes, I was. 

eR 
Q. When you say “agreed statement” can you tell me more about what you mean? Who 
agreed to the statement? 
A. Ineed to give you some context, if I may, about that statement. So, this is on New Year’s 
Day. I was in France so the email time here of 21:46, in French time was 22:46, and I was 
getting up early the next morning to drive my family back from the south of France to 
England, which is a 14-hour journey, door to door. So on the morning of th® 2nd of January, 


36 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page45 of 74 


bearing in mind that Ms. Maxwell, I think was in New York then, she was five hours behind, 
so there was quite a lot of, sort of time difference between the various countries here, I sent 
her an email, I believe, saying - parsing this-- forwarding this email to her saying “How do 
you wish to proceed?” And then I was on the telephone-- I had two telephones in the car, I 
received in excess of 30 phone calls from various media outlets on th° 2nd of January, all 
asking for information about how Ms. Maxwell was looking to respond to the latest court 
filings, which were filed on the 30th of December as I understand. 
And by close-- towards close of play on the 2nd, I received an email forwarded by 
Ms. Maxwell, containing a draft statement which my understanding was the majority of 
which had been drafted by Mr. Barden with a header along the lines of “This is the agreed 
statement.”: At close of play on th® 2nd. So—I was—I had gone under the Channel Tunnel and 
I was sitting on the other side and that email, which my understanding was that it had been 
signed off by the client, effectively, was then sent out to a number of media, including Mr. 
Ball and various other UK newspapers. 
Q. Mr. Gow, when you say “end of play” and “close of play,” are you referring to sending 
the email that is Exhibit 2? 
A. Yes, lam 
ae 

Q. The subject line does have “FW” which to me indicates it’s a forward. Do you know 
where the rest of this email chain is? 
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not 
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by Ms. 
Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action. 
I therefore respond, “Okay, Ghislaine, I’ll go with this.” 

It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the 
second one is “Urgent, this is the statement” so I take that as an instruction to send it 
out, as a positive command: “This is the statement.”* 


Accordingly, record evidence shows that the press release was intended as press release, 
and not as a “legal argument.” Record evidence also establishes that Defendant circulated the 
press release to Barden and Gow, and then gave a “positive command” to Gow to publish it. 
Additionally, there is no indicia that the press release is a legal opinion. To the contrary, it was 
issued by, and specifically attributed to, a woman who has personal knowledge of whether Ms. 
Giuffre’s claims of sexual abuse are true, and she states that Ms. Giuffre is a liar.“ At the very 


least, all of these factual issues must be considered by a jury. 


® See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 31:19-33:7; 44:6-45:13 (emphasis added). 
Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites no case law to support her argument that her attorney’s alleged influence in 
preparing the statement Defendant issued to the media somehow shields her from liability. 


37 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page46 of 74 


Another example is that Defendant states that “Gow served only as Mr. Barden’s conduit 
to the media” (MTD at 25), and “Mr. Barden was directing the January 2-15 statement to a 
discrete number of media representatives.” Barden wasn’t directing anything — he wasn’t even in 
the loop when Defendant decided to publish the statement - and the documents prove it. Indeed, 
the press release itself states that it is “on behalf of Ms. Maxwell,” not Barden, and it was 
Defendant who gave the “positive command” to Gow to publish it. These are just a couple of 
examples, among many, of the purported facts asserted in Defendant’s motion and Barden’s 
Declaration that are directly refuted by facts in the record. 

Finally, neither the media nor the general public could have known that the statement 
should be attributed to Barden. His name was nowhere in it, nor is there any reference to counsel. 
Defendant’s argument that the “context” is the media knowing Barden’s intent or involvement is 
unsupported by the record. The significant factual disputes about Barden, alone, prevent 
summary judgment. 

Cc. Defendant’s Defamatory Statement Was Not Opinion as a Matter of Law. 

As this Court previously held, correctly, Defendant stating that Ms. Giuffre’s claims of 
sexual assault are lies is not an expression of opinion: 

“First, statements that Giuffre’s claims ‘against [Defendant] are untrue,’ have 

been ‘shown to be untrue,’ and are ‘obvious lies’ have a specific and readily 

understood factual meaning: that Giuffre is not telling the truth about her history 

of sexual abuse and Defendant’s role, and that some verifiable investigation has 

occurred and come to a definitive conclusion proving that fact. Second, these 

statements (as they themselves allege), are capable of being proven true or false, 

and therefore constitute actionable fact and not opinion. Third, in their full 

context, while Defendant’s statements have the effect of generally denying 

Plaintiff's story, they also clearly constitute fact to the reader.” 


Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). This Court further explained: 


“Plaintiff cannot be making claims shown to be untrue that are obvious lies 
without being a liar. Furthermore, to suggest an individual is not telling the truth 


38 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page47 of 74 


about her history of having been sexually assaulted as a minor constitutes more 

than a general denial, it alleges something deeply disturbing about the character of 

an individual willing to be publicly dishonest about such a reprehensible crime. 

Defendant’s statements clearly imply that the denials are based on facts separate 

and contradictory to those that Plaintiff has alleged.” Jd. 

Defendant argues that somehow the “context” of the entire statement “tested against the 
understanding of the average reader” should be the press release as a whole being read only by 
journalists. This is an unreasonable construct because the ultimate audience for a press release is 
the public. Indeed, the purpose of a press release is to reach readers. Unsurprisingly, Defendant 
cites no case that holds that journalists might somehow believe statements of fact are opinion 
while others do not. 

This Court has previously covered this ground when it clearly stated: 

Sexual assault of a minor is a clear-cut issue; either transgression occurred or it 

did not. Either Maxwell was involved or she was not. The issue is not a matter of 

opinion, and there cannot be differing understandings of the same facts that justify 

diametrically opposed opinion as to whether Defendant was involved in Plaintiffs 
abuse as Plaintiff has claimed. Either Plaintiff is telling the truth about her story 

and Defendant’s involvement, or Defendant is telling the truth and she was not 

involved in the trafficking and ultimate abuse of Plaintiff. 

Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp.at 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The same conclusion applies now. At 
the motion to dismiss stage, Defendant had not yet produced the statement she issued to the 
press. That statement is now in evidence, so there is no ambiguity as to what defendant released 
to the press. 

The absurdity of Defendant characterizing his statements calling Ms. Giuffre a liar as 
mere “opinion” is revealed by the fact that Defendant was the one who was sexually trafficking 
and otherwise abusing Ms. Giuffre. No reasonable person in any context would construe that as 


Defendant’s mere “opinion” on the subject, since Defendant knew she was abusing Ms. Giuffre. 


Indeed, this argument is contradicted by Defendant’s own deposition testimony: 


39 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page48 of 74 


Q. Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors? 
A. I can only testify to what I know. I know that Virginia is a liar and I know what 
she testified is a lie. So I can only testify to what I know to be a falsehood and half 
those falsehoods are enormous and so I can only categorically deny everything she 
has said and that is the only thing I can talk about because I have no knowledge of 
anything else. 
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. (April 17, 2016) at 174:6-19. 
Defendant slyly contends in her motion that “Mr. Barden’s “arguments” in the press release 


constitute ‘pure opinion,” attempting to disclaim any involvement in making the defamatory 
statement. However, it is not Mr. Barden’s statement, nor his opinion, that it at issue here. At 
issue here is Defendant’s statement — a statement attributable to her, that she approved, whose 
publication she “command{ed],” and for which she hired a public relations representative to 
disseminate to at least 30 journalists for publication. While Mr. Barden could possibly have had 
his own opinion as to whether or not his client abused Ms. Giuffre, Defendant cannot express an 
opinion on a binary, yes/no subject where she knows the truth. As this Court previously 
articulated, “statements that Giuffre’s claims ‘against [defendant] are untrue,’ have been ‘shown 
to be untrue,’ and are ‘obvious lies’ have a specific and readily understood factual meaning.” 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 152. Again, at the very least, the jury must pass on such 
issues. 


D. The Pre-Litigation Privilege Does Not Apply to Defendant’s Press Release 


1. Defendant fails to make a showing that the pre-litigation privilege 
applies. 


Defendant’s next argument seeks refuge in the pre-litigation privilege. If we understand the 
argument correctly, Defendant seems to be saying that because she was contemplating an 
(unspecified and never-filed) lawsuit involving the British Press, she somehow had a “green 


light” to make whatever defamatory statements she wanted about Ms. Giuffre. To prove such a 


40 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page49 of 74 


remarkably claim, Defendant relies on caselaw involving such mundane topics as “cease and 
desist” letters sent to opposing parties and the like. Obviously such arguments have no 
application to the press release that Defendant sent out, worldwide, attacking Ms. Giuffre’s 
veracity. 

The problems with the Defendant’s argument are legion. For starters, there is no record 
evidence — not even Defendant’s own testimony — suggesting that she was contemplating 
litigation against Ms. Giuffre, or that her press release was related to contemplated litigation 
against Ms. Giuffre. Tellingly, the only “evidence” Defendant cites of any alleged contemplated 
litigation is the self-serving, post hoc, partial waiver of attorney-client privilege found in the 
Barden Declaration. As discussed above, that Declaration fails to establish that there was good 
faith anticipated litigation between her and Ms. Giuffre, particularly when evidence in the record 
contradicts such assertions. At the very least, it is a matter of fact for the jury to decide. 

In another case in which a defendant attempted to claim pre-litigation privilege applied to 
statements made to the press, this Court denied summary judgment, and held, “[t]o prevail on a 
qualified privilege defense [defendant] must show that his claim of privilege does not raise 
triable issues of fact that would defeat it.” Block v. First Blood Associates, 691 F. Supp. 685, 
699-700 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (denying summary judgment on the pre-litigation qualified 
privilege affirmative defense because there was “a genuine issue as to malice and appropriate 
purpose”). Defendant’s claim here likewise fails. 

First, Defendant’s testimony makes no mention of any contemplated lawsuit — much less, 
any contemplated lawsuit against Ms. Giuffre. Second, Defendant has offered no witnesses who 
will testify that she intended to bring any law suit. Third, she did not, in fact, bring any such 


lawsuit. The only “evidence” is a post hoc Declaration written by her attorney. Finally, it must be 


41 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page5S0O of 74 


remembered, as explained at length above, the Defendant had sexually trafficking Defendant and 
was attempting to continue to conceal her criminal acts. Whether her statements had an 
“appropriate purpose,” Block 691 F. Supp. at 699-700 (Sweet, J.) — or were, rather, efforts by a 
criminal organization to silence its victims — is obviously contested. Accordingly, obvious issues 
of fact exist as to whether or not Defendant contemplated litigation. 

Distorting reality, Defendant further argues: “Statements pertinent to a good faith 
anticipated litigation made by attorneys (or their agents under their direction) before the 
commencement of litigation are privileged.” (MSJ at 33). The record evidence shows that 
Defendant’s attorney did not make the defamatory statement. Further, Defendant’s attorney’s 
agents did not make the defamatory statement. Defendant did. And, there was no statement made 
by anyone “before the commencement of litigation” because /itigation never commenced. 
Accordingly, the cases Defendant cites where attorneys are making statements (or where clients 
are making statements to their attorneys regarding judicial proceedings including malpractice) 


are wholly inapposite as detailed below. 


45 


¢ Front v. Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 720 (2015) - statement made by attorney.

opinion outside courthouse calling plaintiff liar . . . is not similarly immune.” (This case undermines the false 
argument Defendant tries to make).

firm sued for defamation. 








ue was made by an 
iable controversy against the 





42 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page51 of 74 


Similarly, in Black v. Green Harbour Homeowners’ Ass'n, Inc., 19 A.D.3d 962, 963, 798 
N.Y.S.2d 753, 754 (2005), cited by Defendant, the Court held a privilege applied to a letter sent 
by a home owner’s association board of directors to the association’s members informing them 
of the status of litigation to which the association was a party, and to the association’s letter to 
the state attorney general sent to discharge it’s duties to the association. In this case, litigation 
was actually pending, the communication was sent by a party to that litigation as part of its 
duties, and the communication itself concerned the litigation. Defendant’s press release fits none 
of those descriptions. 

Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites to no case in which a Court has held that this or any 
qualified privilege extends to internationally disseminated press releases defaming a non-party to 
the purported “anticipated” litigation. Regardless of whether or not Barden had a hand in drafting 
the statement (another disputed issue of fact for the jury), Defendant issued the statement, 
instructed that it be published, and the statement she issued was attributed to her, and not to her 
attorney (or his agents). Accordingly, all the case law Defendant cites about an attorney making 
a statement (or a client making a statement to their attorney or malpractice carrier) is inapposite. 


2. Defendant is foreclosed from using the pre-litigation privilege because 
she acted with malice. 


In any event, because Defendant acted with malice, she cannot avail herself of the pre- 
litigation privilege. As this Court has explained denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss, “‘There 
is no qualified privilege under New York law when such statements are spoken with malice, 
knowledge of their falsity, or reckless disregard for their truth.’” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. 
Supp. 3d at 155 (citing Block, 691 F. Supp. at 699 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. 1988). There is ample 
record evidence that Defendant acted with malice in issuing the press release, thereby making the 


litigation privilege inapplicable. See Block, 691 F. Supp. at 700 (Sweet, J.) (“Here, sufficient 


43 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page52 of 74 


evidence has been adduced to support the inference that [defendant] acted with malice, and may 
not, therefore, claim a qualified privilege under New York law . . . a genuine issue as to malice 
and appropriate purpose has properly been raised and is sufficient to preclude summary 
judgment.”). For example, Ms. Sjoberg testified that Defendant recruited her for sex with 
Epstein, thus corroborating Ms. Giuffre’s own account of Defendant’s involvement in abusing 
her with Epstein. For another example, Jeffrey Epstein’s pilot testified that Defendant flew with 
Ms. Giuffre on at least 23 flights, thus corroborating Ms. Giuffre’s claims against Defendant. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 15, Rodgers Dep. Tr., at 34:3-10. For another example, Tony 
Figueroa testified that Defendant asked him for assistance in recruiting girls for Epstein — more 
testimony that corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims against Defendant. 

Defendant’s statements that Ms. Giuffre was lying and her claims of sexual abuse were 
“obvious lies” were not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation but, instead, they were 
made for an inappropriate purpose — i.e., to bully, harass, intimidate, and ultimately silence Ms. 
Giuffre. As the record evidence shows, Defendant knew the statements were false because 
Defendant engaged in and facilitated the sexual abuse of this minor child, therefore, they were 
made for the inappropriate purpose of “bullying,” “harassment,” and “intimidation.” See Front v. 
Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 720 (2015). Simply put, Defendant sexually trafficked Ms. Giuffre — and 
then tried to silence Ms. Giuffre to keep her crimes secret — circumstances that prevent her from 
using privileges designed to shield legitimate legal disputes from court interference. 

New York case law fully confirms that pre-litigation qualified privilege does not apply to 
this case. Historically, statements made in the course of litigation were entitled to privilege from 
defamations claims “so that those discharging a public function may speak freely to zealously 


represent their clients without fear of reprisal or financial hazard.” Jd. at 718. A 2015 New York 


44 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page53 of 74 


Court of Appeals case somewhat extended this privilege by holding that statements made by 
attorneys prior to the commencement of the litigation are protected by a qualified privilege if 
those statements are pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation. /d. at 718. (“Although it is 
well settled that statements made in the course of litigation are entitled to absolute privilege, the 
Court has not directly addressed whether statements made by an attorney on behalf of his or her 
client in connection with prospective litigation are privileged” . . . “to advance the goals of 
encouraging communication prior to the commencement of litigation” . . . “we hold that 
statements made prior to the commencement of an anticipated litigation are privileged, and that 
the privilege is lost where a defendant proves that the statements were not pertinent to a good 
faith anticipated litigation.”). 

The Court of Appeals’ reason for allowing this qualified privilege could not be more 
clear: “When litigation is anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to communicate in 
order to reduce or avoid the need to actually commence litigation. Attorneys often send cease 
and desist letters to avoid litigation. Applying privilege to such preliminary communication 
encourages potential defendants to negotiate with potential plaintiffs in order to prevent costly 
and time consuming judicial intervention.” /d. at 719-20. Under this rationale, the Khalil court 
found that an attorney’s letters to the potential defendant were privileged because they were sent 
“in an attempt to avoid litigation by requesting, among other things, that Khalil return the alleged 
stolen proprietary information and cease and desist his use of that information.” /d. at 720. 

Here, quite unlike Khalil, the Defendant’s statements were (1) made by a non-attorney 
(Defendant through Gow); (2) concerning a non-party to any alleged anticipated litigation; (3) 


knowingly false statements; and (4) contained in a press release directed at, and disseminated to, 


45 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page54 of 74 


the public at large. Defendant’s statements cannot be considered “pertinent to a good faith 
anticipated litigation,” such that the qualified privilege should apply. 

Finally, though it strains credulity to even entertain the prospect, if Defendant could 
make even colorable showings on these basic issues, it would remain an issue of fact for the jury 
to determine whether or not Defendant’s press release, calling Ms. Giuffre’s sex abuse claims 
“obvious lies,” was any type of “cease-and-desist” statement or a statement that acted to “reduce 
or avoid” or resolve any “anticipated” litigation. Summary judgment is obviously inappropriate 
here as well. 


3. Defendant cannot invoke the pre-litigation privilege because she has 
no “meritorious claim” for “good faith” litigation. 


Finally, Defendant cannot prevail in asserting this qualified privilege because, in order to 
invoke this privilege, she must have “meritorious claims” for “good faith anticipated litigation.” 
Khalil specifically states that for the qualified privilege to apply, the statements must be made 
“pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation,” and it does not protect attorneys . . . asserting 
wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact, in violation of counsel’s ethical 
obligations.” Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d at 718, 720 (emphasis added). Defendant has neither 
“meritorious claims” nor “good faith anticipated litigation.” Defendant cannot have a 
“meritorious claim” for “good faith anticipated litigation” against the press (or Ms. Giuffre) 
because Ms. Giuffre’s reports of her sexual abuse are true, Defendant knows that they are true, 
and Defendant made a knowingly false statement when she called Ms. Giuffre a liar. Under these 
circumstances, Defendant has no “meritorious” claim to make in “good faith” relating to either 
Ms. Giuffre’s statements or their coverage in the press, thereby making her defamatory 


statements wholly outside the protection of this qualified privilege. At the very least, the issue of 


46 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page55 of 74 


whether Defendant has meritorious claims against the press on the grounds that she did not abuse 
Ms. Giuffre is a question of fact for the jury to decide. 


Vv. DEFENDANT HAS NOT - AND CANNOT - SHOW THAT HER DEFAMATORY 
STATEMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE 


Defendant next claims that her press release calling Ms. Giuffre a liar about her past sex 
abuse was somehow “substantially true.” Here again, this is a highly disputed claim. On its face, 
to determine what is “substantially” true or not requires extensive fact finding, such as whether 
Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre as a minor child for sex with Defendant’s live-in boyfriend and 
convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate. See 
Mitre Sports Intern. Ltd. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 255 (S.D.N.Y.2014) 
(denying summary judgment because it would require the Court to decide disputed facts to 
determine whether the statement at issue was substantially true); Da Silva v. Time Inc., 908 F. 
Supp. 184, 187 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (denying motion for summary judgment because there was a 
genuine issue of material act as to whether defamatory photo and caption were not true, stating 
“{iJn the instant case Da Silva’s contention that she was a reformed prostitute at the time of 
photography and publication provides a rational basis upon which a fact-finder could conclude 
that the photograph was not substantially true”). 

Additionally, Defendant has remarkably not submitted any evidence that she did not 
recruit Ms. Giuffre for sex with Epstein. Nor has Defendant offered any evidence that her role in 
Epstein’s household was not to recruit girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. Accordingly, 
summary judgment is inappropriate. See Stern v. Cosby, 645 F. Supp. 2d 258, 277 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009) (because defendant had “not submitted any evidence to show that Statement 11 is 


substantially true, her motion for summary judgment as to Statement 11 is denied”). 


47 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page56 of 74 


Further, much of the purported evidence upon which Defendant relies to allege the truth 
of her defamatory statement is merely hearsay, including inadmissible hearsay statements made 
by Alan Dershowitz, who Defendant did not depose in this case (and whom Ms. Giuffre has not 
had an opportunity to cross examine). Hearsay cannot establish the truth of a defamatory 
statement as a matter of law at summary judgment. Lopez v. Univision Communications, Inc., 45 
F. Supp.2d 348, 359 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (denying summary judgment and holding “defendants’ 
evidence as to what they were told by representatives of NYU and Kean College, to the extent 
offered for the truth of the matters asserted, is inadmissible hearsay and an insufficient basis 
upon which to grant summary judgment of dismissal on the ground that the statements were 
substantially true.”). 

Finally, many of the facts upon which Defendant bases her argument that her defamatory 
statement was true are wholly tangential to the claims against her by Ms. Giuffre and the 
defamatory statement. For example, Defendant supports her contention that she did not recruit 
Ms. Giuffre for sex with Epstein based on the fact that Ms. Giuffre lived independently of her 
parents before meeting Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. (Of course, a child outside the supervision of 
her parents makes it much more likely she would be recruited by Defendant into sex trafficking, 
but that is for the jury to decide.) That fact does not go to whether or not Defendant’s statement 
calling Ms. Giuffre a liar is true, because Ms. Giuffre never made any claims relating to where 
she lived prior to meeting Defendant. Moreover, it is immaterial with whom she was living: the 
fundamental and overarching fact remains that Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre for sex with 
Epstein when she was a minor child. 

Defendant next proffers Ms. Giuffre’s limited high school enrollment and short-term jobs 


that she held as evidence that she and Epstein did not abuse her. The logic of this position is 


48 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page57 of 74 


unclear. The fact that Ms. Giuffre worked at Taco Bell for a few days hardly establishes she was 

not abused by Defendant and Epstein. Indeed, if anything its shows the vulnerability of Ms. 

Giuffre to enticements that a billionaire and his wealthy and powerful girlfriend could offer. In 

any event, what to make of such fact is something for the jury to consider. They are irrelevant for 

the same reason as above: Ms. Giuffre never made any claims about her studies or her prior 

employment. Indeed, neither Ms. Giuffre’s statement about being recruited by Defendant as a 

child, nor Defendant’s refutation even mentions Ms. Giuffre’s lack of schooling or lack of a 

stable home as a child. Purported facts that have nothing to do with Ms. Giuffre’s claims of 

sexual abuse against Defendant, and nothing to do with Defendant calling Ms. Giuffre a liar for 
such claims, do not establish the “substantial truth” of Defendant’s statement. Tellingly, 

Defendant cites to no analogous case in any jurisdiction that even suggests otherwise. 

VI. PLAINTIFF DOES NOT NEED TO ESTABLISH MALICE FOR HER 
DEFAMATION CLAIM, BUT IN THE EVENT THE COURT RULES 
OTHERWISE, THERE IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT RECORD EVIDENCE 
FOR A REASONABLE JURY TO DETERMINE DEFENDANT ACTED WITH 
ACTUAL MALICE 
Defendant’s next (and, again, quite remarkable) argument is that Ms. Giuffre somehow 

will be unable to establish actual malice in this case. One would think that a sex trafficker calling 

one of her victims a liar would be a quintessential example of actual malice. Defendant’s 
spurious case citations and misplaced argument do not detract from this core fact. 


Though Defendant does not mention the legal standard for actual malice until she is 48 


pages into her 68-page brief,” the legal definition of actual malice, as defined by the United 


4 Though perhaps a scrivener’s error, Defendant errantly cites to two Supreme Court cases ~ Gerts v. Robert Welch, 
Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974) and Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767 (1986) — that arose out of the 
laws of Illinois and Pennsylvania, respectively, to support a proposition concerning New York law. Defendant also 
cites to Harte-Hanks Commc'ns, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 109 S, Ct. 2678, 105 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1989), 
wherein the ruling was not at summary judgment, and the plaintiff in the defamation case was a judicial candidate in 
a public election. 


49 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page58 of 74 


States Supreme Court, and reiterated by the Second Circuit, should be the light by which all of 
Defendant’s purported “facts” and argument should be viewed. “Actual malice” means that the 
statement was published with “knowledge that the statement was ‘false or with reckless 
disregard of whether it was false or not.’” Baiul v. Disson, 607 F. App'x 18, 20 (2d Cir. 2015), 
quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 280, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 
(1964). 

Defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre is a limited purpose public figure. While Ms. Giuffre 
disputes that claim, the issue is entirely irrelevant here because Ms. Giuffre will prove at trial, 
with overwhelming evidence, that Defendant made her statement calling Ms. Giuffre a liar with 
malice, fully knowing — as a sex trafficker — that it was false. Put another way, Defendant knew 
that Ms. Giuffre was telling the truth when she described how Defendant recruited her for sex as 
an underage girl and then sexually trafficked her with her boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein. 

The Second Circuit instructs that, “[o]n a motion for summary judgment, a court cannot 
try issues of fact; it can only determine whether there are issues to be tried. If, as to the issue on 
which summary judgment is sought, there is any evidence in the record from any source from 
which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, summary 
judgment is improper.” Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994) 
(internal citations and quotations omitted). “As the moving party, Defendants have the burden of 
demonstrating an absence of clear and convincing evidence substantiating Plaintiffs’ claims.” De 
Sole v. Knoedler Gallery, LLC, 139 F. Supp. 3d 618, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Chambers). 

Defendant fails to meet her burden of demonstrating an absence of clear and convincing 
evidence substantiating Ms. Giuffre’s claims that Defendant acted with actual malice. Ms. 


Giuffre will easily be able to meet any trial burden of clear and convincing evidence of actual 


50 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page59 of 74 


malice. Tellingly, Defendant does not even attempt to address the documentary evidence, nor the 
testimonial evidence showing she was a recruiter of girls for Epstein. 

As shown above, far beyond showing that a reasonable inference could be drawn in her 
favor, which is all that is required at this point to defeat Defendant’s motion, Ms. Giuffre will 
easily be able to meet her trial burden of clear and convincing evidence of actual malice. 

Of course, a plaintiff need only show “actual malice” on the part of a defendant if that 
plaintiff is a public figure or a limited public figure, which Ms. Giuffre is not, as explained infra. 


VII. THE COURT NEED NOT REACH THE ISSUE, AT THIS TIME, OF WHETHER 
MS. GIUFFRE IS A LIMITED PURPOSE PUBLIC FIGURE 


For the reasons just explained, Ms. Giuffre will easily be able to prove actual malice at 
the trial in this case. Defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre “is a public figure who must prove actual 
malice.” MSJ at 49. Given the overwhelming proof of the second part of that statement, the 
Court need not spend its time considering the first. 

If the Court wishes to nonetheless consider the issue at this time, it is not appropriate for 
disposition at the summary judgment stage of this case. The defendant bears the burden of 
demonstrating that the plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure. See Lerman v. Flynt Distrib. 
Co., 745 F.2d 123, 136-37 (2d Cir. 1984). Defendant correctly articulates the legal test for a 
finding that a plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure, but glosses over the fact that all prongs 
of the test must be met in order for a court to make that finding. See, e.g., Contemporary 
Mission, Inc. v. N.Y. Times Co., 842 F.2d 612, 617 (2d Cir. 1988) (“[T]his court set forth a four 
part test for determining whether someone is a limited purpose public figure” (emphasis added)); 
Herbert v. Lando, 596 F. Supp. 1178, 1186 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (“The Second Circuit recently 
summarized the criteria” (emphasis added)), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 781 F.2d 298 (2d Cir. 


1986); cf: Nehls v. Hillsdale Coll., 178 F. Supp. 2d 771, 778 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (finding plaintiff 


Sl 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page60 of 74 


was not a limited public figure for failing one element of the Lerman test and thus denying 
defendant’s motion for summary judgment) (“The defendant has proven all of the elements but 
the third ...”), aff'd, 65 F. App’x 984 (6th Cir. 2003). Of course, proof that Ms. Giuffre (or 
anyone else) is a limited purpose public figure requires proof of a set of facts from which Ms. 
Giuffre believes Defendant has not shown in satisfaction of the four-part test. 

Significantly this Court should pause here to note that the details of Jane Doe 3’s sexual 
exploitation and abuse, as anonymously set forth in her CVRA joinder motion, caused the 
Defendant to identify, with certainty, Jane Doe 3 as Ms. Giuffre. Yet, at her deposition, 
Defendant claimed to “barely remember her at all.”*” Defendant’s ability to immediately and 
positively identify the anonymous individual making claims of sexual abuse, if anything, shows 
that Defendant was intimately aware of Ms. Giuffre’s sexual exploitation. 

And, to be sure, Ms. Giuffre never asked to be sexually abused or trafficked by 
Defendant or convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when she was a child — legally, she did not 
even have the capacity to consent. Defendant cannot recruit a minor child for sexual exploitation 
and then, afterwards, argue that her victim injected herself into the public controversy when 
coming forward about the abuse she suffered. 

Moreover, Defendant has not made a sufficient showing that Ms. Giuffre has “regular” 
and “continuing” access to the news media. The policy rationale behind this prong is that public 
figures generally enjoy significant access to the media. One reporter wrote some articles on Ms. 
Giuffre in 2011. Thereafter, it was not until 2015, that Ms. Giuffre spoke to someone in the news 
media about these issues, and that interview was granted after Defendant’s defamatory remarks. 
Such limited contacts precludes a finding that Ms. Giuffre is a limited public figure. See 


*” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. at 44:23-45:4 (July 22, 2016) (“Q. You do remember 
Virginia, about that time back in the 2000s, giving Mr. Epstein massages? A. I barely remember her at all.”). 


52 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page61 of 74 


Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 99 S. Ct. 2675, 61 L.Ed.2d 411 (1979) (finding plaintiff 
maintained no regular and continuing access to the media and thus was not a public figure). 

It is also unclear how Defendant plans to show that Ms. Giuffre “successfully invited 
public attention to her views.” To be sure, Ms. Giuffre decided to start “Victims Refuse Silence,” 
a not-for-profit organization whose mission is “to change the landscape of the war on sexual 
abuse and human trafficking. Our goal is to undertake an instrumental role in helping survivors 
break the silence associated with sexual abuse. To fulfill this mission, we aim to enhance the 
lives of women who have been victimized.”** The website lists the National Trafficking Hotline, 
and provides a state-by-state resources for local organizations where victims can seek help. 
Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites no cases that hold that maintaining a website makes one a public 
figure. See Mitre Sports Int'l Ltd. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 252 (S.D.N.Y. 
2014) (finding plaintiff was not a limited public figure and denying defendant’s motion for 
summary judgment) (“corporate policy denouncing child labor on its website ... do[es] not show 
that Mitre ... aimed to influence the public’s views on the controversy”). More important, 
Defendant does not explain how Ms. Giuffre was using the website to influence public views on 
whether she had been abused by Defendant — the subject at issue in this lawsuit. 

Interestingly, Defendant has spent $ 17,875“ on an expert witness to tell the Court and 
the jury that hardly anyone searches on the internet using search terms such as “victims refuse 
silence sex slave.” One of Defendant’s six briefs raising Daubert issues specifically argues that 
Dr. Anderson’s estimates on the cost of remediating Ms. Giuffre’s online reputation are improper 
because Dr. Anderson included nearly unused search phrases when evaluating internet content. 
Kent’s rebuttal report states: “. . . there seems no reason to believe that such a person would use 


“Shttp://www.victimsrefusesilence.org/our-mission. 
*® See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 9, Kent Dep. Tr. at 25:16-26:6. 


53 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page62 of 74 


this term . . . Indeed, these are terms unlikely to be used by anyone unfamiliar with this litigation. 
. .. Why, for instance, would it be necessary to push down offending Web pages in the results 
that the search engines provide for the term victim’s refuse silence sex slave, when this term is 
likely never used . . .” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 25, Kent Report at 10, 33. 

Defendant cannot argue to the Court that Ms. Giuffre has “successfully” invited public 
attention to her views through her VRS website while simultaneously filing a Daubert motion 
that argues that search terms such as “victims refuse silence sex slave” are “likely never used,” 
thus making the website unsuccessful in inviting public attention. In any event, Defendant has 
failed to set forth with precision the allegedly undisputed fact — and supporting evidence — she 
uses to support her argument. 

Moreover, “[i]t is preferable to reduce the public figure question to a more meaningful 
context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual’s participation in the particular 
controversy giving rise to the defamation.” Greenberg v. CBS Inc., 69 A.D.2d 693, 704, 419 
N.Y.S.2d 988, 995 (1979) (emphasis added), citing Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 
345, 352, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789. The context here is highly significant. Ms. Giuffre 
never chose to participate in Defendant and Epstein’s underage sex ring, a “controversy” that 
gave rise to Defendant’s defamation. In arguing that Ms. Giuffre thrust herself into the public 
spotlight, Defendant conveniently leaves out the fact that it is by her doing that Ms. Giuffre is in 
this controversy in the first place. No minor child willingly becomes a participant in sexual 
abuse, and it is perverse for the abuser to argue that her victim deliberately became a subject of 
public attention when speaking out about that abuse for the purpose of advancing justice and 


helping other victims. 


54 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page63 of 74 


For all these reasons, the Court should simply decline to decide the public figure issue at 
this juncture. But if it chooses to reach the issue, it should reject Defendant’s unsupported 
argument. 

VII. THE JANUARY 2015 STATEMENT WAS NOT “SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE,” 

AND MS. GIUFFRE HAS PRODUCED CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE 

OF ITS FALSITY 

As a final argument, Defendant argues that her January 2015 statement was “substantially 
true.” Given that the statement argues that Ms. Giuffre lied when she said she was sexually 
trafficked by Defendant, the reader of Defendant’s motion might reasonably expect to see some 
evidence presented showing that Defendant was not a sex trafficker. Instead, the reader is treated 
to technical quibbles. For example, the lead argument to show the “substantial” truth of 
Defendant’s statement is the argument that Ms. Giuffre was not fifteen years old, but all of 
sixteen or seventeen years old when she was trafficked. As the Court knows (and can take 
judicial notice of), Florida law makes age eighteen the age of consent. Accordingly, it is no 
moment that Ms. Giuffre may have been mistaken about the exact year the sex trafficking 
started. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense. To 
even describe the defense is to show how meritless it is. 

More broadly, at issue are the statements Ms. Giuffre made regarding Defendant’s 
involvement in, and knowledge of, the sexual abuse and sex trafficking of Ms. Giuffre (and other 
minor girls) through a recruitment scheme executed by Defendant and Jeffrey Epstein. In 
response to those various statements, Defendant publicly claimed that, “the allegations made by 
(Ms. Giuffre) against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” Defendant continued that Ms. Giuffre’s 


“claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such....” Defendant, through her statement 


55 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page64 of 74 


intended to convey that Ms. Giuffre was lying about everything she had said against Defendant — 


“the allegations.” 


In sum and essence, those statements made by Ms. Giuffre about which Defendant 


released a public statement to exclaim were “untrue” and “obvious lies” were:

encounter was had; 

That Defendant and Epstein expressed approval for Ms. Giuffre, and offered her

56 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page65 of 74 


Defendant, by way of her January 2015 statement, declared that Ms. Giuffre lied about 
each and every one of these allegations regarding Defendant. In fact, Defendant clarified further 
this position in her deposition when she said repeatedly that everything Ms. Giuffre said about 
Defendant was totally false.*° The clarification in her deposition is identical in intention to the 
reasonable interpretation of her statement that Defendant made publicly, which has formed the 
basis of this defamation action—that Ms. Giuffre was lying about everything she said about 
Defendant, and that Defendant was not at all involved in the activity she was accused of 
engaging in. 

While her public statement could not have been more clear, as her deposition testimony 
further underscored, Defendant intended the world to believe that nothing Ms. Giuffre said about 
Defendant was true, and that Defendant was not at all involved with any of the things she was 
accused of, Defendant has decided in this motion to minutely dissect the nuance of Ms. Giuffre’s 
various statements to cause the Court to reach a far-fetched conclusion that Defendant’s 
insidiously false statement was somehow “substantially true.” Ironically, this 
repositioning amounts to nothing more than an admission by Defendant of the defamatory nature 
of her statement. 

A. When Ms. Giuffre Initially Described Her Encounters With Defendant and 

Epstein, She Mistakenly Believed the First Encounter Occurred During the 
Year 1999, 

Discovery has resulted in the production of records, including Ms. Giuffre’s employment 
records from Mar-a-Lago, which she did not possess at the time she was recounting her 
interactions with Defendant. Those records establish that the initial encounter wherein Defendant 


recruited Ms. Giuffre occurred during the year 2000 and not during 1999. Ms. Giuffre was 


* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 135:3-4; 178:15-178:24; 179:20-180:7; 228:7- 
229:10. 


s7 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page66 of 74 


sixteen years old before August 9, 2000, and turned seventeen on that date. It is unclear from the 
limited records available whether Defendant approached and recruited Ms. Giuffre before or just 
after Ms. Giuffre’s 17th birthday. However, what has now been established through numerous 
witnesses is that Defendant approached and recruited a minor child for the purposes of enticing 
that minor over to the house of Jeffrey Epstein, a currently-registered sex offender.*! The exact 
lure of Ms. Giuffre by Defendant - enticement of being paid money to give a billionaire a 
massage at his mansion - was used by Epstein and his many associates and employees to recruit 
dozens and dozens of other underage girls. There is no doubt that the crux of Ms. Giuffre’s 
statement on this point is that Defendant recruited her when she was only a minor child unable to 
consent to sex, not precisely how far under the age of consent she was. Defendant’s public claim 
that Ms. Giuffre’s account of this approach, and recruiting element, was “untrue” and “obvious 
lies” is not “substantially true,” but is itself an obvious lie — as Ms. Giuffre will prove to the jury 
at trial. 

B. Defendant’s January 2015 Statement Claiming as “Untrue” and an “Obvious 

Lie” the Allegation That She Regularly Participated in Epstein’s Sexual 
Exploitation of Minors and That the Government Knows Such Fact is Not 
Substantially True But Instead Completely False. 

Defendant next argues that she “accurately denied that [she] ‘regularly participate[d] in 
Epstein’s sexual exploitation on minors’ and that ‘the Government knows such fact.’”” MSJ at 58. 
It is not clear whether Defendant is nitpicking this statement by contesting whether she 
“regularly” participated in Epstein’s sexual exploitation or whether she did participate, but the 
Government was unaware of the extent of her involvement. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex- 


trafficker-but-only-on-Tuesdays-and-Thursdays” defense — here again, to simply recount the 


claim is to see its absurdity. 


*! See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, 5, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 94:24-95:2; Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21; 116:19- 
117:12. 


58 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page67 of 74 


Contrary to Defendant’s misleading, cherry-picked fragments of information she has 
chosen to use to support her point, there is an abundance of evidence clearly linking Defendant 
to Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors. As the Court is aware, numerous message pads were 
recovered from Epstein’s home indicating Defendant’s involvement in and knowledge of 
Epstein’s illegal exploitation. oe Additionally, numerous employees and others have testified 
about Defendant’s high-ranking position in the hierarchal structure of the sexual exploitation 
scheme. ™ In fact, multiple individuals, in addition to the Ms. Giuffre, have testified about 
Maxwell’s involvement in the exploitation of minors, including Ms. Giuffre.** 

Defendant also argues that one government investigator, Palm Beach, Florida, Detective 
Recarey, may not have been aware of her involvement in the sex trafficking. Defendant fails to 
cite another passage in Detective Recarey’s deposition, where he noted that he was aware of 
Defendant’s involvement with Epstein and the sexual exploitation of children.** But even 
assuming Recarey was unaware (which Ms. Giuffre strongly disputes), Defendant would have, at 
most, a “‘yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-I-successfully-hid-it-from-one-of-the-cops” defense — 
again, not a likely claim. 

More broadly, Ms. Giuffre’s statement about what the “Government” knew about sex 
trafficking was made in pleadings filed in a federal Court case attacking the decision of the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida to offer Jeffrey Epstein immunity from 
prosecution for federal sex trafficking crimes. Accordingly, to present an even arguable claim for 


summary judgment, Defendant would have to show that the U.S. Attorney’s Office (and its

investigators from the FBI) did not know about Defendant’s sex trafficking. This proof would 
need to include, for example, evidence that the FBI did not learn about Defendant’s sex 
trafficking when (among other things) Ms. Giuffre told FBI agents about it when she met with 


them in Australia in 2011. Here again, Defendant has no evidence to even begin making such a 


showing. 
c Defendant’s January 2015 Statement Claiming as “Untrue” or an “Obvious 
Lie” That Maxwell and Epstein Converted Ms. Giuffre Into a Sexual Slave is 
Not Substantially True. 


Defendant next argues that she accurately disputed Ms. Giuffre’s statement that 
Defendant held her as a “sex slave.” Relying on dictionary definitions of “slave” that define the 
term to refer to a “confined” person who is the “legal property” of another (MSJ at 59, citing 
Merriam-Webster, etc.), Defendant claims Ms. Giuffre was not confined or the property of 
Defendant. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-I-didn’t-use-chains” defense. And, once 
again, to even describe the defense is to refute it. 

Defendant does not explain why the jury would be required to use the held-in-chains 
definition of “slave” in evaluating her statement. Merriam-Webster (11" ed. 2006) also defines 
“slave” as “one that is completely subservient to a dominating influence” — a definition that fits 
Ms. Giuffre’s circumstances to a tee. As Ms. Giuffre has explained in detail, she was recruited as 
a minor child by Defendant, who then dominated her and used for sexual purposes. That 
testimony alone creates a genuine issue of fact on this point. 

From the context of all of Ms. Giuffre’s statements about Defendant, Ms. Giuffre has 
never said or implied that she was physically placed in a cage. Instead, she has described the vast 
disparity of power and the influence of Defendant and Epstein, the fear of disobedience, the 
typical locations of the abuse being in a private plane, in huge mansion manned with Epstein 


employed servants, a private island, or some inescapable place abroad in the presence of 


60 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page69 of 74 


Defendant, in addition to the continued — and fraudulent — promise of a better future, as those 
things that kept her retained in a situation of sexual servitude. While not physical chained, Ms. 
Giuffre was groomed as minor and trained, and these factors became her invisible chains. 
Indeed, as Ms. Giuffre’s expert on sex trafficking, Professor Coonan, has explained: 

Popular understandings of the term “sex slave” might still connote images of 

violent pimps, white slavery, or of victims chained to a bed in a brothel in the 

minds of some people. To call Ms. Giuffre a victim of sex trafficking would 

however very accurately convey the reality that she along with a great many other 

victims of contemporary forms of slavery are often exploited by the “invisible 

chains” of fraud and psychological coercion. 

See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 23, Coonan Expert Report at 20. 

If the Court takes as true, which it must for the purpose of this motion, that Ms. Giuffre 
was trafficked and used exclusively for sexual purposes by Defendant and Epstein, then the 
Court must also reach the conclusion at this stage that Maxwell’s assertion — that Ms. Giuffre’s 
description of being a sex slave is “untrue” or “obvious lies” — is not substantially true. There 
undoubtedly remains a genuine issue of material fact on this point, and in fact, Defendant’s 
position taken in this motion is tantamount to an admission of the truth of Plaintiff's statement 
about Defendant on this point. 

D. Any Statement of Misdirection Regarding Professor Alan Dershowitz is 

Nothing More Than an Irrelevant Distraction to The Facts of This Case and 


Matters Not on the Defense of Whether Defendant’s Statement Was 
Substantially True. 


Defendant next contends that she accurately recounted that Alan Dershowitz had denied 
having sex with Ms. Giuffre. MSJ at 60. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-she-was-not- 
trafficked-to-the-professor” defense. While it is accurate that Ms. Giuffre made allegations 
against Professor Dershowitz, those allegations are not at issue in this case. Defendant, in her 
defamatory statement, claimed that “the allegations made by [Ms. Giuffre] against Ghislaine 


Maxwell are untrue.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 26, GM_00068. In her deposition, 
61 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page70 of 74 


Defendant maintained the position that she “cannot speculate on what anybody else did or didn’t 
do.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 180:3-180:4. In fact, 
regarding Ms. Giuffre’s claims about others, Defendant unequivocally stated, “I can only testify 


to what she said about me, which was 1000 percent false.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, 





Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 228:10-228:12. 

Defendant Maxwell makes additional misstatements about Dershowitz’s production in a 
defamation action filed against him in her desperate attempt to have Dershowitz to jump aboard 
and help bail out her sinking canoe. While Ms. Giuffre can — and, if necessary, will — refute 
Dershowitz’s claim he was not a beneficiary of Epstein and Defendant’s sex trafficking, that is 
not relevant at this stage. Whatever may or may not have happened with Dershowitz (and Ms. 
Giuffre’s sworn statements that he sexually abused her is alone enough to create disputed facts 
on the issue of whether Defendant’s statements about him were “substantially true”) has no 
bearing whatsoever on the truth or falsity of the statements Ms. Giuffre made about Defendant. 

This case is not about whether Ms. Giuffre has ever made untruthful allegations against 
anyone, which she contends she has not, but about whether her allegations about Defendant 


were true, or whether those specific allegations were “untrue,” “obvious lies” as Defendant 
publicly proclaimed. These issues are disputed and must go to the jury. 

E. Contrary to Defendant’s Position, There is a Genuine Issue of Material Fact 
as to Whether She Created or Distributed Child Pornography, or Whether 
the Government Was Aware of Same. 

Defendant next argues that she did not create child pornography and that the Government 

knew this. Call this the “until-you-find-the-photos-I’ m-innocent” defense. Of course, as noted 


earlier, Defendant’s claim requires that she show that “the Government” — in context, the FBI 


and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida — “knew” that she had no 


62 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page71 of 74 


child pornography. Yet Defendant has offered no such evidence — much less evidence so 
powerful as to warrant summary judgment on this point. 

This point is disputed from the simple fact that Ms. Giuffre herself testified that 
Defendant took many photograph of her naked. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. 
Tr. at 232:3-9; 233:7-9. This is consistent with the Palm Beach butler’s, Alfredo Rodriguez’s, 
testimony that he personally saw photos of naked children on Defendant’s computer. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24. Another 
housekeeper, Juan Alessi also saw photos of young nude females on Defendant’s computer, 
although he wasn’t sure whether to consider it pornography. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, 
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 175:5-175:24. Finally, Detective Recarey found a collage of nude photos of 
young females in Epstein’s closet, and turned the photos over to the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s 
office.*° While the U.S. Attorney’s office will not share the photos obtained from Recarey’s 
investigation, it is thus undisputed that the government possesses photos of nude, young females 
confiscated from Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Indeed, the police video disclosed through a 
FOIA request shows naked images of women throughout the house, including a full nude of the 
Defendant.*’ At a minimum, there is a clear genuine issue of material fact in this regard. 


F. Defendant Did Act as a “Madame” For Epstein to Traffic Ms. Giuffre to The 
Rich and Famous. 


Defendant next argues that she did not act as a “Madame” for Epstein. MSJ at 63. The 
gist of the argument seems to be that Defendant believes trafficking one girl to Epstein does not 
a Madame make. Call this the “yes-I-was-Virginia’s-Madame-but-no-one-else’s” defense. This 


argument fails linguistically on the very dictionary definitions that Defendant cites elsewhere — 


* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24; 74:2-74:7. 
*” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 44, FOIA CD GIUFFRE 007584. 


63 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page72 of 74 


but not here. See Merriam-Webster (1 1" ed. 2006) (defining “madam” as “the female head of a 
house of prostitution”). 

Once again, Defendant conceals the relevant facts on this issue. First, multiple witnesses 
have testified to Defendant’s recruiting, maintaining, harboring, and trafficking girls for 
Epstein.** In fact, Defendant herself was unable to deny procuring Ms. Giuffre for Epstein.” 
While Defendant has attempted to fumble her way through explaining some plausible reason for 
bringing a sixteen or seventeen year old to Epstein, her explanations are, to put it blandly, 
unpersuasive. As with other issues, the jury will have to decide who to believe. 

One of the individuals Ms. Giuffre was trafficked to was Prince Andrew — trafficking that 
took place in Defendant’s own townhouse in London. There exist flight logs evidencing Ms. 
Giuffre flying to London alongside Defendant and Epstein on Epstein’s private plane, and a 
photo of Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, and the Prince, without Defendant ever offering a legal 
reasonable explanation for that photo being taken, or for traveling with a year old girl overseas. 

Defendant begins to meander somewhat aimlessly on this point, shifting Plaintiff's 
burden to substantiate Plaintiff's claim that Defendant was Epstein’s Madame, which is a point 
at issue, into whether or not Plaintiff has conclusively proven the identities and accurate job titles 
of the other men to whom Plaintiff was lent for sex by Epstein. No matter how hard Defendant 
tries to reframe this case, drag other people in, or split hairs, she is unable to contest the facts — 
facts showing she was more than a Madame but a full-fledged sex trafficker. Ms. Giuffre told the 


truth when she said that Defendant recruited her as a minor, under the pretense of giving a 


** See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, 1, 18, 2, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 13; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 34; GIUFFRE000105 at 57-

massage, and converted her into a traveling sex slave, consistent with Defendant and Epstein’s 
pattern and practice. 
As the Court astutely acknowledged early on, “at the center of this case is the veracity of 
a contextual world of facts more broad than the allegedly defamatory statements . . . either 
transgression occurred or it did not. Either Maxwell was involved or she was not.” If Defendant 
was involved, then her January 2015 statement was defamatory. Ms. Giuffre will prove to the 
jury, through overwhelming evidence, her prior allegations about Defendant’s involvement. The 
Court should give Ms. Giuffre that opportunity, and deny Defendant’s motion for summary 
judgment. 
Ix. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Defendant’s motion for summary 
judgment in all respects.

L BACKGROUND 
A. Jeffrey Epstein’s Conviction and the CVRA Suit 


The origins of this case lie in a decade-old criminal proceeding 
against financier Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). On June 30, 2008, Epstein 
pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting, and procuring a 
person under the age of eighteen for, prostitution. The charges 
stemmed from sexual activity with privately hired “masseuses,” some 
of whom were under eighteen, Florida’s age of consent. Pursuant to 
an agreement with state and federal prosecutors, Epstein pleaded to 
the state charges. He received limited jail-time, registered as a sex 
offender, and agreed to pay compensation to his victims. In return, 


prosecutors declined to bring federal charges. 


Shortly after Epstein entered his plea, two of his victims, 
proceeding as “Jane Doe 1” and “Jane Doe 2,” filed suit against the 
Government in the Southern District of Florida under the Crime 


Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”). The victims sought to nullify the plea 


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page6 of 25 


agreement, alleging that the Government failed to fulfill its legal 
obligations to inform and consult with them in the process leading up 


to Epstein’s plea deal.! 


On December 30, 2014, two additional unnamed victims—one 
of whom has now self-identified as Plaintiff-Appellee Virginia Giuffre 
(“Giuffre”)— petitioned to join in the CVRA case. These petitioners 
included in their filings not only descriptions of sexual abuse by 
Epstein, but also new allegations of sexual abuse by several other 
prominent individuals, “including numerous prominent American 
politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well- 
known Prime Minister, and other world leaders,” as well as 
Dershowitz (a long-time member of the Harvard Law School faculty 
who had worked on Epstein’s legal defense) and Defendant-Appellee 
Ghislaine Maxwell (“Maxwell”).? 


Dershowitz moved to intervene, seeking to “strike the 
outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and to 
request a show cause order to the attorneys that have made them.” 


Exercising its authority to “strike from a pleading an insufficient 


! On February 21, 2019, the Florida District Court ruled that federal 
prosecutors had violated the CVRA by failing to adequately notify the two victims- 
plaintiffs of the plea deal. The District Court has not yet determined the appropriate

defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous 
matter... on its own,” the Florida District Court (Kenneth A. Marra, 
Judge) sua sponte struck all allegations against additional parties from 
the pleadings, including those against Dershowitz, and therefore 


denied Dershowitz’s motion as moot.> 


The stricken allegations, however, quickly found their way into 
the press, and several media outlets published articles repeating 
Giuffre’s accusations. In response to the allegations, on January 3, 
2015, Maxwell’s publicist issued a press statement declaring that 
Giuffre’s allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue” and that 


her “claims are obvious lies.’”° 
B. Giuffre Sues Maxwell 


On September 21, 2015, Giuffre filed the underlying action 
against Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. Giuffre alleged 
that Maxwell had defamed her through this and other public 
statements. Extensive and hard-fought discovery followed. Due to the 
volume of sealing requests filed during discovery, on August 9, 2016, 
the District Court entered a Sealing Order that effectively ceded 
control of the sealing process to the parties themselves. The Sealing 
Order disposed of the requirement that the parties file individual letter 


briefs to request sealing and prospectively granted all of the parties’

future sealing requests. In total, 167 documents—nearly one-fifth of 
the docket—were filed under seal. These sealed documents include, 
inter alia, motions to compel discovery, motions for sanctions and 


adverse inferences, motions in limine, and similar material. 


On January 6, 2017, Maxwell filed a motion for summary 
judgment. The parties submitted their memoranda of law and 
supporting exhibits contesting this motion under seal. On March 22, 
2017, the District Court denied the motion in a heavily redacted 76- 
page opinion. Once again, the entire summary judgment record, 
including the unredacted version of the District Court opinion 
denying summary judgment, remained under seal. On May 24, 2017, 
Maxwell and Giuffre executed a settlement agreement, and the case 


was closed the next day. 
C. Motions to Intervene and Unseal 


Over the course of the litigation before Judge Sweet, three 
outside parties attempted to unseal some or all of the sealed material. 
On August 11, 2016, Dershowitz moved to intervene, seeking to unseal 
three documents that, he argues, demonstrate that Giuffre invented 
the accusations against him. On January 19, 2017, Cernovich, an 
independent blogger and_ self-described “popular political 
journalist,”? moved to intervene, seeking to unseal the summary 
judgment record, and Dershowitz joined his motion. On April 6, 2018, 


after the case had settled, the Herald moved to intervene and unseal 


7 Br. Appellant (Cernovich) 4. 


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page9 of 25 


the entire docket. The District Court granted each of these motions to 
intervene, but denied the related requests to unseal in orders entered 
November 2, 2016, May 3, 2017, and August 27, 2018, respectively. 


The Appellants timely appealed from each of the orders 
denying their respective motions to unseal. Although each Appellant 
seeks the release of a different set of documents, all argue that the 
District Court failed to analyze the documents individually or 
properly apply the presumption of public access to court documents. 
We therefore ordered that the appeals be heard in tandem and held 
argument on March 6, 2019. 


On March 11, 2019, we issued an order to show cause why we 
“should not unseal the summary judgment motion, including any 
materials filed in connection with this motion, and the District Court’s 
summary judgment decision.”® The parties timely filed their 


responses. 
II. | DISCUSSION 


There are two categories of sealed material at issue in these 
appeals: (1) the summary judgment record, which includes the parties’ 
summary judgment briefs, their statements of undisputed facts, and 
incorporated exhibits; and (2) court filings made in the course of the 
discovery process and with respect to motions in limine. In this 


Opinion, we explain that our law requires the unsealing of the 


8 Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 18-2868-cv, Docket No. 138. 


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page10 of 25 


summary judgment materials and individualized review of the 


remaining sealed materials. 


While the law governing public access to these materials is 
largely settled, we have not yet adequately addressed the potential 
harms that often accompany such access. These harms are apparent. 
Over forty years ago, the Supreme Court observed that, without 
vigilance, courts’ files might “become a vehicle for improper 
purposes.”? Our legal process is already susceptible to abuse. 
Unscrupulous litigants can weaponize the discovery process to 
humiliate and embarrass their adversaries. Shielded by the “litigation 
privilege,”!" bad actors can defame opponents in court pleadings or 
depositions without fear of lawsuit and liability. Unfortunately, the 
presumption of public access to court documents has the potential to 
exacerbate these harms to privacy and reputation by ensuring that 


damaging material irrevocably enters the public record. 


We therefore take the opportunity to describe the tools available 
to district courts in protecting the integrity of the judicial process, and 
emphasize the courts’ responsibility to exercise these powerful tools. 
We also caution the public to critically assess allegations contained in 


judicial pleadings.

A. Standard of Review 


When reviewing a district court’s decision to seal a filing or 
maintain such a seal, “we examine the court's factual findings for clear 
error, its legal determinations de novo, and its ultimate decision to seal 


or unseal for abuse of discretion.””!! 
B. The Summary Judgment Materials 


With respect to the first category of materials, it is well-settled 
that “documents submitted to a court for its consideration in a 
summary judgment motion are—as a matter of law—judicial 
documents to which a strong presumption of access attaches, under 
both the common law and the First Amendment.”? In light of this 
strong First Amendment presumption, “continued sealing of the 
documents may be justified only with specific, on-the-record findings 
that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the 


sealing order is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim.” 


" Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139 
(2d Cir. 2016). 


? Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir. 2006). We 
observe that our holding in Lugosch relies on the general principle that parties may 
“be assumed to have supported their papers with admissible evidence and non- 
frivolous arguments.” Id. at 122. Insofar as a district court has, through striking a 
filing, specifically found that assumption inapplicable, the categorical rule in 
Lugosch may not apply. See notes 42-43 and accompanying text, post. 


13 Id. at 124. Examples of such countervailing values may include, 
depending on the circumstances, preserving “the right of an accused to 
fundamental fairness in the jury selection process,” Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court

Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page12 of 25 


In this case, the District Court erred in several respects." First, it 
failed to give proper weight to the presumption of access that attaches 
to documents filed in connection with summary judgment motions. 
The District Court reasoned that the summary judgment materials 
were “entitled to a lesser presumption of access” because “summary 
judgment was denied by the Court.” In assigning a “lesser 
presumption” to such materials, the District Court relied on a single 
sentence of dicta from our decision in United States v. Amodeo.'* We 
have since clarified, however, that this sentence was based on a 
“quotation from a partial concurrence and partial dissent in the D.C. 
Circuit .. . [and] is thus not the considered decision of either this court 
or the D.C. Circuit.” In fact, we have expressly rejected the 


proposition that “different types of documents might receive different 


of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984); the protection of attorney-client 
privilege, Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 125; “the danger of impairing law enforcement or 
judicial efficiency,” SEC. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232 (2d Cir. 2001); and “the 
privacy interest of those who resist disclosure,” id. 


4 Our discussion here focuses specifically on the District Court's denial of 
the Herald’s motion to unseal the entire record. Because this decision grants relief 
to all Appellants, we need not discuss any separate, additional error in the District 
Court's denial of the earlier motions to unseal.

of Columbia Circuit] has pointed out, for example, that where a district court 
denied the summary judgment motion, essentially postponing a final determination 
of substantive legal rights, the public interest in access is not as pressing.” (internal 
quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original)).

weights of presumption based on the extent to which they were relied 


upon in resolving [a] motion [for summary judgment].” 


Second, in contravention of our precedent, the District Court 
failed to review the documents individually and produce “specific, on- 
the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher 
values.”!° Instead, the District Court made generalized statements 


about the record as a whole.” This too was legal error. 


Finally, upon reviewing the summary judgment materials in 
connection with this appeal, we find that there is no countervailing 
privacy interest sufficient to justify their continued sealing. Remand 
with respect to these documents is thus unnecessary. Accordingly, and 
to avoid any further delay,?' we order that the summary judgment 
documents (with minimal redactions) be unsealed upon issuance of 


our mandate.”

that those allegations “establish{] a strong privacy interest here”).

C. The Remaining Sealed Materials 


The law governing disclosure of the remaining sealed material 
in this case is only slightly more complex. The Supreme Court has 
recognized a qualified right “to inspect and copy judicial records and 
documents.”? In defining “judicial records and documents,” we have 
emphasized that “the mere filing of a paper or document with the 
court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial document subject to 
the right of public access.” Instead, “the item filed must be relevant 
to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 


process in order for it to be designated a judicial document.” 


As our precedent makes clear, a court “perform[s] the judicial 
function” not only when it rules on motions currently before it, but 


also when properly exercising its inherent “supervisory powers.”?6 A 


security numbers. We have also redacted the names of alleged minor victims of 
sexual abuse from deposition testimony and police reports, as well as deposition 
responses concerning intimate matters where the questions were likely only 
permitted —and the responses only compelled —because of a strong expectation of 
continued confidentiality. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2. While we appreciate the views 
expressed in Judge Pooler’s separate opinion, the panel majority believes that the 
efforts invested by three former district judges in reviewing these materials 
adequately address those concerns.

26 Cf. United States v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 863 F.3d 125, 135 (2d Cir. 2017) 
(explaining that, in considering whether the report of a monitor charged with 
assessing compliance with a deferred prosecution agreement is a judicial 


14 


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page15 of 25 


document is thus “relevant to the performance of the judicial function” 
if it would reasonably have the tendency to influence a district court’s 
ruling on a motion or in the exercise of its supervisory powers, without 
regard to which way the court ultimately rules or whether the 
document ultimately in fact influences the court’s decision.” 
Accordingly, if in applying these standards, a court determines that 
documents filed by a party are not relevant to the performance of a 


judicial function, no presumption of public access attaches.” 


Once an item is deemed relevant to the exercise of judicial 
power, “the weight to be given the presumption of access must be 
governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of Article 


III judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those 


document, “[i]f the district court’s conception of its supervisory power in this 
context were correct, the Monitor’s Report would quite obviously be relevant to the 
performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process” (internal 
quotation marks omitted)). Whether a specific judicial decision constitutes a 
“performance of the judicial function” is a question of law. Accordingly, we review 
such determinations de novo. Id. at 134. 


27 Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145-46 (concluding that documents were relevant to 
the performance of a judicial function because they would have “informed” the 
district court’s decision whether to discharge or retain a Receiver); see also FTC. v. 
Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 409 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing Federal Rule of 
Evidence 401’s “having any tendency” definition of relevance in determining 
whether documents were “judicial documents”). 


2s As we explain below, there are several (often preferable) tools beyond 
sealing that district courts can use to protect their dockets from becoming a vehicle 
for irrelevant—and potentially defamatory —accusations. See Section D, post. 


15 


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page16 of 25 


monitoring the federal courts.””? Thus, while evidence introduced at 
trial or in connection with summary judgment enjoys a strong 
presumption of public access, documents that “play only a negligible 
role in the performance of Article III duties” are accorded only a low 
presumption that “amounts to little more than a prediction of public 
access absent a countervailing reason.”*° Documents that are never 
filed with the court, but simply “passed between the parties in 


discovery, lie entirely beyond the presumption’s reach.”*! 


The remaining sealed materials at issue here include filings 
related to, inter alia, motions to compel testimony, to quash trial 
subpoenae, and to exclude certain deposition testimony. All such 
motions, at least on their face, call upon the court to exercise its Article 
III powers. Moreover, erroneous judicial decision-making with respect 
to such evidentiary and discovery matters can cause substantial harm. 
Such materials are therefore of value “to those monitoring the federal 
courts.”%2 Thus, all documents submitted in connection with, and 
relevant to, such judicial decision-making are subject to at least some 


presumption of public access.

30 Id. at 1050. 

Id. 

* Id. at 1049. 


% In previous decisions, we have identified an important exception to this 
general rule: the presumption of public access does not apply to material that is 
submitted to the court solely so that the court may decide whether that same 


16 


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page17 of 25 


Although a court’s authority to oversee discovery and control 
the evidence introduced at trial surely constitutes an exercise of 
judicial power, we note that this authority is ancillary to the court’s 
core role in adjudicating a case. Accordingly, the presumption of 
public access in filings submitted in connection with discovery 
disputes or motions in lintine is generally somewhat lower than the 
presumption applied to material introduced at trial, or in connection 
with dispositive motions such as motions for dismissal or summary 
judgment.* Thus, while a court must still articulate specific and 
substantial reasons for sealing such material, the reasons usually need 
not be as compelling as those required to seal summary judgment 


filings. 


Here, the precise basis for the District Court’s decision to deny 
the motion to unseal these remaining materials is unclear. In the three 
paragraphs devoted to the issue, the District Court emphasized the 
potential for embarrassment “given the highly sensitive nature of the 
underlying allegations,” and concluded that “the documents sealed in 
the course of discovery were neither relied upon by [the District] Court 
in the rendering of an adjudication, nor necessary to or helpful in 
resolving a motion.”* It is therefore unclear whether the District Court 


held that these materials were not judicial documents (and thus are 
material must be disclosed in the discovery process or shielded by a Protective 
Order. See TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233.

not subject to a presumption of public access), or found that privacy 


interests outweighed a limited right of public access. 


On either interpretation, however, the District Court’s holding 
was error. Insofar as the District Court held that these materials are not 
judicial documents because it did not rely on them in adjudicating a 
motion, this was legal error. As explained above, the proper inquiry is 
whether the documents are relevant to the performance of the judicial 
function, not whether they were relied upon. Indeed, decision- 
makers often find that a great deal of relevant material does not 
ultimately sway their decision. And insofar as the District Court held 
that privacy interests outweigh the presumption of public access in 
each of the thousands of pages at issue, that decision— which appears 
to have been made without particularized review—amounts to an 


abuse of discretion.%” 


In light of the District Court’s failure to conduct an 
individualized review of the sealed materials, it is necessary to do so 
now. We believe the District Court is best situated to conduct this 
review. The District Court can directly communicate with the parties, 
and can therefore more swiftly and thoroughly consider particular 
objections to unsealing specific materials. Relatedly, the District Court 
can obtain the parties’ assistance in effecting any necessary redactions, 


and in notifying any outside parties whose privacy interests might be

implicated by the unsealing. Accordingly, we remand the cause to the 
District Court to conduct such a particularized review and unseal all 
documents for which the presumption of public access outweighs any 


countervailing privacy interests. 
D. Protecting the Integrity of Judicial Proceedings 


While we disagree with the District Court’s disposition of the 
motions to unseal, we share its concern that court files might be used 
to “promote scandal arising out of unproven potentially libelous 
statements.”°° We therefore describe certain methods courts can 
employ to protect the judicial process from being coopted for such 


purposes. 


The Supreme Court has explained that “[e]very court has 
supervisory power over its own records and files” to ensure they “are 
not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal” or “serve 
as reservoirs of libelous statements for press consumption.”*? This 
supervisory function is not only within a district court’s power, but 


also among its responsibilities. 


In practice, district courts may employ several methods to fulfill 
this function. They may, for instance, issue protective orders 
forbidding dissemination of certain material “to protect a party or 


person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue

burden” and require that filings containing such material be submitted 
under seal.” If parties then seek to file such materials, the court may 
deny them leave to do so.*! District courts may also seek to counteract 
the effect of defamatory statements by explaining on the record that 
the statements appear to lack credibility. Moreover, under Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), the district court may strike such 
material from the filings on the grounds that it is “redundant, 
immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous.”*? Because such rejected or 
stricken material is not “relevant to the performance of the judicial 
function” it would not be considered a “judicial document” and would 


enjoy no presumption of public access.# Finally, in appropriate

“on its own” or “on motion made by a party.” Id. Although motions to strike 
material solely “on the ground that the matter is impertinent and immaterial” are 
disfavored, when material is also “scandalous,” no such presumption applies. Cf.

circumstances, district courts may impose sanctions on attorneys and 


parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c).## 
E. A Cautionary Note 


We conclude with a note of caution to the public regarding the 


reliability of court filings such as those unsealed today. 


Materials submitted by parties to a court should be understood 
for what they are. They do not reflect the court’s own findings. Rather, 
they are prepared by parties seeking to advance their own interests in 
an adversarial process. Although affidavits and depositions are 
offered “under penalty of perjury,” it is in fact exceedingly rare for 


anyone to be prosecuted for perjury in a civil proceeding.* Similarly, 


“In relevant part, Rule 11 provides: 


By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper... an 
attorney or unrepresented party certifies that . . . it is not being presented 
for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or 


needlessly increase the cost of litigation . . . . [T]he court may impose an 
appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the 
tule or is responsible for the violation . . . . The sanction may include 


nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed 
on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing 
payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney’s fees and 
other expenses directly resulting from the violation. 


Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. See also Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1049 (describing sanctions available 
to the court).

pleadings, complaints, and briefs—while supposedly based on 
underlying evidentiary material —can be misleading. Such documents 
sometimes draw dubious inferences from already questionable 


material or present ambiguous material as definitive. 


Moreover, court filings are, in some respects, particularly 
susceptible to fraud. For while the threat of defamation actions may 
deter malicious falsehoods in standard publications, this threat is non- 
existent with respect to certain court filings. This is so because, under 
New York law (which governs the underlying defamation claim here), 
“absolute immunity from liability for defamation exists for oral or 
written statements made . . . in connection with a proceeding before a 
court.” Thus, although the act of filing a document with a court might 
be thought to lend that document additional credibility, in fact, 
allegations appearing in such documents might be less credible than 


those published elsewhere.”

F.3d 664, 666 (2d Cir. 2007) (adopting the reasoning of the District Court explaining 
that this privilege is “the broadest of possible privileges”); Restatement (Second) of 
Torts § 587 (1977) (“A party to a private litigation or a private prosecutor or 
defendant in a criminal prosecution is absolutely privileged to publish defamatory 
matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial 
proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course and as a part of, a judicial 
proceeding in which he participates, if the matter has some relation to the 
proceeding.”). But see note 47, post. 


*” While common law courts have generally interpreted the litigation privilege 
broadly, they nevertheless maintain an important (if rarely implemented) 
limitation on its scope: to qualify for the privilege, a statement must be “material 
and pertinent to the questions involved.” Front, 24 N.Y.3d at 718 (quoting Youmans

We have long noted that the press plays a vital role in ensuring 
the public right of access and in enhancing “the quality and safeguards 
the integrity of the factfinding process.’”** When faithfully observing 
its best traditions, the print and electronic media “contributes to public 
understanding of the rule of law” and “validates [its] claim of 


functioning as surrogates for the public.’ 


At the same time, the media does the public a profound 
disservice when it reports on parties’ allegations uncritically. We have 
previously observed that courts cannot possibly “discredit every 
statement or document turned up in the course of litigation,” and we 
have criticized “the use by the media of the somewhat misleading term 


‘court records’ in referring to such items.”°? Even ordinarily critical 


v. Smith, 153 N.Y. 214, 219-20 (1897)). It follows, then, that immaterial and 
impertinent statements are (at least nominally) actionable, particularly when they 
are “so needlessly defamatory as to warrant the inference of express malice.” Id. 
(same). It seems to us that when a district court strikes statements from the record 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) on the ground that the matter is “impertinent” and 
“immaterial,” it makes the very same determination that permits a defamation 
action under the common law. We think the judicial system would be well served 
were our common law courts to revitalize this crucial qualification to the litigation 
privilege.

readers may take the reference to “court papers” as some sort of 


marker of reliability. This would be a mistake. 


We therefore urge the media to exercise restraint in covering 
potentially defamatory allegations, and we caution the public to read 


such accounts with discernment. 
III. CONCLUSION 
To summarize, we hold as follows: 


(1) Materials submitted in connection with a motion for 
summary judgment are subject to a strong presumption of 


public access. 


(2) The summary judgment record at issue will be unsealed 
upon issuance of our mandate, subject to minimal 


redactions.*! 


(3) Materials submitted in connection with, and relevant to, 
discovery motions, motions in limine, and other non- 
dispositive motions are subject to a lesser—but still 


substantial— presumption of public access. 


(4) The District Court is directed to review the remaining sealed 
materials individually and unseal those materials as 


appropriate.

24 


Case 18-2868, Document 273-2, 08/09/2019, 2628218, Page25 of 25 


(5) District courts should exercise the full range of their 
substantial powers to ensure their files do not become 


vehicles for defamation. 


For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the orders of the 
District Court entered on November 2, 2016, May 3, 2017, and August 
27, 2018, ORDER the unsealing of the summary judgment record as 
described herein, and REMAND the cause to the District Court for 


particularized review of the remaining materials. 


In undertaking this task, the District Court may be well-served 
by ordering the parties to submit to the Court unredacted, electronic 
copies of the remaining sealed materials, as well as specific, proposed 
redactions. The District Court may also order the parties to identify 
and notify additional parties whose privacy interests would likely be 


implicated by disclosure of these materials. 


In the interests of judicial economy, any future appeal in this 


matter shall be referred to this panel.

POOLER, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part: 

Ijoin the Court’s opinion in every respect but one: the decision to unseal 
the summary judgment record ourselves. I agree that all or most of the material 
must be unsealed. Nevertheless, in my view, the district court is better suited to 
the task. As the Court’s opinion recognizes in connection with the remaining 
sealed materials, the district court is better positioned to communicate with the 
parties and any nonparties whose privacy interests might be affected by 
unsealing. On that score, it is worth clarifying here the breadth of the Court’s 
unsealing order: it unseals nearly 2000 pages of material. The task of identifying 
and making specific redactions in such a substantial volume is perilous; the 
consequences of even a seemingly minor error may be grave and are irrevocable. 
Moreover, although I share the majority’s concern about avoiding delay, I would 
alleviate that concern through other means—perhaps with an order directing the 
district court to act expeditiously and by making clear what types of limited 
redactions are and are not appropriate. In sum, I would unseal the district court's 
summary judgment decision only and leave the remainder of the materials for 


the district court to review, redact, and unseal on remand.

Pursuant to Rule 56.1 of the Local Civil Rules of this Court, defendant Ghislaine 
Maxwell submits this statement of the material facts as to which she contends there is no genuine 
issues to be tried. Ms. Maxwell expressly preserves all of her objections to the admissibility of 
the evidence cited herein and in the accompanying memoranda of law and does not waive any 
objections by making this submission. 

numbered. 

1. Ms. Maxwell’s response to publications of plaintiff’s false allegations: the 
March 2011 statement. In early 2011 plaintiff in two British tabloid interviews made numerous 
false and defamatory allegations against Ms. Maxwell. In the articles, plaintiff made no direct 
allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in any improper conduct with Jeffrey Epstein, who 
had pleaded guilty in 2007 to procuring a minor for prostitution. Nonetheless, plaintiff suggested 
that Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein and may have known about the crime for which he was 
convicted. 

2. In the articles, plaintiff alleged she had sex with Prince Andrew, “a well-known 
businessman,” a “world-renowned scientist,” a “respected liberal politician,” and a “foreign head 
of state.” 

3. In response to the allegations Ms. Maxwell’s British attorney, working with 
Mr. Gow, issued a statement on March 9, 2011, denying “the various allegations about 
[Ms. Maxwell] that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false.” 

4. The statement read in full: 


Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell 


By Devonshires Solicitors, PRNE 
Wednesday, March 9, 2011 


London, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about 
her that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely 
false. 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page3 of 18 


It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell’s legal representatives to 
certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be 
withdrawn have simply been ignored. 


In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against 
those newspapers. 


“T understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain 
newspapers live by the adage, “why let the truth get in the way of a good story.” 
However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and 
Lask that they stop,” said Ghislaine Maxwell. 


“A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their 
reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation 
or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name,” she said.

5. Plaintiff’s gratuitous and “lurid” accusations in an unrelated action. In 2008 two 
alleged victims of Epstein brought an action under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act against the 
United States government purporting to challenge Epstein’s plea agreement. They alleged the 
government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the agreement. 

6. Seven years later, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA 
action, claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January 1, 2015, 
Ms. Giuffre filed a “corrected” joinder motion. 

7. The issue presented in her joinder motion was narrow: whether she should be 
permitted to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21, 
specifically, whether she was a “known victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed them 
CVRA duties.” Yet, “the bulk of the [motion] consists of copious factual details that [plaintiff] 
and [her co-movant] ‘would prove . . . if allowed to join.” Ms. Giuffre gratuitously included 


2 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page4 of 18 


provocative and “lurid details” of her alleged sexual activities as an alleged victim of sexual 
trafficking. 

8. At the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew that the media 
had been following the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately filed 
the motion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre’s name, claiming the need for privacy and secrecy, 
they made no attempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they filed the motion 
publicly. 

9. As the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre “name[d] 
several individuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they 
took place.” The court ruled that “these lurid details are unnecessary”: “The factual details 
regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and 
impertinent . . ., especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related 
to the respondent Government.” Accordingly, “[t]hese unnecessary details shall be stricken.” Id. 
The court then struck all Ms. Giuffre’s factual allegations relating to her alleged sexual activities 
and her allegations of misconduct by non-parties. The court said the striking of the “lurid details” 
was a sanction for Ms. Giuffre’s improper inclusion of them in the motion. 

10. The district court found not only that the “lurid details” were unnecessary but also 
that the entire joinder motion was “entirely unnecessary.” Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew the 
motion with all its “lurid details” was unnecessary because the motion itself recognized that she 
would be able to participate as a fact witness to achieve the same result she sought as a party. 
The court denied plaintiff's joinder motion. 

11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was 


Ms. Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Paged of 18 


Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by 


Epstein: 


Ms. Maxwell “approached” plaintiff in 1999 when plaintiff was “fifteen years 
old” to recruit her into the scheme. 


Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under- 
aged girls for sexual activities.” 


Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. 


She “persuaded” plaintiff to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar 
to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of 
other children.” 


At the mansion, when plaintiff began giving Epstein a massage, he and 
Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” 


Epstein “with the assistance of’ Ms. Maxwell “converted [plaintiff] into ...a 
“sex slave.’” Id. Plaintiff was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” 


Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” 


Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea 
agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes 
she committed in Florida.” 


Ms. Maxwell “participat[ed] in the sexual abuse of [plaintiff] and others.” 


Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls 
involved in sexual activities, including [plaintiff].” Jd. She shared the photos 
with Epstein. 


As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect[ed]” 
Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffick plaintiff to 
these persons. 


Plaintiff was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in 
“TMs. Maxwell’s] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” plaintiff's 
sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” 


Ms. Maxwell “assist[ed] in internationally trafficking” plaintiff and “numerous 
other young girls for sexual purposes.” 


Plaintiff was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in 
illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.” 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page6 of 18 


12. In the joinder motion, plaintiff also alleged she was “forced” to have sex with 
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, “model scout” Jean Luc Brunel, and “many other 
powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business 
executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” 

13. Plaintiff said after serving for four years as a “sex slave,” she “managed to escape to 
a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years.” 

14. Plaintiff suggested the government was part of Epstein’s “conspiracy” when it 
“secretly” negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Eptstein precluding federal prosecution 
of Epstein and his “co-conspirators.” The government’s secrecy, plaintiff alleged, was motivated 
by its fear that plaintiff would raise “powerful objections” to the agreement that would have 
“shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other powerful individuals. 

15. Notably, the other “Jane Doe” who joined plaintiff's motion who alleged she was 
sexually abused “many occasions” by Epstein was unable to corroborate any of plaintiff's 
allegations. 

16. Also notably, in her multiple and lengthy consensual interviews with Ms. Churcher 
three years earlier, plaintiff told Ms. Churcher of virtually none of the details she described in the 
joinder motion. 

17. Ms. Maxwell’s response to plaintiff’s “lurid” accusations: the January 2015 
statement. As plaintiff and her lawyers expected, before District Judge Marra in the CVRA 
action could strike the “lurid details” of plaintiff's allegations in the joinder motion, members of 
the media obtained copies of the motion. 

18. At Mr. Barden’s direction, on January 3, 2015, Mr. Gow sent to numerous 


representatives of British media organizations an email containing “a quotable statement on 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page7 of 18 


behalf of Ms Maxwell.” The email was sent to more than 6 and probably less than 30 media 


representatives. It was not sent to non-media representatives. 


19. Among the media representatives were Martin Robinson of the Daily Mail; P. 


Peachey of The Independent; Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror; David Brown of The Times; and 


Nick Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC; and David Mercer of the Press Association. These 


representatives were selected based on their request—after the joinder motion was filed—for a 


response from Ms. Maxwell to plaintiff's allegations in the motion. 


20. The email to the media members read: 


To Whom It May Concern, 
Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell. 


No further communication will be provided by her on this matter. 
Thanks for your understanding. 

Best

ACUITY Reputation 


Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts—so not a new individual. The allegations made by 
Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations 
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 


Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about 
public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that 
Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he 
denies. 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not 
publicised as news, as they are defamatory. 


Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains 
the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which 
have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek 
redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims. 


21. Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend it as a 


traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media. So he intentionally did 


not pass it through a public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow’s firm, Acuity Reputation. 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page8 of 18 


22. The January 2015 statement served two purposes. First, Mr. Barden intended that it 
mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation from the press’s republication of plaintiff's false 
allegations. He believed these ends could be accomplished by suggesting to the media that, 
among other things, they should subject plaintiff's allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. For 
example, he noted in the statement that plaintiff's allegations changed dramatically over time, 
suggesting that they are “obvious lies” and therefore should not be “publicised as news.” 

23. Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be “a shot across the 
bow” of the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations 
without conducting any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly noted 
that plaintiff's allegations were “defamatory.” In this sense, the statement was intended as a 
cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the 
seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false 
allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. 

24. Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow’s emails prefaced the statement with 
the following language: “Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell” 
(emphasis supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-time-only, comprehensive 
response—quoted in full—to plaintiff's December 30, 2014, allegations that would give the 
media Ms. Maxwell’s response. The purpose of the prefatory statement was to inform the media- 
recipients of this intent. 

25. Plaintiff’s activities to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. 
Plaintiff has engaged in numerous activities to bring attention to herself, to the prosecution and 
punishment of wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest of bringing light 


to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page9 of 18 


26. Plaintiff created an organization, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida corporation, 
directly related to her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse. 

27. The “goal” of Victims Refuse Silence “was, and continues to be, to help survivors 
surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse.” 
Toward this end, plaintiff has “dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex 
trafficking.” 

28. Plaintiff repeatedly has sought out media organizations to discuss her alleged 
experience as a victim of sexual abuse. 

29. On December 30, 2014, plaintiff publicly filed an “entirely unnecessary” joinder 
motion laden with “unnecessary,” “lurid details” about being “sexually abused” as a “minor 
victim[]” by wealthy and famous men and being “trafficked” all around the world as a “sex 
slave.” 

30. The plaintiff's alleged purpose in filing the joinder motion was to “vindicate” her 
rights under the CVRA, expose the government’s “secretly negotiated” “non-prosecution 
agreement” with Epstein, “shed tremendous public light” on Epstein and “other powerful 
individuals” that would undermine the agreement, and support the CVRA plaintiffs’ request for 
documents that would show how Epstein “used his powerful political and social connections to 


secure a favorable plea deal” and the government’s “motive” to aid Epstein and his “co- 
conspirators.” 
31. Plaintiff has written the manuscript of a book she has been trying to publish detailing 


her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse and of sex trafficking in Epstein’s alleged “sex 


scheme.” 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page10 of 18 


32. Republication alleged by plaintiff. Plaintiff was required by Interrogatory No. 6 to 
identify any false statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell that were “‘published globally, including 
within the Southern District of New York,” as plaintiff alleged in Paragraph 9 of Count I of her 
complaint. In response, plaintiff identified the January 2015 statement and nine instances in 
which various news media published portions of the January 2015 statement in news articles or 
broadcast stories. 

33. In none of the nine instances was there any publication of the entire January 2015 
statement. 

34. Ms. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or authority over any media 
organization, including the media identified in plaintiffs response to Interrogatory No. 6, in 
connection with the media’s publication of portions of the January 2015 statement. 

35. Plaintiff’s defamation action against Ms. Maxwell. Eight years after Epstein’s 
guilty plea, plaintiff brought this action, repeating many of the allegations she made in her 
CVRA joinder motion. 

36. The complaint alleged that the January 2015 statement “contained the following 
deliberate falsehoods”: 

(a) That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” 
(b) That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.” 
(c) That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.” 

37. Plaintiff lived independently from her parents with her fiancé long before 
meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. After leaving the Growing Together drug rehabilitation 
facility in 1999, plaintiff moved in with the family of a fellow patient. There she met, and 


became engaged to, her friend’s brother, James Michael Austrich. She and Austrich thereafter 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page11 of 18 


rented an apartment in the Ft. Lauderdale area with another friend and both worked at various 
jobs in that area. Later, they stayed briefly with plaintiff's parents in the Palm Beach/ 
Loxahatchee, Florida area before Austrich rented an apartment for the couple on Bent Oak Drive 
in Royal Palm Beach. Although plaintiff agreed to marry Austrich, she never had any intention 
of doing so. 

38. Plaintiff re-enrolled in high school from June 21, 2000 until March 7, 2002. 
After finishing the 9" grade school year at Forest Hills High School on June 9, 1999, plaintiff re- 
enrolled at Wellington Adult High School on June 21, 2000, again on August 16, 2000 and on 
August 14, 2001. On September 20, 2001, Plaintiff then enrolled at Royal Palm Beach High 
School. A few weeks later, on October 12, 2001, she matriculated at Survivors Charter School. 
Id. Survivor’s Charter School was an alternative school designed to assist students who had been 
unsuccessful at more traditional schools. Plaintiff remained enrolled at Survivor’s Charter School 
until March 7, 2002. She was present 56 days and absent 13 days during her time there. Id. 
Plaintiff never received her high school diploma or GED. Plaintiff and Figueroa went “back to 
school” together at Survivor’s Charter School. The school day there lasted from morning until 
early afternoon. 

39. During the year 2000, plaintiff worked at numerous jobs. In 2000, while living 
with her fiancé, plaintiff held five different jobs: at Aviculture Breeding and Research Center, 
Southeast Employee Management Company, The Club at Mar-a-Lago, Oasis Outsourcing, and 
Neiman Marcus. Her taxable earnings that year totaled nearly $9,000. Plaintiff cannot now recall 
either the Southeast Employee Management Company or the Oasis Outsourcing jobs. 

40. Plaintiff’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2000. Plaintiff's 


father, Sky Roberts, was hired as a maintenance worker at the The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page12 of 18 


Beach, Florida, beginning on April 11, 2000. Mr. Roberts worked there year-round for 
approximately 3 years. After working there for a period of time, Mr. Roberts became acquainted 
with the head of the spa area and recommended plaintiff for a job there. Mar-a-Lago closes every 
Mother’s Day and reopens on November |. Most of employees Mar-a-Lago, including all 
employees of the spa area such as “spa attendants,” are “seasonal” and work only when the club 
is open, i.e., between November | and Mother’s Day. Plaintiff was hired as a “seasonal” spa 
attendant to work at the Mar-a-Lago Club in the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17. 

41. Plaintiff represented herself as a masseuse for Jeffrey Epstein. While working at 
the Mar-a-Lago spa and reading a library book about massage, plaintiff met Ms. Maxwell. 
Plaintiff thereafter told her father that she got a job working for Jeffrey Epstein as a masseuse. 
Plaintiff's father took her to Epstein’s house on one occasion around that time, and Epstein came 
outside and introduced himself to Mr. Roberts. Plaintiff commenced employment as a traveling 
masseuse for Mr. Epstein. Plaintiff was excited about her job as a masseuse, about traveling 
with him and about meeting famous people. Plaintiff represented that she was employed as a 
masseuse beginning in January 2001. Plaintiff never mentioned Ms. Maxwell to her then-fiancé, 
Austrich. Plaintiff's father never met Ms. Maxwell. 

42. Plaintiff resumed her relationship with convicted felon Anthony Figueroa. In 
spring 2001, while living with Austich, plaintiff lied to and cheated on him with her high school 
boyfriend, Anthony Figueroa. Plaintiff and Austrich thereafter broke up, and Figueroa moved 
into the Bent Oak apartment with plaintiff. When Austrich returned to the Bent Oak apartment to 
check on his pets and retrieve his belongings, Figueroa in Plaintiff's presence punched Austrich 
in the face. Figueroa and plaintiff fled the scene before police arrived. Figueroa was then a 


convicted felon and a drug abuser on probation for possession of a controlled substance. 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page13 of 18 


43. Plaintiff freely and voluntarily contacted the police to come to her aid in 2001 
and 2002 but never reported to them that she was Epstein’s “sex slave.” In August 2001 at 
age 17, while living in the same apartment, plaintiff and Figueroa hosted a party with a number 
of guests. During the party, according to plaintiff, someone entered plaintiff's room and stole 
$500 from her shirt pocket. Plaintiff contacted the police. She met and spoke with police officers 
regarding the incident and filed a report. She did not disclose to the officer that she was a “sex 
slave.” A second time, in June 2002, plaintiff contacted the police to report that her former 
landlord had left her belongings by the roadside and had lit her mattress on fire. Again, plaintiff 
met and spoke with the law enforcement officers but did not complain that she was the victim of 
any sexual trafficking or abuse or that she was then being held as a “‘sex slave.” 

44. From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein and Maxwell were almost 
entirely absent from Florida on documented travel unaccompanied by Plaintiff. Flight logs 
maintained by Epstein’s private pilot Dave Rodgers evidence the substantial number of trips 
away from Florida that Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Plaintiff, between August 
2001 and September 2002. Rodgers maintained a log of all flights on which Epstein and 
Maxwell traveled with him. Epstein additionally traveled with another pilot who did not keep 
such logs and he also occasionally traveled via commercial flights. For substantially all of 
thirteen months of the twenty-two months (from November 2000 until September 2002) that 
Plaintiff lived in Palm Beach and knew Epstein, Epstein was traveling outside of Florida 
unaccompanied by Plaintiff. During this same period of time, Plaintiff was employed at various 
jobs, enrolled in school, and living with her boyfriend. 

45. Plaintiff and Figueroa shared a vehicle during 2001 and 2002. Plaintiff and 


Figueroa shared a ’93 white Pontiac in 2001 and 2002. Plaintiff freely traveled around the Palm 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page14 of 18 


Beach area in that vehicle. In August 2002, Plaintiff acquired a Dodge Dakota pickup truck from 
her father. Figueroa used that vehicle in a series of crimes before and after Plaintiff left for 
Thailand. 

46. Plaintiff held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002. During 2001 and 2002, plaintiff 
was gainfully employed at several jobs. She worked as a waitress at Mannino’s Restaurant, at 
TGIFriday’s restaurant (aka CCI of Royal Palm Inc.), and at Roadhouse Grill. She also was 
employed at Courtyard Animal Hospital (aka Marc Pinkwasser DVM). 

47. In September 2002, Plaintiff traveled to Thailand to receive massage training 
and while there, met her future husband and eloped with him. Plaintiff traveled to Thailand 
in September 2002 to receive formal training as a masseuse. Figueroa drove her to the airport. 
While there, she initially contacted Figueroa frequently, incurring a phone bill of $4,000. She 
met Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and decided to marry him. She thereafter ceased all contact 
with Figueroa from October 2002 until two days before Mr. Figueroa’s deposition in this matter 
in May 2016. 

48. Detective Recarey’s investigation of Epstein failed to uncover any evidence that 
Ms. Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or 
possession of child pornography. Joseph Recarey served as the lead detective from the Palm 
Beach Police Department charged with investigating Jeffrey Epstein. That investigation 
commenced in 2005. Recarey worked only on the Epstein case for an entire year. He reviewed 
previous officers’ reports and interviews, conducted numerous interviews of witnesses and 
alleged victims himself, reviewed surveillance footage of the Epstein home, participated in and 
had knowledge of the search warrant executed on the Epstein home, and testified regarding the 


case before the Florida state grand jury against Epstein. Detective Recarey’s investigation 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page15 of 18 


revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever mentioned Ms. Maxwell’s name and she 
was never considered a suspect by the government. None of Epstein’s alleged victims said they 
had seen Ms. Maxwell at Epstein’s house, nor said they had been “recruited by her,” nor paid 
any money by her, nor told what to wear or how to act by her. Indeed, none of Epstein’s alleged 
victims ever reported to the government they had met or spoken to Ms. Maxwell. Maxwell was 
not seen coming or going from the house during the law enforcement surveillance of Epstein’s 
home. The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell and her name was never mentioned 
before the grand jury. No property belonging to Maxwell, including “sex toys” or “child 
pornography,” was seized from Epstein’s home during execution of the search warrant. Detective 
Recarey, when asked to describe “everything that you believe you know about Ghislaine 
Maxwell’s sexual trafficking conduct,” replied, “I don’t.” He confirmed he has no knowledge 
about Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking anybody. Detective Recarey also has no knowledge of 
Plaintiffs conduct that is subject of this lawsuit. 

49. No nude photograph of Plaintiff was displayed in Epstein’s home. Epstein’s 
housekeeper, Juan Alessi, “never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. Epstein’s 
house.” Detective Recarey entered Epstein’s home in 2002 to install security cameras to catch a 
thief and did not observe any “child pornography” within the home, including on Epstein’s desk 
in his office. 

50. Plaintiff intentionally destroyed her “journal” and “dream journal” regarding 
her “memories” of this case in 2013 while represented by counsel. Plaintiff drafted a 
“journal” describing individuals to whom she claims she was sexually trafficked as well as her 
memories and thoughts about her experiences with Epstein. In 2013, she and her husband created 


a bonfire in her backyard in Florida and burned the journal together with other documents in her 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page16 of 18 


possession. Jd. Plaintiff also kept a “dream journal” regarding her thoughts and memories that 
she possessed in January 2016. To date, Plaintiff cannot locate the “dream journal.” 

51. Plaintiff publicly peddled her story beginning in 2011. Plaintiff granted journalist 
Sharon Churcher extensive interviews that resulted in seven (7) widely distributed articles from 
March 2011 through January 2015. Churcher regularly communicated with plaintiff and her 
“attorneys or other agents” from “early 2011” to “the present day.” Plaintiff received 
approximately $160,000 for her stories and pictures that were published by many news 
organizations. 

52. Plaintiff drafted a 144-page purportedly autobiographical book manuscript in 
2011 which she actively sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous with her Churcher 
interviews, plaintiff drafted a book manuscript which purported to document plaintiff's 
experiences as a teenager in Florida, including her interactions with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Plaintiff communicated with literary agents, ghost writers and potential independent publishers 
in an effort to get her book published. She generated marketing materials and circulated those 
along with book chapters to numerous individuals associated with publishing and the media. 

53. Plaintiff’s publicly filed “lurid” CVRA pleadings initiated a media frenzy and 
generated highly publicized litigation between her lawyers and Alan Dershowitz. On 
December 30, 2014, plaintiff, through counsel, publicly filed a joinder motion that contained her 
“lurid allegations” about Ms. Maxwell and many others, including Alan Dershowitz, Prince 
Andrew, Jean-Luc Brunel. The joinder motion was followed by a “corrected” motion and two 
further declarations in January and February 2015, which repeated many of plaintiff's claims. 
These CVRA pleadings generated a media maelstrom and spawned highly publicized litigation 


between plaintiff's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz. After plaintiff publicly 


Case 18-2868, Document 275, 08/09/2019, 2628223, Page17 of 18 


alleged Mr. Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz vigorously defended himself in 
the media. He called plaintiff a liar and accused her lawyers of unethical conduct. In response, 
attorneys Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz who counterclaimed. This litigation, in turn, 
caused additional media attention by national and international media organizations. 

54. Plaintiff formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to attract publicity and 
speak out on a public controversy. In 2014, plaintiff, with the assistance of the same counsel, 
formed a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to plaintiff, the purpose of 
the organization is to promote plaintiff's professed cause against sex slavery. The stated goal of 
her organization is to help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically 
experienced by victims of sexual abuse. Plaintiff attempts to promote Victims Refuse Silence at 
every opportunity. For example, plaintiff participated in an interview in New York with ABC to 
promote the charity and to get her mission out to the public.

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 for 
summary judgment. 

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
FACTS 

The following facts are undisputed. Additional undisputed facts are set forth in specific 
argument sections. All paragraphs containing undisputed facts will be sequentially numbered. 

1. Ms. Maxwell’s response to publications of plaintiff’s false allegations: the 
March 2011 statement. In early 2011 plaintiff in two British tabloid interviews made numerous 
false and defamatory allegations against Ms. Maxwell. ExuiBITs A-B.' In the articles, plaintiff 
made no direct allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in any improper conduct with Jeffrey 
Epstein, who had pleaded guilty in 2007 to procuring a minor for prostitution.” Nonetheless, 
plaintiff suggested that Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein and may have known about the crime 
for which he was convicted. See generally EXHIBITS A-B. 

2. In the articles, plaintiff alleged she had sex with Prince Andrew, “a well-known 
businessman,” a “world-renowned scientist,” a “respected liberal politician,” and a “foreign head 
of state.” Id. at 5. 

3. In response to the allegations Ms. Maxwell’s British attorney, working with 
Mr. Gow, issued a statement on March 9, 2011, denying “the various allegations about 
[Ms. Maxwell] that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false.” 
EXHIBIT C, 

4. The statement read in full: 


'The articles were attached as exhibits to the author Sharon Churcher’s declaration in 
support of her motion to quash an SDT issued to her. See Doc.216-2 & 216-3.

Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell 
By Devonshires Solicitors, PRNE 
Wednesday, March 9, 2011 


London, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about 
her that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely 
false. 


It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms Maxwell’s legal representatives to 
certain newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be 
withdrawn have simply been ignored. 


In the circumstances, Ms Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against 
those newspapers. 


“T understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain 
newspapers live by the adage, “why let the truth get in the way of a good story.” 
However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and 
lask that they stop,” said Ghislaine Maxwell. 


“A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their 
reporting of this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation 
or any real due diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name,” she said.

EXHIBIT C (emphasis supplied; capitalization altered). We refer to this as “the March 2011 
statement.” 

5. Plaintiff’s gratuitous and “lurid” accusations in an unrelated action. In 2008 two 
alleged victims of Epstein brought an action under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act against the 
United States government purporting to challenge Epstein’s plea agreement. They alleged the 


government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the agreement. See EXHIBIT D, at 2. 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page10 of 77 


6. Seven years later, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA 
action, claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January 1, 2015, 
Ms. Giuffre filed a “corrected” joinder motion. EXHIBIT D, at 1, 9. 

7. The issue presented in her joinder motion was narrow: whether she should be 
permitted to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21, 
specifically, whether she was a “known victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed them 
CVRA duties,” EXHIBIT E, at 5. Yet, the court noted, “the bulk of the [motion] consists of 
copious factual details that [plaintiff] and [her co-movant] ‘would prove . . . if allowed to join.’”” 
Id. (brackets omitted). Ms. Giuffre gratuitously included provocative and “lurid details” of her 
alleged sexual activities as an alleged victim of sexual trafficking. Id. 

8. At the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew that the media 
had been following the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately filed 
the motion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre’s name, claiming the need for privacy and secrecy, 
they made no attempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they filed the motion 
publicly. ExHiBIT D, at 1 & n.1. 

9. As the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre “name[d] 
several individuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they 
took place.” EXHIBIT E, at 5. The court ruled that “these lurid details are unnecessary”: “The 
factual details regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are 
immaterial and impertinent . . ., especially considering that these details involve non-parties who 
are not related to the respondent Government.” Jd. Accordingly, “[t]hese unnecessary details 
shall be stricken.” Jd. The court then struck all Ms. Giuffre’s factual allegations relating to her 


alleged sexual activities and her allegations of misconduct by non-parties. /d. at 5-6. The court 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page11 of 77 


said the striking of the “lurid details” was a sanction for Ms. Giuffre’s improper inclusion of 
them in the motion. See id. at 6-7. 

10. The district court found not only that the “lurid details” were unnecessary but also 
that the entire joinder motion was “entirely unnecessary,” id. at 7. Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers 
knew the motion with all its “lurid details” was unnecessary because, as the court pointed out, 
the motion itself recognized that she would be able to participate as a fact witness to achieve the 
same result she sought as a party. See id. at 7-8; see also id. at 8 (noting that in the motion, Ms. 
Giuffre’s lawyers said that “regardless of whether this Court grants the . .. Motion, ‘they will 
call [her] as a witness at any trial’”). The court denied plaintiff's joinder motion. /d. at 10. 

11. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was 
Ms. Maxwell. EXHIBIT D, at 3-6. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the 
motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” 
created by Epstein: 


e Ms. Maxwell “approached” plaintiff in 1999 when plaintiff was “fifteen years 
old” to recruit her into the scheme. /d. at 3. 


e = Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under- 
aged girls for sexual activities.” Jd. 


e = Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. Jd. 
e She “persuaded” plaintiff to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar 
to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of 


other children.” Jd. 


e At the mansion, when plaintiff began giving Epstein a massage, he and 
Ms. Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” Jd. 


e Epstein “with the assistance of’ Ms. Maxwell “converted [plaintiff] into... a 
“sex slave.’” /d. Plaintiff was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” Jd. 


e Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” /d. at 4. 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page12 of 77 


e Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea 
agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes 
she committed in Florida.” Jd. 

e Ms. Maxwell “participat[ed] in the sexual abuse of [plaintiff] and others.” Jd. 

e = Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls 
involved in sexual activities, including [plaintiff].” Jd. She shared the photos 
with Epstein. Jd. 

e As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect[ed]” 
Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffick plaintiff to 
these persons. Id. 

e — Plaintiff was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in 
“[Ms. Maxwell's] apartment” in London. /d. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” 


plaintiff's sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” Jd. 


e Ms. Maxwell “assist[ed] in internationally trafficking” plaintiff and “numerous 
other young girls for sexual purposes.” Jd. 


e Plaintiff was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in 
illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.” Jd. 


12. In the joinder motion, plaintiff also alleged she was “forced” to have sex with 
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, “model scout” Jean Luc Brunel, and “many other 
powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business 
executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” Jd. at 4-6. 

13. Plaintiff said after serving for four years as a “sex slave,” she “managed to escape to 
a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years.” Id. at 3. 

14. Plaintiff suggested the government was part of Epstein’s “conspiracy” when it 
“secretly” negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding federal prosecution 
of Epstein and his “co-conspirators.” /d. at 6. The government’s secrecy, plaintiff alleged, was 
motivated by its fear that plaintiff would raise “powerful objections” to the agreement that would 


have “shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other powerful individuals. /d. at 6-7. 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page13 of 77 


15. Notably, the other “Jane Doe” who joined plaintiff's motion who alleged she was 
sexually abused “many occasions” by Epstein was unable to corroborate any of plaintiffs 
allegations. See id. at 7-8. 

16. Also notably, in her multiple and lengthy consensual interviews with Ms. Churcher 
three years earlier, plaintiff told Ms. Churcher virtually none of the details she described in the 
joinder motion. See EXHIBIT A-B. 

17. Ms. Maxwell’s response to plaintiff’s “lurid” accusations: the January 2015 
statement. As plaintiff and her lawyers expected, before District Judge Marra in the CVRA 
action could strike the “lurid details” of plaintiff's allegations in the joinder motion, members of 
the media obtained copies of the motion. See EXHIBIT G, at 31:2-36:4 & Depo.Exs.3-4. 

18. At Mr. Barden’s direction, on January 2, 2015, Mr. Gow sent to numerous 
representatives of British media organizations an email containing ‘‘a quotable statement on 
behalf of Ms Maxwell.” EXHIBIT F; EXHIBIT G, at 33:8-23. The email was sent to more than 6 
and probably less than 30 media representatives. See EXHIBIT G, at 33:8-34:3. It was not sent to 
non-media representatives. See id. at 31:2-35:21. 

19. Among the media representatives were Martin Robinson of the Daily Mail; P. 
Peachey of The Independent; Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror; David Brown of The Times; and 
Nick Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC; and David Mercer of the Press Association. See, 
e.g., EXHIBIT F. These representatives were selected based on their request—after the joinder 
motion was filed—for a response from Ms. Maxwell to plaintiff’s allegations in the motion. See, 
e.g., EXHIBIT G, at 30:23-35:21 & Depo.Ex.3. 

20. The email to the media members read: 


To Whom It May Concern, 
Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell. 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page14 of 77

ACUITY Reputation 


Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts—so not a new individual. The allegations made by 
Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations 
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 


Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about 
public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that 
Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he 
denies. 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not 
publicised as news, as they are defamatory. 


Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains 
the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which 
have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek 
redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims. 

EXHIBIT F (emphasis supplied). We refer to this email as “the January 2015 statement.” 

21. Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend it as a 
traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media. So he intentionally did 
engage a public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow’s firm Acuity Reputation, to prepare the 
statement. See EXHIBIT K ff 10,15. 

22. The January 2015 statement served two purposes. First, Mr. Barden intended that it 
mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation from the press’s republication of plaintiff's false 
allegations. He believed this could be accomplished by suggesting to the media that, among other 
things, they should subject plaintiff's allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. For example, he noted 


in the statement that plaintiff's allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they 


are “obvious lies” and therefore should not be “publicised as news.” Jd. § 11. 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page15 of 77 


23. Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be “a shot across the 
bow” of the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations 
without conducting any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly noted 
that plaintiff's allegations were “defamatory.” In this sense, the statement was intended as a 
cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the 
seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false 
allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. Jd. § 17. 

24. Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow’s emails prefaced the statement with 
the following language: “Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms Maxwell” 
(emphasis supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-time-only, comprehensive 
response—quoted in full—to plaintiff’s December 30, 2014, allegations that would give the 
media Ms. Maxwell’s response. Jd. § 19. The purpose of the prefatory statement was to inform 
the media-recipients of this intent. Jd. 

25. Plaintiff’s activities to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. 
Plaintiff has engaged in numerous activities to bring attention to herself, to the prosecution and 
punishment of wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest of bringing light 
to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. 

26. Plaintiff created an organization, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida corporation, 
directly related to her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse. Doc.1 §] 24-25. 

27. The “goal” of Victims Refuse Silence “was, and continues to be, to help survivors 
surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse.” 
Id. § 25. Toward this end, plaintiff has “dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex 


trafficking.” Jd. 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page16 of 77 


28. Plaintiff repeatedly has sought out media organizations to discuss her alleged 
experience as a victim of sexual abuse. See This Motion at §§ 51-54. 

29. As discussed above, on December 30, 2014, plaintiff publicly filed an “entirely 
unnecessary” joinder motion laden with what Judge Marra described as “unnecessary,” “lurid 


details”? 


about being “sexually abused” as a “minor victim[]” by wealthy and famous men and 
being “trafficked” all around the world as a “sex slave.” EXHIBIT D, at | n.1, 3-6. 
30. The plaintiff's alleged purpose in filing the joinder motion was to “vindicate” her 


rights under the CVRA, expose the government’s “secretly negotiated” “non-prosecution 
agreement” with Epstein, “shed tremendous public light” on Epstein and “other powerful 
individuals” that would undermine the agreement, and support the CVRA plaintiffs’ request for 
documents that would show how Epstein “used his powerful political and social connections to 
secure a favorable plea deal” and the government’s “motive” to aid Epstein and his “co- 
conspirators.” See EXHIBIT D, at 1, 6-7, 10 (emphasis supplied). 

31. Plaintiff has written the manuscript of a book she has been trying to publish detailing 
her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse and of sex trafficking in Epstein’s alleged “sex 
scheme.” EXHIBIT KK. 


32. Republication alleged by plaintiff. Plaintiff® was required by Interrogatory No. 6 to 


identify any false statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell that were “‘published globally, including

within the Southern District of New York,”” as plaintiff alleged in Paragraph 9 of Count I of her 
complaint. In response, plaintiff identified the January 2015 statement and nine instances in 
which various news media published portions of the January 2015 statement in news articles or 
broadcast stories. EXHIBIT H, at 7-8; EXHIBIT I, at 4. 

33. Innone of the nine instances was there any publication of the entire January 2015 
statement. See EXHIBIT H, at 7-8; EXHIBIT I, at 4. 

34. Ms. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or authority over any media 
organization, including the media identified in plaintiff's response to Interrogatory No. 6, in 
connection with the media’s publication of portions of the January 2015 statement. EXHIBIT J 
4 24; EXHIBIT K §§ 2-3.. 

35. Plaintiff’s defamation action against Ms. Maxwell. Eight years after Epstein’s 
guilty plea, plaintiff brought this action, repeating many of the allegations she made in her 
CVRA joinder motion. See Doc.1 § 9. 

36. The complaint alleged that the January 2015 statement “contained the following 
deliberate falsehoods”: 

(a) That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” 

(b) That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.” 

(c) That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.” 
Doc.1 § 30 (boldface and underscoring omitted). 

SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD 
“[C]ourts should not be reluctant to grant summary judgment in appropriate cases. ‘One 

of the principal purposes of the summary judgment rule is to isolate and dispose of factually 
insupportable claims,’ thereby permitting courts to avoid ‘protracted, expensive and harassing 


trials.” Don King Prods., Inc. v. Douglas, 742 F. Supp. 778, 780 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (quoting 
10 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page18 of 77 


Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986), and Meiri v. Dacon, 759 F.2d 989, 998 
(2d Cir. 1985)). Where summary judgment is sought under Article I, Section 8, of the New York 
Constitution, the New York Court of Appeals has declared, “we reaffirm our regard for the 
particular value of summary judgment, where appropriate, in libel cases,” Jmmuno AG y. Moor- 
Jankowski, 567 N.E.2d 1270, 1282 (N.Y. 1991), particularly when as here a defendant is 
challenging a defamation claim under the “independent State law approach” articulated in 
Immuno AG that might make summary disposition more likely than under a federal approach, see 
id. 

Summary judgment is appropriate where “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact 
and... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The 
relevant inquiry on application for summary judgment is “whether the evidence presents a 
sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one 
party must prevail as a matter of law.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 
(1986). 

“(T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat 
an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be 
no genuine issue of material fact.” Id. at 247-48. The substantive law determines what facts are 
material. /d. at 248. “Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the 
governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are 
irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.” /d. A dispute about a material fact is “genuine” if 
the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Jd. 

In the face of a properly supported summary judgment motion, the plaintiff may not “rest 


on [the] allegations” in her complaint. Jd. at 249. The trial court’s function is to determine 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page19 of 77 


whether there is a genuine issue for trial, and “there is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient 
evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.” Jd. 

“(T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment . . . against 
a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential 
to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. 
v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). In such a situation, “there can be ‘no genuine issue as to 
any material fact,’ since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the 
nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is 
‘entitled to a judgment as a matter of law’ because the nonmoving party has failed to make a 
sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with respect to which she has the burden 
of proof.” Jd. at 323; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 advisory committee’s notes (2010 amendments) 
(restoration of “shall grant summary judgment” was intended to “express the direction to grant 
summary judgment, and “avoids the unintended consequences of any other word”). 

ARGUMENT 


I. Ms. Maxwell is not liable for republications of her January 2015 statement that she 
did not authorize or request and by entities she did not control. 


A. Summary judgment is warranted to the extent plaintiff seeks to impose liability 
on any media’s republication of all or a portion of the January 2015 statement. 


Messrs. Barden and Gow, acting on behalf of Ms. Maxwell, caused the January 2015 
statement to be transmitted—published—to various individuals employed by media 
organizations. The question presented in this Argument I is whether Ms. Maxwell is liable for 
any republication of all or a portion of the January 2015 statement by the media. Under New 
York law, the answer is no. 

Liability for a republication “must be based on real authority to influence the final 
product.” Davis v. Costa-Gavras, 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1096 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (emphasis supplied).

Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page20 of 77 


“[W here a defendant ‘had no actual part in composing or publishing,’ he cannot be held liable 
‘without disregarding the settled rule of law that no man is bound for the tortious act of another 
over whom he has not a master’s power of control.” /d. (quoting Folwell v. Miller, 145 F. 495, 
497 (2d Cir. 1906)); see Geraci v. Probst, 938 N.E.2d 917, 921 (N.Y. 2010) (holding that 
defendant was not liable for republication, in part because “there is no indication that Probst had 
any control over whether or not Newsday published the article”). “Conclusive evidence of lack 
of actual authority [is] sufficiently dispositive that the [trial court] ‘ha[s] no option but to dismiss 
the case... .’” Jd. (quoting Rinaldi v. Viking Penguin, Inc., 420 N.E.2d 377, 382 (N.Y. 1981)). 

As the New York Court of Appeals held in Geraci: 

It is too well settled to be now questioned that one who . . . prints and publishes a 

libel[] is not responsible for its voluntary and unjustifiable repetition, without his 

authority or request, by others over whom he has no control and who thereby 

make themselves liable to the person injured, and that such repetition cannot be 


considered in law a necessary, natural and probable consequence of the original 
slander or libel. 


938 N.E.2d at 921 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The rationale behind this rule is that 
“each person who repeats the defamatory statement is responsible for the resulting damages.” Id. 
(internal quotations omitted). 

With the goal of garnering maximum publicity and defaming Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Giuffre 
filed an “entirely unnecessary” joinder motion with “lurid details” about sexual acts for the 
purpose of attracting the attention of the public, which was “‘curious, titillated or intrigued’”* 
about alleged sexual acts and relationships among the rich and famous. In defense of 


Ms. Maxwell’s reputation, Messrs. Barden and Gow responded with the January 2015 statement.

Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page21 of 77 


The email transmitting the statement explained it was “a quotable statement on behalf of 

Ms Maxwell” and “[n]Jo further communication will be provided by her on this matter.” 
EXHIBIT F (emphasis supplied). The media representatives were notified that if they intended to 
use the statement, it was to be quoted in its entirety. See This Motion § 24, at 8. Ms. Maxwell 
and Messrs. Barden and Gow had no ability to control whether or how the media-recipients 
would use the statement, and they made no effort to control whether or how they would use the 
statement. EXHIBIT K §§ 2-3; EXHIBIT J § 24. 

Ms. Maxwell is not responsible for any republication of the January 2015 statement, 
whether it was republished in whole or in part,’ since she had no authority or control over any 
media that published any portion of it. In the words of this Court, she had no “real authority to 
influence the final product,” Davis, 580 F. Supp. at 1096. 

The media’s selective, partial republication of the statement is more problematic yet. An 


original publisher of a statement cannot be charged with a republisher’s “editing and excerpting 
of her statement.” Rand v. New York Times Co., 430 N.Y.S.2d 271, 275 (App. Div. 1980). The 
rule applies with even greater force where as here a defamation claim is grounded on the 
expression of opinion: An individual “cannot be liable for the republication of a derogatory but 
constitutionally protected opinion when the foundation upon which that opinion is based is 
omitted. The defamatory remark should be ‘read against the background of its issuance.’” Jd. 


(quoting Mencher v. Chesley, 75 N.E.2d 257, 259 (N.Y. 1947), and citing James v. Gannett Co., 


353 N.E.2d 834, 838 (N.Y. 1976)). 


°Plaintiff has not disclosed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) any republication of the 
entirety of the January 2015 statement. In response to our discovery requests requiring her to 
identify republications of all or a portion of the statement, plaintiff identified no republication of 
the entirety of the statement. 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page22 of 77 


The rationale for this rule is found in the New York Court of Appeals’ explanation of 
how an original publisher’s allegedly defamatory statement should be interpreted: 


The statement complained of will be read against the background of its issuance 
with respect to the circumstances of its publication. It is the duty of the court, in 
an action for libel, to understand the publication in the same manner that others 
would naturally do. The construction which it behooves a court of justice to put 
on a publication which is alleged to be libelous is to be derived as well from the 
expressions used as from the whole scope and apparent object of the writer. 


James, 353 N.E.2d at 838 (emphasis supplied; citations and internal quotations omitted). 

The January 2015 statement was intended to be read by the media-recipients in its 
entirety. One, it was intended to be a comprehensive, one-time-only response to all of plaintiff's 
lurid and false allegations of sexual and other misconduct by Ms. Maxwell. See EXHIBIT J § 13. 
Two, the statement was complex in that it could not be quoted partially and out of context and 
still convey the intended meaning. Among other things, the statement was intended to show why 
plaintiff could not be believed—why her allegations are “obvious lies”—by pointing out how her 
story changed each time she retold the story. As Mr. Barden explains: 


Selective and partial quotation and use of the statement would disserve my 
purposes. It was intended to address Plaintiff's behavior and allegations against 
Ms. Maxwell on a broad scale, that is to say, Plaintiff's history of making false 
allegations and innuendo to the media against Ms. Maxwell. This is why the 
statement references Plaintiff’s “original allegations” and points out that her story 
“changes” —i.e. is embellished—over time including the allegations “now” that 
Professor Dershowitz allegedly had sexual relations with her. This is why I 
distinguished in the statement between Plaintiff's “original” allegations and her 
“new,” joinder-motion allegations, which differed substantially from the original 
allegations. And this is why I wrote, “Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes 
with new salacious details about public figures and world leaders and now it is 
alleged by [Plaintiff] that Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual 
relations with her, which he denies.” (Emphasis supplied.) Having established the 
dramatic difference between Plaintiff's two sets of allegations, which suggested 
she was fabricating more and more-salacious allegations as she had more time to 
manufacture them, I added the third paragraph: “[Ms. Giuffre’s] claims are 
obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as they are 
defamatory.” (Emphasis supplied.) I believed then, and believe now, that it was 
and remains a fair inference and conclusion that her claims were and are “obvious 


15 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page23 of 77 


lies.” As noted, her claims not to have slept with Prince Andrew and to have slept 
with Prince Andrew are a classic example of an obvious lie. One or other account 
is on the face of it a lie. 


EXHIBIT J ¥ 20. That Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell was expressing his opinion—in the 
form of a legal argument—as a lawyer would be lost if words and phrases are extracted from and 
used outside the context of the January 2015 statement. Yet, this is precisely what the media did 
in their articles on the statement and what plaintiff did in her complaint (see Doc.1 § 30). 
Finally, the statement was intended to be a “shot across the bow” of the media-recipients so that 
they understood the seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of 
plaintiff's obviously false allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. See id. 

4 17. Selectively excerpting from the statement would seriously undermine this purpose by 
changing the force of the message to the media-recipients. 

Under these circumstances, selective, partial and out-of-context republication of 

Mr. Barden’s deliberate and carefully crafted message to the media-representatives, as a matter 
of law, cannot result in defamation liability for Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, the Court should 
enter partial summary judgment. 

B. Because plaintiff is a limited public figure, imposing liability upon Ms. Maxwell 
for republication of the January 2015 statement would violate the First 
Amendment. 

As this Court recognized in Davis, New York Times y. Sullivan'® and its progeny 

“preclude states from imposing liability without fault in actions for defamation, especially by 
public figures.” 580 F. Supp. at 1097 (citing, inter alia, Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 


323 (1974)). This principle precludes the imposition of liability for republication of an allegedly 


10376 U.S. 254 (1964). 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page24 of 77 


defamatory statement on a party who had no “actual . . . responsibility for the decision to 
republish” the statement. Jd. 

A public figure includes a person who “voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a 
particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.” 
Gertz, 418 U.S. at 351; see, e.g., James, 353 N.E.2d at 839 (public figure includes those who 
have “thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence 
the resolution of the issues involved”). The evidence that plaintiff is a public figure is 
overwhelming, particularly in connection with the subject matters and issues addressed by and 
underlying the January 2015 statement. See This Motion §§ 51-54. 

In the case at bar, Ms. Maxwell and her agents had no responsibility for any media 
organization’s decision to republish the January 2015 statement, and they did not participate in 
any such decision. See EXHIBITS J § 24 & K 4 2-3. Liability for republication by media 
organizations of the January 2015 statement therefore is precluded under the First Amendment. 


C. Plaintiff should be barred from introducing into evidence any republication of 
an excerpt from the January 2015 statement. 


In Geraci, the plaintiff suggested in a letter to the Long Island fire district where 
defendant was a commissioner that defendant had engaged in self-dealing in the district’s 
purchase of fire trucks. At trial the plaintiff sought to introduce into evidence portions of a 
Newsday article that republished parts of the defendant’s letter. Defense counsel objected, 
arguing it was inflammatory and prejudicial. Plaintiff's counsel later argued the article “was not 
being offered as a republication, but on the issue of damages to show how far the allegations had 
circulated.” 938 N.E.2d at 920. Additionally, plaintiffs counsel argued that the defendant 
“should have reasonably anticipated” that his letter to the fire district “would be newsworthy.” 


Id. The trial court admitted the article, and the Appellate Division affirmed. 


17 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page25 of 77 


The New York Court of Appeals reversed. The risk of admitting such evidence, the court 
held, is the jury may “charge against defendant a separate, distinct libel (not pleaded in [the] 
complaint) by someone else, contrary to the rule that [t]he original publisher of a libel is not 
responsible for its subsequent publication by others.” Geraci, 938 N.E.2d at 921. Accordingly, 
the court held, “‘[A]bsent a showing that [defendant] approved or participated in some other 
manner in the activities of the third-party republisher{,]’ there is no basis for allowing the jury to 
consider the article containing the republished statement as a measure of plaintiff's damages 
attributable to defendants.” /d. (emphasis supplied; quoting Karaduman v. Newsday, Inc., 416 
N.E.2d 557, 560 (1980)). 

Neither Ms. Maxwell nor her agents approved or participated in any activity of any media 
organization in its decision to publish or not to publish any part of the January 2015 statement. 
EXHIBIT J § 2; K 4 2-3.. Accordingly, “there is no basis for allowing the jury to consider [any] 
article containing the republished statement as a measure of plaintiff's damages attributable to 
[Ms. Maxwell],” id. Plaintiff should be barred from introducing any evidence of any 
republication of the January 2015 statement by any non-party. See, e.g., Soley v. Wasserman, No. 
8 CIV. 9262 KMW FM, 2013 WL 3185555, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 21, 2013) (precluding plaintiff 
from adducing evidence intended to establish claim on which court had entered partial summary 
judgment). 

Il. Summary judgment is warranted under the New York Constitution. 

A. The January 2015 statement constitutes nonactionable opinion. 

““Whether particular words are defamatory presents a legal question to be resolved by 
the court in the first instance.’” Germain v. M & T Bank Corp., 111 F. Supp. 3d 506, 534 


(S.D.N.Y. 2015) (brackets omitted; quoting Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enters. Inc., 209 F.3d 163, 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page26 of 77 


177 (2d Cir. 2000)); accord, e.g., Aronson v. Wiersma, 483 N.E.2d 1138, 1139 (N.Y. 1985). New 
York defamation law applies. Doc.37 at 6 n.2. 

“Tt is a settled rule that expressions of an opinion false or not, libelous or not, are 
constitutionally protected and may not be the subject of private damage actions.” Steinhilber v. 
Alphonse, 501 N.E.2d 550, 550 (N.Y. 1986) (internal quotations omitted). Whether a challenged 
statement is fact or opinion is a question of law to be decided by the Court. Enigma Software 
Grp. USA, LLC y. Bleeping Computer LLC, No. 16 CIV. 57 (PAE), 2016 WL 3773394, at *11 
(S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2016); accord, e.g., Steinhilber, 501 N.E.2d at 553. 

In Immuno AG y. Moor-Jankowski,'' the New York Court of Appeals declared that the 
New York Constitution provides greater protection to opinion than the First Amendment of the 
United States Constitution. The court recognized that in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 
U.S. 1 (1990), the United States Supreme Court reversed a state court decision dismissing a 
complaint on the ground that the allegedly defamatory statement was nonactionable opinion. The 
Supreme Court held there is no “wholesale defamation exemption” protecting opinion. The First 
Amendment analysis under Milkovich, the New York court observed, was one-dimensional: the 
trial court should look first to the allegedly defamatory statement’s specific words as commonly 
understood and then determine whether the statements were “verifiable”; if the statements were 
verifiable, then they were actionable statements of fact. See Immuno AG, 567 N.E.2d at 1274-75. 
The Supreme Court’s holding made it clear that it would not consider as part of the First 
Amendment analysis “the full context of the article in which the challenged statements appear, 


and the broader social context or setting surrounding the communication.” Jd. at 1274. 


"567 N.E.2d 1270 (N.Y. 1991). 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page27 of 77 


The Immuno AG Court of Appeals held that Article I, Section 8, of the New York 
Constitution required a multidimensional approach to the determination whether an allegedly 
defamatory statement constitutes constitutionally protected opinion. The court gave numerous 
reasons. New York’s “expansive” constitutional guarantee of speech was formulated and adopted 
before the application of the First Amendment to the states; “[i]t has long been our standard in 
defamation actions” to consider factors beyond whether facts are “verifiable”; and the court was 
concerned that if “‘type of speech’ is to be construed narrowly[,] . . . insufficient protection may 
be accorded to central values protected by the law of this State.” /d. at 1277-78. The Immuno AG 
court reaffirmed that where a defendant alleges that the subject statement is opinion, Steinhilber 
supplies the analytical framework. /d. at 1280. 

Steinhilber held that whether an allegedly defamatory statement is fact or nonactionable 
opinion should be decided based on four factors: (1) an assessment of whether the specific 
language in issue has a precise meaning which is readily understood or whether it is indefinite 
and ambiguous; (2) a determination of whether the statement is capable of being objectively 
characterized as true or false; (3) an examination of the full context of the communication in 
which the statement appears; and (4) a consideration of the broader social context or setting 
surrounding the communication including the existence of any applicable customs or 
conventions which might signal to readers or listeners that what is being read or heard is likely to 
be opinion, not fact. 501 N.E.2d at 554. 

Application of these factors to the January 2015 statement compels the conclusion that 
the allegedly defamatory words, phrases and clauses are nonactionable opinion. 


Whether the specific language in issue has a precise meaning which is readily 


understood or whether it is indefinite and ambiguous. The three sentences plaintiff alleges are 


20 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page28 of 77 


defamatory are indefinite and ambiguous. The first says plaintiffs “allegations” against 

Ms. Maxwell are “untrue.” But plaintiff has made many dozens of allegations against 

Ms. Maxwell, and some are provably false. See This Motion, at {J 37-50. The statement does not 
specify which of the allegations are untrue. The second statement is that the “original 
allegations” have been “shown to be untrue.” The “original allegations” were first revealed in the 
2011 Churcher articles. Plaintiff made many dozens of allegations “originally.” The statement 
does not specify which of the “original” allegations were shown to be untrue. Some have been 
shown to be untrue. See This Motion, at 53-65. The third statement is that plaintiff's “claims” are 
“obvious lies.” This too is indefinite and ambiguous. Plaintiff has made many dozens of claims. 
The statement does not specify which ones are being referenced. More importantly, it does not 
say how or why some of the claims are “obvious” lies. Regardless, some of plaintiff's claims are 
“obvious lies.” See This Motion, at 53-65. 

Whether the three sentences in the January 2015 statement are capable of being 
objectively characterized as true or false. Can the three sentences be characterized as true or 
false? They cannot, because the statement does not specify which of the many dozens of 
allegations plaintiff has made are “untrue” and “shown to be untrue,” and which of plaintiff's 
many dozens of “claims” are “obvious lies.” 

It is axiomatic that the plural form of a word, e.g., “allegations” and “claims,” universally 
denotes—only—‘‘more than one,” People v. Kocsis, 28 N.Y.S.3d 466, 471 (App. Div. 2016) 
(emphasis supplied). See, e.g., Lehman Bros. Commercial Corp. v. Minmetals Int’l Non-Ferrous 
Metals Trading Co., No. 94 CIV. 8301(JFK), 1995 WL 380119, at *6 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 


1995). So for Steinhilber purposes it is dispositive of the fact versus opinion question if we can 


21 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page29 of 77 


identify wo instances in which plaintiff's allegations or claims! are incapable of being proved 
true or false. Such examples abound. It cannot be proven true or false whether Ms. Maxwell 
“appreciated the immunity granted”! under the Epstein plea agreement or whether she “act[ed] 
as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.”'* That is because these are plaintiffs counsel’s arguments or 
opinions. The January 2015 statement asserts that these allegations/claims are “false” or 
“obvious lies.” That assertion cannot be proven true or false under Steinhilber. 

The full context of the communication in which the statement appears. This factor “is 
often the key consideration in categorizing a statement as fact or opinion.” Davis v. Boeheim, 22 
N.E.3d 999, 1006 (N.Y. 2014) (internal quotations omitted). 

In deciding whether a statement is defamatory, “[t]he words must be construed in the 
context of the entire statement or publication as a whole, tested against the understanding of the 
average reader.” Aronson v. Wiersma, 483 N.E.2d 1138, 1139 (1985); accord Elias v. Rolling 
Stone LLC, No. 15-CV-5953 (PKC), 2016 WL 3583080, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2016). “It is 
the duty of the court, in an action for libel, to understand the publication in the same manner that 
others would naturally do. The construction which it behooves a court of justice to put on a 


publication which is alleged to be libelous is to be derived as well from the expressions used as 


"In the context of the January 2015 statement, an “allegation” is synonymous with a 
“claim.” See, e.g., Maule v. Philadelphia Media Holdings, LLC, No. CIV.A. 08-3357, 2010 WL 
914926, at *10 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 15, 2010); see generally Black’s Law Dictionary 68 (5" ed. 1979) 
(defining “allegation” as “[t]he assertion, claim, declaration, or statement of a party to an action, 
made in a pleading, setting out what he expects to prove”), quoted with approval in Martin v. 
City of Oceanside, 205 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1147 (S.D. Cal. 2002), aff’d, 360 F.3d 1078 (om Cir.

from the whole scope and apparent object of the writer.” James v. Gannett Co., 353 N.E.2d 834, 
838 (N.Y. 1976); accord, e.g., Chau v. Lewis, 935 F. Supp. 2d 644, 665 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). 

In general the trial court should view allegedly defamatory statements from the 
perspective of the average member of the public. Statements directed to a specific audience, 
however, are considered from the viewpoint of that audience. Instructive is this Court’s analysis 
of the perspective from which it should assess an allegedly defamatory article on boxing 
published to sports readers: 


The issue of how the “average reader” would construe the statements is 
certainly a fair one, for the question of whether statements are defamatory turns 
on how the audience to whom the statements are addressed would interpret 
them. .. . As the New York State Court of Appeals has explained in [a] boxing- 
defamation case[]: . . . . “The words are to be construed not with the close 
precision expected from lawyers and judges but as they would be read and 
understood by the public to which they are addressed... .” 


Here, the statements in question were addressed to readers of an Internet 
boxing website and the sports pages of daily newspapers. The statements must be 
considered from their viewpoint. As Judge Martin . . . held [in Horne v. Matthews, 
No. 97 Civ. 3605(JSM), 1997 WL 598452 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 1997)]: “An article 
on the sports page of a newspaper should be viewed from the perspective of the 
audience to whom it is addressed, i.e., the understanding of “a sophisticated and 
sports-conscious reader.”

The entirety of the email containing the January 2015 statement from Mr. Gow sent to

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts—so not a new individual. The allegations made by 
Victoria Roberts [sic] against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original 
allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 


Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about 
public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that 
Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he 
denies. 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not 
publicised as news, as they are defamatory. 


Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains 

the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which 

have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek 

redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims. 

EXHIBIT F (italics and underscoring supplied). 

Plaintiff listed the underscored clauses/phrases in the Complaint as the “deliberate 
falsehoods,” Doc.1 4] 30, and “false and defamatory statements,” id. 32, plaintiff is suing on.'* 
As discussed above, it is improper to remove from their context and isolate allegedly defamatory 
words, phrases and clauses of sentences from an allegedly defamatory publication. Instead, the 
allegedly defamatory words, phrases and clauses must be (a) “construed in the context of the 
entire statement or publication as a whole”;'® (b) considered “from the whole scope and apparent 
object of the writer”;!’ and (c) “viewed from the perspective of the audience to whom it is 
addressed.”'® 


The statement was directed at a discrete number of —some 30—members of the media in 


reply to their request for a response from Ms. Maxwell to Ms. Giuffre’s CVRA joinder motion. 


'SPlaintiff also alleges that Ms. Maxwell slandered her on January 4, 2015, when 
responding to a question posed to her while she was on a Manhattan street. Doc.1 § 37. This 
allegedly defamatory statement is addressed in Argument IV, below.

Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend the January 2015 statement 
to be a traditional press release solely to disseminate information to the media. EXHIBIT K § 15. 
So he did not request that Mr. Gow or any other public relations specialist prepare the statement. 
Id. Instead, Mr. Gow served only as Mr. Barden’s conduit to the media representatives who had 
requested a response to the joinder motion allegations and who Mr. Barden believed might 
republish those allegations. Jd. 

Mr. Barden intended the statement to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation 
from the press’s republication of plaintiff's false allegations. Jd. § 16. He believed this could be 
accomplished by suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject plaintiff's 
allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. /d. For example, he noted that plaintiff's allegations changed 
dramatically over time, suggesting that they are “obvious lies” and therefore should not be 
“publicised as news.” Jd. 

Mr. Barden also intended the January 2015 statement to be “‘a shot across the bow” of the 
media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations without 
conducting any inquiry of their own. /d. § 17. So Mr. Barden stated repeatedly that plaintiff's 
allegations were “defamatory.” Jd. In this sense, the statement was very much intended as a cease 
and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the seriousness 
with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiffs obviously false allegations and 
the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. Id. 

Consistent with Mr. Barden’s purposes for the statement, Mr. Gow’s emails prefaced 
the statement with the following language: “Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf 
of Ms Maxwell” (emphasis supplied). /d. §j 19. The statement was intended to be a single, one- 


time-only, comprehensive response—quoted in full—to plaintiff's December 30, 2014, 


25 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page33 of 77 


allegations that would give the media Ms. Maxwell’s response. Jd. The purpose of the prefatory 
statement was to inform the media-recipients of this intent. Jd. 

We note that plaintiff in her Complaint makes the same mistake as the Steinhilber 
plaintiff—extracting words and phrases from their opinion context so that she can claim the 
assertion of a “defamatory” fact. See Doc.1 § 30. That is not permissible. See Steinhilber, 501 
N.E.2d at 555 (“The sentence which plaintiff selects from the message and claims is “factually 
laden”—impugning her as lacking in “talent, ambition, and initiative’*—is preceded and 
followed by statements which are clearly part of the attempt at humor prevailing 
throughout... .”). 

The broader social context or setting surrounding the communication, including the 
existence of any applicable customs or conventions which might signal to readers that what 
is being read is likely to be opinion, not fact. This factor is concerned with “the factual 
background” leading up to the preparation of the statement. It is a critical factor here. In 
December 2014, plaintiff and her lawyers had timed for maximum effect—during the slow news 
cycle between Christmas and New Year’s Day—the public filing of a superfluous motion filled 
with salacious and provocative allegations of “sexual abuse” and “sexual trafficking” involving 
wealthy and prominent Americans. Plaintiff deliberately placed Ms. Maxwell in the middle of 
the abuse and trafficking, alleging that she recruited plaintiff into the sexual abuse/trafficking 
scheme and engaged in numerous criminal acts. 

Importantly, three years earlier when plaintiff was interviewed extensively by Churcher 
for two lengthy articles published in March 2011, plaintiff's allegations concerning Ms. Maxwell 


were very much different. In the articles discussing plaintiff's “shocking account”'’ of being 


‘EXHIBIT A, at 2.

Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page34 of 77

sexually exploited by Epstein, Prince Andrew and Epstein’s “male peers,” plaintiff made 


virtually none of what Judge Marra found were “unnecessary”! and “lurid details””? about how 
Ms. Maxwell allegedly had subjected her to sexual abuse and trafficking. 

After plaintiff filed the CVRA motion, some thirty reporters contacted Ms. Maxwell’s 
press representative, Mr. Gow, for Ms. Maxwell’s response. As Ms. Maxwell’s lawyer, Mr. 
Barden undertook that task. Relying on his knowledge of the 2011 articles publishing plaintiff's 
allegations and drawing on his experience and training as a lawyer, Mr. Barden crafted a 
response with the goal of discrediting plaintiff and what the statement called plaintiff's “new” 
allegations. To that end Mr. Barden contrasted plaintiff's “old” allegations from 2011 with the 
“new” 2014 allegations. The second paragraph of the statement is indicative of this strategy: 
“Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about public figures 
and world leaders and now it is alleged by [Ms. Giuffre] that Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved 
in having sexual relations with her, which he denies.” EXHIBIT F (emphasis supplied). Having 
established the dramatic difference between these sets of allegations suggesting plaintiff was 
fabricating more and more-salacious allegations as she had more time to manufacture them, 

Mr. Barden added the third paragraph: “[Ms. Giuffre’s] claims are obvious lies and should be 
treated as such and not publicised as news, as they are defamatory.” /d. (emphasis supplied). 

Mr. Barden’s arguments constitute “pure opinion,” Steinhilber, 501 N.E.2d at 552. They 
take established and revealed facts—plaintiff’s modest 2011 allegations to a newspaper reporter 


and plaintiff's expansive, unnecessary and lurid 2014 allegations in a motion to open the door to

criminal prosecutions of (and civil lawsuits against) wealthy and prominent men around the 
world—to draw an obvious inference that plaintiff was (more) truthful in the 2011 articles and 
engaged in massive manufacturing of fiction in the 2014 joinder motion. There is no limit to the 
subject matters on which pure opinions may be expressed with constitutional immunity, 
including whether a person believes another is “lying” or is a “liar.” See, e.g., Indep. Living Aids, 
Inc. v. Maxi-Aids, Inc., 981 F. Supp. 124, 128 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (granting summary judgment: 
“Read in the context of the entire article, Zaretsky’s remarks, calling Sandler and others ‘liars,’ 
can only be understood as a denial of their accusations. . .. Even the most careless reader must 
have perceived that the words were no more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet used by 
Zaretsky who considered himself unfairly treated and sought to bring what he alleged were the 
true facts to the readers. The epithet ‘liar’ in this context, standing by itself, merely expressed the 
opinion that anyone who persisted in accusing Zaretsky of improper business practices could not 
be telling the truth. Since the basis for this opinion was fully set forth, the communication of 
Zaretsky’s views cannot be libelous.”’) (citations, ellipsis, brackets and internal quotations 
omitted); see Gross v. New York Times, 623 N.E.2d 1163, 1169 (N.Y. 1993) (“[E]ven when 
uttered or published in a. . . serious tone, accusations of criminality could be regarded as mere 
hypothesis and therefore not actionable if the facts on which they are based are fully and 
accurately set forth and it is clear to the reasonable reader . . . that the accusation is merely a 
personal surmise built upon those facts. In all cases, whether the challenged remark concerns 
criminality or some other defamatory category, the courts are obliged to consider the 
communication as a whole, as well as its immediate and broader social contexts, to determine 
whether the reasonable listener . . . is likely to understand the remark as an assertion of provable 


fact.”). 


28 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page36 of 77 


Mr. Barden’s inference from disclosed facts qualifies as “pure opinion,” Steinhilber, 501 
N.E.2d at 552. Accordingly, that Mr. Barden characterized plaintiff's 2014 allegations harshly as 
“obvious lies” as opposed to “untruths” or some softer term is of no moment. “[U]nder New 
York law, pure opinion . . . is not actionable because expressions of opinion, as opposed to 
assertions of fact, are deemed privileged and, no matter how offensive, cannot be the subject of 
an action for defamation.” Ratajack v. Brewster Fire Dep't, Inc. of the Brewster-SE Joint Fire 
Dist., 178 F. Supp. 3d 118, 158 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (internal quotations and ellipsis omitted; 
brackets altered); accord, e.g., Mann v. Abel, 885 N.E.2d 884, 885-86 (N.Y. 2008). 

The drawing of such inferences would be constitutionally protected even under the 
standards of the First Amendment that are less protective of opinion than is Article I, Section 8, 
of the New York Constitution. See Adelson v. Harris, 973 F. Supp. 2d 467, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) 
(“In determining whether a statement constitutes constitutionally protected opinion, courts also 
look to the specific context of the statement. When looking at a statement’s specific context, of 
particular importance is the principle that when an author outlines the facts available to him, thus 
making it clear that the challenged statements represent his own interpretation of those facts and 
leaving the reader free to draw his own conclusions, those statements are generally protected by 
the First Amendment.”) (internal quotations and brackets omitted). 

The application of the four Steinhilber factors confirms that the three phrases and/or 
clauses plaintiff alleges are defamatory are in fact part of a statement that taken as a whole 
constitutes nonactionable opinion. The premise of plaintiff's Complaint is that once she is able to 
identify references in the January 2015 statement to any assertion of fact that potentially is 
subject to proof, e.g., the truth or falsity of her many dozens of allegations old and new, then she 


has a viable defamation claim. That ignores the teaching of Steinhilber and Immuno AG. As the 


29 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page37 of 77 


Steinhilber court held, “even apparent statements of fact may assume the character of statements 
of opinion, and thus be privileged, when made in public debate, heated labor dispute, or other 
circumstances in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or 
hyperbole.” /d. (internal quotations and brackets omitted); see Gross, 623 N.E.2d at 1169 (“we 
stress once again our commitment to avoiding the ‘hypertechnical parsing’ of written and spoken 
words for the purpose of identifying ‘possible “fact[s]’” that might form the basis of sustainable 
libel action’’) (quoting Immuno AG, 567 N.E.2d at 1282). 

To the same effect is this Court’s citation to a Louisiana Supreme Court decision for the 
proposition that “‘[w]ords which, taken by themselves, would appear to be a positive allegation 
of fact, may be shown by the context to be a mere expression of opinion or argumentative 
influence.’” Adelson, 973 F. Supp. 2d at 488 (emphasis supplied; quoting Mashburn v. Collin, 
355 So. 2d 879, 885 (La. 1977)). 

It also is important to take into account, as Steinhilber requires, that Mr. Barden was 
directing the January 2015 statement to a discrete number of media representatives who were 
aware of plaintiff’s “original” and “new,” joinder-motion allegations and who were requesting a 
response from Ms. Maxwell to the “new” allegations. These newspaper reporters and other 
media representatives would have the point Mr. Barden was making—the opinion he was 
expressing—namely, that there was good reason to believe plaintiff was fabricating allegations 
for her purposes. In the context of the media circus that ensued the public filing of the joinder 
motion and the media’s repeated and insistent requests for an immediate response from 
Ms. Maxwell, it is highly unlikely any media-recipients of the January 2015 statement expected 
anything other than a statement equivalent to the March 2011 statement condemning the 


allegations; and it is highly likely all the media-recipients understood the statement to be a 


30 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page38 of 77 


forceful argument that plaintiffs shifting and inconsistent stories about what allegedly happened 
rendered her inherently unbelievable and proved her increasingly provocative and lurid 
allegations were “obvious lies.” These are precisely the messages Mr. Barden sent to them. 


The general nature of Mr. Barden’s assertions (“allegations,” “original allegations,” 
“claims”), the distinction between plaintiff's “original” and “new” allegations, and the inferences 
he drew from comparing the “original” and “new” allegations—together—powerfully 
demonstrate that the January 2015 statement was nothing more than opinion. 

B. In this Rule 56 proceeding, this Court’s Rule 12(b)(6) opinion does not control 


the question of law whether the January 2015 statement constitutes 
nonactionable opinion. 


In its Rule 12(b)(6) opinion the Court, relying on Davis v. Boeheim, 22 N.E.3d 999 
(2014), ruled that the three allegedly defamatory statements in the January 2015 statement (see 
Doc.1 § 30(a)-(c)) have a specific and readily understood factual meaning, are capable of being 
proven true or false, and “clearly constitute fact to the reader.” Doc.37 at 9. We respectfully 
suggest the Court’s Rule 12(b)(6) decision does not control in this Rule 56 proceeding. 

To begin with, the standards for deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion are substantially 
different from the standards for deciding a Rule 56 motion. As the Court noted, in deciding a 
12(b)(6) motion the court must accept as true the factual allegations and draw all inferences in 
the plaintiff's favor; a plaintiff need only state a claim that is “plausible on its face.” Jd. at 3 
(internal quotations omitted). In contrast, in deciding a Rule 56 motion the plaintiff defending the 
motion may not “rest on [the] allegations” in her complaint. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. The 
difference in the standards is crucial here. 

As this Court recognized, “‘[t]he dispositive inquiry’” for purposes of deciding whether 
an allegedly defamatory statement is fact or nonactionable opinion is whether “‘a reasonable 


reader could have concluded that the statements were conveying facts about the plaintiff.” 


31 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page39 of 77 


Doc.37 at 7 (quoting Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1005). To answer that inquiry, the Court applied the 
three factors enumerated in Davis. See id. These three factors are the same as the four factors in 
Immuno AG; the difference is that the Davis court collapsed the Immuno AG’s third and fourth 
factors into one. See Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1005. 

As framed by the Davis court, the third factor is “whether either the fill context of the 
communication in which the statement appears or the broader social context and surrounding 
circumstances are such as to signal . . . readers or listeners that what is being read or heard is 
likely to be opinion, not fact.” /d. (internal quotations omitted; emphasis supplied), quoted in 
Doc.37 at 7. Although this Court did not note this in its opinion, this third factor “is often the key 
consideration in categorizing a statement as fact or opinion.” /d. at 1006 (emphasis supplied). 

As in Davis, which also was decided on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,” this Court when 
considering the third factor did not have the benefit of any of the evidence presented in this 
motion. That is to say, the Court did not have the “full context of the” July 2015 statement or the 
“broader social context and surrounding circumstances” of the statement, since none of the 
evidence presented in this Motion was pleaded in the Complaint. 

Nor, in the context of the 12(b)(6) motion, did the Court consider that the relevant 
“readers” of the July 2015 statement were not the “average reader” in the general public, but a 
“cynical””’ and “sophisticated””° group of about 30 reporters and journalists who were 


knowledgeable about plaintiff's allegations of being the victim of sexual abuse and sexual

trafficking. Viewing the July 2015 statement from the perspective of these reporters and 
journalists—the only persons who received the July 2015 statement—presents a different 
landscape in the “fact versus opinion” analysis. 

Applying the third factor with the benefit of the Rule 56 records compels a conclusion 
different from the one this Court reached on the barren Rule 12(b)(6) record. For example, this 
Court did not consider that the media-recipients of the July 2015 statement would have 
understood the statement in precisely the way Mr. Barden intended: Based on a comparison of 
dramatic differences between her “original” and “new” allegations, Ms. Giuffre is a teller of 
falsehoods—is a liar—and cannot be trusted, and her new CVRA joint-motion allegations, which 
deviated so substantially from her originally allegations, are falsehoods—proven false by her 
increasingly provocative and lurid versions of her story of “victimhood.” See generally Exhibit J. 


Ill. The pre-litigation privilege bars this action. 


Statements pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation made by attorneys (or their 
agents under their direction’) before the commencement of litigation are privileged and “no 
cause of action for defamation can be based on those statements,” Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 28 
N.E.3d 15, 16 (N.Y. 2015). So long as there was “a good faith basis to anticipate litigation,” a 
statement concerning either “actual litigation or prelitigation matters” is subject to an “absolute 
privilege.” Flomenhaft v. Finkelstein, 8 N.Y.S.3d 161, 164 n.2 (App. Div. 2015) (emphasis 
supplied); accord Kirk v. Heppt, 532 F. Supp. 2d 586, 593 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). 

The privilege covers statements made in connection with “pending or “contemplated 
litigation.” Goldstein v. Cogswell, No. 85 CIV. 9256 (KMW), 1992 WL 131723, at *27 n.32 


(S.D.N.Y. June 1, 1992) It covers statements made outside court, including in written 


7See Chambers v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 2016 WL 3533998, at *8 (D.N.J. June 
28, 2016); see generally Hawkins v. Harris, 661 A.2d 284, 289-91 (N.J. 1995). 


33 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page41 of 77 


communications “between litigating parties or their attorneys.” Klein v. McGauley, 29. A.D.2d 
418, 420 (N.Y. App. Div. 1968), cited with approval in Petrus v. Smith, 91 A.D.2d 1190, 1191 
(N.Y. App. App. Div. 1983). It covers “cease and desist letters.” Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19. And it 
covers “all pertinent communications among the parties, counsel, witnesses and the court,” 
regardless “[w]hether a statement was made in or out of court, was on or off the record, or was 
made orally or in writing.” Frechtman v. Gutterrnan, 979 N.Y.S. 2d 58 (App. Div. 2014) 
(quoting Sexter v. Warmflash, P.C. v. Margrabe, 828 N.Y.S. 2d 315 (App. Div. 2007)). 

When the pre-litigation privilege is invoked in connection with an allegedly defamatory 
statement made during pending or contemplated litigation, “any doubts are to be resolved in 
favor of pertinence.” Flomenhaji, 8 N.Y.S.3d at 164. “[T]he test to determine whether a 


statement is pertinent to litigation is “extremely liberal,” such that the offending statement, to 
be actionable, must have been ‘outrageously out of context.” Id. at 164-65 (emphasis supplied; 
quoting Black v. Green Harbour Homeowners’ Ass'n, 798 N.Y.S.2d 753 (App. Div. 2005), and 
Martirano vy. Frost, 255 N.E.2d 693 (1969)); Kirk, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 593. 

In denying Ms. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the Complaint based on the pre-litigation 
privilege, this Court limited its analysis of the privilege to whether under the Rule 12(b)(6) 
standard plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded that the January 2 and 4 statements were made with 


actual malice. Doc.37 at 18-19. The Court’s Rule 12(b)(6) analysis does not bear on the question 


presented here, for two reasons. 


2: 


Under the “substantive law””* actual malice is not relevant to the pre-litigation defense. 
The New York Court of Appeals in Khalil held that to prevail on the pre-litigation privilege the 


defendant need only establish one element: the allegedly defamatory statement at issue was 


°8 Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. 


34 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page42 of 77 


“pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation.” 28 N.E.3d at 16. Upon establishing that element, 
summary judgment for the defendant is required. See id. Additionally, this is a summary 
judgment proceeding. Plaintiff cannot rely on the allegations of her Complaint. Evidence is 
required. 

The following evidence is not in dispute. By January 2015 Ms. Maxwell had retained 
British Solicitor Philip Barden to represent and advise her in connection with plaintiff's 
publication in the British press of salacious, defamatory allegations of criminal sexual abuse 
during the period 1999-2002. EXHIBIT K §f 8-10. Mr. Barden in turn engaged UK press agent 
Ross Gow. /d. § 9. Mr. Barden prepared the January 2015 statement and instructed Mr. Gow to 
transmit it via email to members of the UK media who had made inquiry about the allegations in 
the joinder motion. Jd. J 10. 

Mr. Barden did not intend the January 2015 statement as a traditional press release solely 
to disseminate information to the media. /d. J 15. This is why he intentionally did not request 
that Mr. Gow or any other public relations specialist prepare the statement. /d. Instead, Mr. Gow 
served as his conduit to the media representatives who had requested a response to the joinder 
motion allegations and who Mr. Barden believed might republish those allegations. Jd. 

Mr. Barden had two purposes in preparing and causing the statement to be disseminated 
to those media representatives. First, he wanted to mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation 
from the press’s republication of plaintiff's false allegations. Jd. § 16. He believed these ends 
could be accomplished by suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject 
plaintiff’s allegations to inquiry and scrutiny. /d. For example, he noted in the January 2015 
statement that plaintiff's allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they are 


“obvious lies” and therefore should not be “publicised as news.” Id. 


35 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page43 of 77 


Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be “a shot across the bow” of 
the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish plaintiff's allegations without 
conducting any inquiry of their own. /d. § 17. This was the purpose of repeatedly stating that 
plaintiff’s allegations were “defamatory.” Jd. The statement was intended as a cease and desist 
letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the seriousness with which 
Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false allegations and the legal 
indefensibility of their own conduct. Id. 

At the time Mr. Barden directed the issuance of the statement, he was contemplating 
litigation against the media-recipients as an additional means to mitigate and prevent harm to 
Ms. Maxwell. Jd. § 28. Toward this end, he prepared the statement so that it made clear 
Ms. Maxwell “strongly denie[d] the allegations of an unsavoury nature,” declared the 
republications of the allegations to be false, gave the press-recipients notice that the 
republications of the allegations “are defamatory,” and informed them that Ms. Maxwell was 
“reserv[ing] her right to seek redress.” Jd. § 30. In any such UK defamation, or other related, 
action Ms. Giuffre would be a defendant or a witness. Jd. § 29. 

The question presented is whether Mr. Barden’s statement, which he directed to be sent 
to various media representatives, is “pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation,” Khalil, 28 
N.E.3d at 16. 

The requirement of “good faith” anticipated litigation is intended to prevent attorneys (or 
their agents) from “bully[ing], harass[ing], or intimidat[ing] their client’s adversaries by 
threatening baseless litigation or by asserting unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact, 
in violation of counsel’s ethical obligations,” id. at 19. The statement Mr. Barden prepared and 


caused to be issued was not intended to bully, harass or intimidate the press-recipients, i.e., the 


36 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page44 of 77 


potential defendants in an action by Ms. Maxwell for defamation. See EXHIBIT K §§ 26-30. 
Nothing about the statement on its face suggested bullying, harassing or intimidating the press- 
recipients (or anyone else). At the time Mr. Barden directed the issuance of the statement, he had 
sufficient factual and legal grounds to pursue in good faith a defamation action against one or 
more of the press-recipients for republishing plaintiff's allegations. See generally id. §§ 8-30. 

That the statement was directed at the press-recipients—which had republished plaintiff's 
false allegations and was not directed at plaintiff—is irrelevant to the absolute privilege 
protecting pre-litigation communications. In /nternational Publishing Concepts, LLC v. 
Locatelli, \etters and emails detailing likely litigation and an intent to sue were extended the 
same pre-litigation privilege although sent to two non-parties who were only potentially affected 
by the litigation or witnesses to it. See also Kirk, 532 F. Supp. 2d at 593 (“The privilege is broad, 
and embraces anything that may possibly or plausibly be relevant to the litigation.”) (internal 
quotations omitted). 

The only issue remaining is whether the statement was pertinent to the contemplated 
litigation. Applying the “extremely liberal” test of pertinence, in which “any doubts are to be 
resolved in favor of pertinence,””’ the court must decide whether the allegedly defamatory 
statement is “outrageously out of context” in relation to the contemplated litigation. F/omenha/i, 
8 N.Y.S.3d at 164-65 (internal quotations omitted). Nothing in the statement is “outrageously out 
of context.” Every statement was directly related to the press-recipients’ republication of 
plaintiff's false allegations against Ms. Maxwell. 

The January 4 statement also is absolutely privileged. According to plaintiff, 


Ms. Maxwell told a reporter on that date when asked to comment on plaintiff's joinder-motion 


°Flomenhaft, 8 N.Y .S.3d at 164 (internal quotations omitted). 


37 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page45 of 77 


allegations: “I am referring to the statement that was made.” Doc.1 § 32. Assuming arguendo the 
statement is defamatory,” it is absolutely privileged since it simply refers to an absolutely 
privileged statement. See, e.g., Klein, 29 A.D.2d at 420 (privilege protects communications 
“between litigating parties”); Frechtman, 979 N.Y.S.2d at 63 (privilege protects communications 
“made in or out of court, ... on or off the record, ... orally or in writing”) (internal quotations 
omitted). 

Under these circumstances the pre-litigation privilege is absolute and “no cause of action 
for defamation can be based on those statements,” Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 16. The Court should 
enter summary judgment on plaintiff's defamation claim. 

IV. Ms. Maxwell’s January 4, 2015, statement is nonactionable. 

Plaintiff alleges that on January 4, 2015, a reporter approached Ms. Maxwell on a public 
street in Manhattan and “asked Maxwell about Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell.” Doc.1 
4/37. Plaintiff alleges that Ms. Maxwell responded with a single sentence: “‘I am referring to the 
statement that we made.”” /d. According to plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell’s statement was defamatory. 
See id. 4 37 & Count 14 5, at 8. Judgment should enter against plaintiff as to Ms. Maxwell’s 
statement. 

Adelson controls this portion of plaintiff's defamation claim. In Ade/son a non-profit 
organization during the 2012 presidential campaign published a statement on its website critical 
of Sheldon Adelson, a wealthy Republican donor. The statement alleged Adelson had donated 
“tainted” and “dirty” money to Governor Romney. Eight days later the organization withdrew 


the statement from its website. On the same day it issued a press release explaining that although 


5As discussed in Argument IV, the January 4 statement is nonactionable. 


38 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page46 of 77 


it took down the statement, “we stand by everything we said, which was sourced from current, 
credible news accounts.” 973 F. Supp. 2d at 474. 

Adelson sued. He alleged that the statement was defamatory and that the press release 
constituted a republication of the defamatory statement. This court held that the statement 
contained only constitutionally protected opinion and was nonactionable. The court then rejected 


the defamation claim based on republication: “‘[A] mere reference to another writing that 
contains defamatory matter does not constitute an actionable repetition or republication.” Jd. 
(quoting Goforth v. Avemco Life Ins. Co., 368 F.2d 25, 28 n.7 (4th Cir.1966)). This is the settled 
rule. See In re Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC, 690 F.3d 161, 175 (3d Cir. 2012), as corrected 
(Oct. 25, 2012) (“under traditional principles of republication, a mere reference to an article, 
regardless how favorable it is as long as it does not restate the defamatory material, does not 
republish the material”); Salyer v. S. Poverty Law Ctr., Inc., 701 F. Supp. 2d 912, 916 (W.D. Ky. 
2009) (“[T]he common thread of traditional republication is that it presents the material, in its 
entirety, before a new audience. A mere reference to a previously published article does not do 
that.”). 

Ms. Maxwell’s one-sentence response that merely referenced an earlier statement is 
nonactionable. This Court should enter partial summary judgment on the defamation claim to the 
extent it is based on Ms. Maxwell’s response. 


V. The defamation claim should be dismissed because the publication is substantially 
true. 


““TA] statement is substantially true if the statement would not “have a different effect on 
the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.” Franklin v. 


Daily Holdings, Inc., 21 N.Y.S.3d 6, 12 (App. Div. 2015) (quoting Biro v. Condé Nast, 883 F. 


Supp. 2d 441, 458 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Jewell v. NYP Holdings, Inc., 23 F. Supp. 2d 348, 


39 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page47 of 77 


366 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (quoting Fleckenstein v. Friedman, 193 N.E. 537, 538 (1934)))). Indeed, it 
is well settled in New York “that an alleged libel is not actionable if the published statement 
could have produced no worse an effect on the mind of a reader than the truth pertinent to the 
allegation.” /d. (internal quotations omitted). “When the truth is so near to the facts as published 
that fine and shaded distinctions must be drawn and words pressed out of their ordinary usage to 
sustain a charge of libel, no legal harm has been done.” Fleckenstein, 193 N.E. at 538. 

For the reasons articulated in Argument VI, the January 2015 statement is substantially 
true as matter of law. 

VI. Plaintiff cannot establish actual malice by clear and convincing evidence. 

A. Facts. 

The following numbered facts are not in dispute and are sequentially numbered following 
the undisputed facts cited earlier. See This Motion at J 1-36.

41 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page49 of 77 


such as “spa attendants,” are “seasonal” and work only when the club is open, i.e., between 
November 1| and Mother’s Day. EXHIBIT T at 72-73; EXHIBIT U at MAR-A-LAGO 0212; 
EXHIBIT V. Plaintiff was hired as a “seasonal” spa attendant to work at the Mar-a-Lago Club in 
the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17. 

41. Plaintiff represented herself as a masseuse for Jeffrey Epstein. While working at 
the Mar-a-Lago spa and reading a library book about massage, plaintiff met Ms. Maxwell. 
Plaintiff thereafter told her father that she got a job working for Jeffrey Epstein as a masseuse. 
EXHIBIT T at 79. Plaintiff's father took her to Epstein’s house on one occasion around that time, 
and Epstein came outside and introduced himself to Mr. Roberts. Jd. at 82-83. Plaintiff 
commenced employment as a traveling masseuse for Mr. Epstein. Plaintiff was excited about 
her job as a masseuse, about traveling with him and about meeting famous people. EXHIBIT L at 
56; EXHIBIT P at 126. Plaintiff represented that she was employed as a masseuse beginning in 
January 2001. EXHIBIT M; EXHIBIT N. Plaintiff never mentioned Ms. Maxwell to her then- 
fiancé, Austrich. EXHIBIT L at 74. Plaintiff's father never met Ms. Maxwell. EXHIBIT T at 85.

EXHIBIT Y. 


42 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page5SO of 77 


43. Plaintiff freely and voluntarily contacted the police to come to her aid in 2001 
and 2002 but never reported to them that she was Epstein’s “sex slave.” In August 2001 at 
age 17, while living in the same apartment, plaintiff and Figueroa hosted a party with a number 
of guests. EXHIBIT Z. During the party, according to plaintiff, someone entered plaintiff's room 
and stole $500 from her shirt pocket. /d. Plaintiff contacted the police. She met and spoke with 
police officers regarding the incident and filed a report. She did not disclose to the officer that 
she was a “sex slave.” A second time, in June 2002, plaintiff contacted the police to report that 
her former landlord had left her belongings by the roadside and had lit her mattress on fire. 
EXHIBIT AA. Again, plaintiff met and spoke with the law enforcement officers but did not 
complain that she was the victim of any sexual trafficking or abuse or that she was then being 
held as a “sex slave.” Id. 

44. From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein and Maxwell were almost 
entirely absent from Florida on documented travel unaccompanied by Plaintiff. Flight logs 
maintained by Epstein’s private pilot Dave Rodgers evidence the substantial number of trips 
away from Florida that Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Plaintiff, between August 
2001 and September 2002. EXHIBIT BB. Rodgers maintained a log of all flights on which Epstein 
and Maxwell traveled with him. EXHIBIT CC at 6-15. Epstein additionally traveled with another 
pilot who did not keep such logs and he also occasionally traveled via commercial flights. Jd. at 
99-100, 103. For substantially all of thirteen months of the twenty-two months (from November 
2000 until September 2002) that Plaintiff lived in Palm Beach and knew Epstein, Epstein was 
traveling outside of Florida unaccompanied by Plaintiff. EXHIBIT BB. During this same period of 


time, Plaintiff was employed at various jobs, enrolled in school, and living with her boyfriend. 


43 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page51 of 77 


45. Plaintiff and Figueroa shared a vehicle during 2001 and 2002. Plaintiff and 
Figueroa shared a ’93 white Pontiac in 2001 and 2002. EXHIBIT P at 67; EXHIBIT EE. Plaintiff 
freely traveled around the Palm Beach area in that vehicle. /d. In August 2002, Plaintiff acquired 
a Dodge Dakota pickup truck from her father. EXHIBIT P at 67-68. Figueroa used that vehicle in 
a series of crimes before and after Plaintiff left for Thailand. /d.; EXHIBIT FF. 

46. Plaintiff held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002. During 2001 and 2002, plaintiff 
was gainfully employed at several jobs. She worked as a waitress at Mannino’s Restaurant, at 
TGIFriday’s restaurant (aka CCI of Royal Palm Inc.), and at Roadhouse Grill. EXHIBIT R. She 
also was employed at Courtyard Animal Hospital (aka Mare Pinkwasser DVM). /d.; EXHIBIT W. 

47. In September 2002, Plaintiff traveled to Thailand to receive massage training 
and while there, met her future husband and eloped with him. Plaintiff traveled to Thailand 
in September 2002 to receive formal training as a masseuse. Figueroa drove her to the airport. 
While there, she initially contacted Figueroa frequently, incurring a phone bill of $4,000. 
EXHIBIT P at 35. She met Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and decided to marry him. She 
thereafter ceased all contact with Figueroa from October 2002 until two days before Mr. 
Figueroa’s deposition in this matter in May 2016. Id. at 29, 37. 

48. Detective Recarey’s investigation of Epstein failed to uncover any evidence that 
Ms. Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or 
possession of child pornography. Joseph Recarey served as the lead detective from the Palm 
Beach Police Department charged with investigating Jeffrey Epstein. EXHIBIT GG at 10. That 
investigation commenced in 2005. Jd. Recarey worked only on the Epstein case for an entire 
year. Id. at 274. He reviewed previous officers’ reports and interviews, conducted numerous 


interviews of witnesses and alleged victims himself, reviewed surveillance footage of the Epstein 


44 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page52 of 77 


home, participated in and had knowledge of the search warrant executed on the Epstein home, 
and testified regarding the case before the Florida state grand jury against Epstein. /d. at 212-15. 
Detective Recarey’s investigation revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein victims ever 
mentioned Ms. Maxwell’s name and she was never considered a suspect by the government. Jd. 
at 10-11, 177, 180-82, 187-96, 241-42, 278. None of Epstein’s alleged victims said they had 
seen Ms. Maxwell at Epstein’s house, nor said they had been “recruited by her,” nor paid any 
money by her, nor told what to wear or how to act by her. /d. Indeed, none of Epstein’s alleged 
victims ever reported to the government they had met or spoken to Ms. Maxwell. Jd. Maxwell 
was not seen coming or going from the house during the law enforcement surveillance of 
Epstein’s home. /d. at 214-215. The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell and her name 
was never mentioned before the grand jury. /d. at 203, 211. No property belonging to Maxwell, 
including “sex toys” or “child pornography,” was seized from Epstein’s home during execution 
of the search warrant. /d. at 257. Detective Recarey, when asked to describe “everything that you 
believe you know about Ghislaine Maxwell’s sexual trafficking conduct,” replied, “I don’t.” Jd. 
at 278. He confirmed he has no knowledge about Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking anybody. Jd. 
at 278-79. Detective Recarey also has no knowledge of Plaintiff's conduct that is subject of this 
lawsuit. Jd. at 259-60. 

49. No nude photograph of Plaintiff was displayed in Epstein’s home. Epstein’s 
housekeeper, Juan Alessi, “never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. Epstein’s 
house.” EXHIBIT HH at §j 17. Detective Recarey entered Epstein’s home in 2002 to install 
security cameras to catch a thief and did not observe any “child pornography” within the home, 


including on Epstein’s desk in his office. EXHIBIT GG at 289-90. 


45 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page53 of 77 


50. Plaintiff intentionally destroyed her “journal” and “dream journal” regarding 
her “memories” of this case in 2013 while represented by counsel. Plaintiff drafted a 
“journal” describing individuals to whom she claims she was sexually trafficked as well as her 
memories and thoughts about her experiences with Epstein. EXHIBIT II at 64-65, 194; EXHIBIT N 
at 205-08. In 2013, she and her husband created a bonfire in her backyard in Florida and burned 
the journal together with other documents in her possession. /d. Plaintiff also kept a “dream 
journal” regarding her thoughts and memories that she possessed in January 2016. EXHIBIT II at 
194-96. To date, Plaintiff cannot locate the “dream journal.” Id?! 

51. Plaintiff publicly peddled her story beginning in 2011. Plaintiff granted journalist 
Sharon Churcher extensive interviews that resulted in seven (7) widely distributed articles from 
March 2011 through January 2015. Churcher regularly communicated with plaintiff and her 
“attorneys or other agents” from “early 2011” to “the present day.” See Doc.216 §§ 2-11 and 
referenced exhibits; Doc.261-1 to 216-8, incorporated by reference. Plaintiff received 
approximately $160,000 for her stories and pictures that were published by many news 
organizations. EXHIBIT N at 247-48. 

52. Plaintiff drafted a 144-page purportedly autobiographical book manuscript in 
2011 which she actively sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous with her Churcher 
interviews, plaintiff drafted a book manuscript which purported to document plaintiff's 
experiences as a teenager in Florida, including her interactions with Epstein and Maxwell. 
EXHIBIT KK. Plaintiff communicated with literary agents, ghost writers and potential 


independent publishers in an effort to get her book published. She generated marketing materials 


5! Defendant has moved for sanctions against plaintiff premised on her admitted 
destruction of this evidence. Doc.509-510. 


46 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page54 of 77 


and circulated those along with book chapters to numerous individuals associated with 
publishing and the media. 

53. Plaintiff’s publicly filed “lurid” CVRA pleadings initiated a media frenzy and 
generated highly publicized litigation between her lawyers and Alan Dershowitz. On 
December 30, 2014, plaintiff, through counsel, publicly filed a joinder motion that contained her 
“lurid allegations” about Ms. Maxwell and many others, including Alan Dershowitz, Prince 
Andrew, Jean-Luc Brunel. The joinder motion was followed by a “corrected” motion (EXHIBIT 
D) and two further declarations in January and February 2015, which repeated many of 
plaintiff's claims. These CVRA pleadings generated a media maelstrom and spawned highly 
publicized litigation between plaintiff's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz. 
After plaintiff publicly alleged Mr. Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz vigorously 
defended himself in the media. He called plaintiff a liar and accused her lawyers of unethical 
conduct. In response, attorneys Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz who counterclaimed. 
This litigation, in turn, caused additional media attention by national and international media 
organizations. See Doc.363 at 363-1 through 363-14. 

54. Plaintiff formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to attract publicity and 
speak out on a public controversy. In 2014, plaintiff, with the assistance of the same counsel, 
formed a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to plaintiff, the purpose of 
the organization is to promote plaintiff's professed cause against sex slavery. The stated goal of 
her organization is to help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically 
experienced by victims of sexual abuse. EXHIBIT LL. Plaintiff attempts to promote Victims 


Refuse Silence at every opportunity. EXHIBIT MM at 17-18. For example, plaintiff participated 


47 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page55 of 77 


in an interview in New York with ABC to promote the charity and to get her mission out to the 
public. /d. at 28. 


B. Plaintiff carries the burden of proving actual malice by clear and convincing 
evidence. 


In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964), the Supreme Court 
recognized that our country has made a “profound national commitment to the principle that 
debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.” The overriding 
importance of that commitment led to the Court’s holding that “neither factual error nor 
defamatory content, nor a combination of the two, sufficed to remove the First Amendment 
shield,” Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 535 (2001), from speech relating to public officials 
and public figures. See, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 345 (1974). Under the 
First Amendment of the Constitution and Article I, Section 8, of the New York Constitution, in 
defamation actions by public officials and public figures and in defamation actions concerning 
matters of public concern, the plaintiff must prove that the allegedly defamatory statement was 
made with “actual malice.” See, e.g., id.; Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 
776-77 (1986); Huggins v. Moore, 726 N.E.2d 456, 460 (N.Y. 1999); McGill v. Parker, 582 
N.Y.S.2d 91, 97 (App. Div. 1992). 

As the Supreme Court has noted, the term “actual malice” can be confusing because in 
the First Amendment context “it has nothing to do with bad motive or ill will.” Harte-Hanks 
Communic’ns, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 666 n.7 (1989). Instead proof of actual malice 


p32 


requires evidence that the publication contains a “material’””” false statement of fact that was 


made “with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or 


°° 4ir Wisconsin Airlines Corp. v. Hoeper, 134 8. Ct. 852, 861 (2014) (“minor 
inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as ‘the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous 
charge be justified”) (internal quotations and brackets omitted). 


48 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page56 of 77 


not it was true.” Jd. at 667 (internal quotations omitted). Reckless disregard means the defendant 
made the false publication “with a high degree of awareness of probable falsity” or “entertained 
serious doubts as to the truth of [the] publication.” /d. (internal quotations omitted). 

In a defamation action, a plaintiff will be required to prove actual malice in two different 
and independent contexts: a defamation action in which the plaintiff is a public figure, and a 
defamation action in which the defendant asserts the privilege of reply. 

The defamation plaintiff at trial and in summary judgment proceedings must prove her 
case by clear and convincing evidence. 

C. Plaintiff is a public figure who must prove actual malice. 

Public figures include those who have “thrust themselves to the forefront of particular 
public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. . . . [T]hey invite 
attention and comment.” Gertz, 418 U.S. at 345. The essential element for a finding that a person 
is a public figure is that she has “taken an affirmative step to attract public attention,” has 
“strived to achieve a measure of public acclaim.” James v. Gannett Co., 353 N.E.2d 834, 876 
(N.Y. 1976). 

In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), the United States Supreme 
Court held that, in cases involving public officials, the interests of an individual are trumped by 
society's interest in promoting free press discussion of matters of general concern. Biro v. Condé 
Naste, 963 F. Supp. 2d 255, 269 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). Thus, the Court held that a public official 
alleging defamation must establish that a falsehood has been published with “actual malice.” 
Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 279-80; accord, Lerman v. Flynt Dist. Co., Inc., 745 F.3d 123, 136 (2d Cir. 
1984); Biro, 963 F. Supp. 2d at 269. Subsequently, the Supreme Court extended this standard to 
all public figures, Curtis Publ'g Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967), and decided in Gertz v. Robert 


Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974), that individuals that “are not public figures for all purposes 
49 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page57 of 77 


may still be public figures with respect to a particular controversy.” Contemporary Mission, Inc. 
v. N.Y. Times Co., 842 F.2d 612, 617 (2d Cir. 1988). 

As the Second Circuit has observed, the reason for distinguishing between private and 
public figures in defamation claims flows from the recognition of two things: First, “that private 
figure are more vulnerable to injury from defamation, because public figures have greater access 
to the media and thus are in a better position to contradict a lie or correct an error.” 
Contemporary Mission, Inc., 842 F.2d at 619-20. Second, “and more important, public figures 
generally ‘have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory 
falsehood concerning them.’” /d. at 620 (quoting N.Y. Times, 418 U.S. at 344-45) (emphasis 
added). 

In the Second Circuit, to establish that a plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure, a 
defendant must prove that she: 


1. successfully invited public attention to [her] views in an effort to influence others 
prior to the incident that is the subject of litigation; 


2. voluntarily injected [her]self into a public controversy related to the subject of the 
litigation; 


3. assumed a position of prominence in the public controversy; and 


4. maintained regular and continuing access to the media. 


Lerman, 745 F.2d at 136-37; accord, Contemporary Mission, Inc., 842 F.2d at 617; Biro, 963 F. 
Supp. 2d at 270. Statements regarding a limited purpose public figure are subject to enhanced 
protection only if relevant to the public figure's involvement in a given controversy. Biro, 963 F. 
Supp.2d at 270-71 (citing Faigin v. Kelly, 978 F. Supp. 420, 426 (D. N.H. 1997)). “Yet, once a 
plaintiff is deemed a limited purpose public figure, courts allow the heightened protections to 
sweep broadly, covering all statements by defendants that are not ‘wholly unrelated to the 


controversy.” Biro, 963 F. Supp. 2d at 271 (quoting Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publ'ns, Inc., 626 


50 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page58 of 77 


F.2d 1287, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). The law requires only that “the statement need be no more 
than generally related to a dispute in issue to qualify for protection.” Robert D. Sack, Sack on 
Defamation: Libel, Slander, and Related Problems (“SACK ON DEFAMATION”) § 5:3.3 (4th ed. 
2015). 

The question whether a plaintiff is a public figure is a question of law for the court to 
decide. Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enters. Inc., 209 F.3d 163, 176-77 (2d Cir. 2000); accord Biro, 
963 F. Supp. 2d at 270. 

1. Plaintiff successfully invited public attention to influence others. 

The record amply demonstrates that plaintiff invited public attention to herself and her 
views regarding the Plaintiff’s alleged desire to draw attention to the issue of her purported sex 
slavery. 

Beginning in at least 2011, the Plaintiff met with Sharon Churcher to promote her cause 
and economic interests. According to Ms. Churcher, the Plaintiff granted Ms. Churcher extensive 
interviews that resulted in 7 widely distributed articles from March 2011 through January 2015. 
According to Ms. Churcher, she regularly communicated with the Plaintiff and her “attorneys or 
other agents” from “early 2011” to “the present day.” See Doc.216 §§ 2-11 and referenced 
exhibits; Docs.261-1 to 216-8, incorporated by reference. Plaintiff was amply compensated for 
this “public attention” and received approximately $160,000 for her stories. and pictures that 
were published by many news organizations. EXHIBIT N at 247-248. Plaintiff had a contract with 
the news organizations, The Mail on Sunday. 

Plaintiff, in addition to selling this story to the media, again thrust herself into the 
public’s attention when she sought to join the ongoing CVRA litigation against Jeffrey Epstein in 
the United States District Court in Florida. The Plaintiff, through the same lawyers in this matter, 


publicly filed a joinder motion that was the equivalent of a press release. The unnecessary and 


Sl 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page59 of 77 


lurid allegations were ultimately stricken by the Court but accomplished the desired result for the 
Plaintiff, more public attention. The CVRA pleading created a media frenzy and spawned highly 
publicized litigation between Plaintiff's lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz. 
After the Plaintiff publicly alleged Mr. Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz 
vigorously defended himself in the media. He called the Plaintiff a liar and accused her lawyers 
of unethical conduct. In response, the lawyers, Edwards and Cassell, sued Dershowitz who 
counterclaimed. This litigation, in turn, caused additional media attention by national and 
international media organizations. See Doc.363 at 363-1 thorough 363-14 and accompanying 
exhibits. 

In addition, plaintiff claims to have established a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse 
Silence, the purpose of which was to promote plaintiffs professed cause against sex slavery. 

In paragraphs 23 through 26 of her complaint in this matter she makes the following 


admissions on this issue: 


e Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that she 
should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who 
had also suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse. Jd. 23 


e On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims Refuse 
Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation. Jd. 24 


e  Géiuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against 
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues 
to be, to help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically 
experienced by victims of sexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional 
life to helping victims of sex trafficking. Jd. 25 


e On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously 
filed by Jane Doe | in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein’s non- 
prosecution agreement by filing her own joinder motion. Jd. 26 


§2 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page60 of 77 


In sum, the record includes ample evidence of plaintiff's efforts to garner public attention 
in order to influence others and the success of those efforts. 


2. Plaintiff voluntarily injected herself into public controversies related to the 
subject of this litigation. 


The second prong of the Lerman test requires an examination of whether plaintiff 
voluntarily injected herself into a public controversy related to the subject of the litigation. The 
Second Circuit has held that the term should be defined broadly to mean “any topic upon which 
sizeable segments of society have different, strongly held views.” Lerman, 745 F.2d at 138; see 
also Biro, 963 F. Supp. 2d at 272 (“A public controversy is simply ‘any topic upon which 
sizeable segments of society have different, strongly held views,” even if the topic does ‘not 
involve political debate or criticism of public officials.””) (quoting Lerman, 745 F.2d at 138) 
(alteration omitted). The public controversy requirement, however, is not necessarily limited to 
what would be considered “‘a classic debate.” SACK ON DEFAMATION § 5:3.11[B]. “An 
investigation into alleged corruption or drug dealing, for example, could meet the test.” Jd. 

As demonstrated by the Declaration of Ms. Churcher, the articles attached to the 
declaration, and the joinder motion filed by plaintiff in the CVRA litigation and the litigation 
initiated by her lawyers there can be no doubt that the plaintiff's actions were voluntary and that 
she injected herself into this “public controversy.” Indeed, it is clear that plaintiff created this 
“public controversy.” 

3. Plaintiff assumed a position of prominence in the public controversies. 


The third relevant factor focuses on whether plaintiff has voluntarily assumed a sufficient 
degree of prominence in the controversies at issue. Plaintiff sold and published her story. She 


publicly sought to join the CVRA litigation. She established a non-profit organization, the 


53 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page61 of 77 


mission of which is purportedly to “spread the word for victims of human trafficking”. EXHIBIT 
MM at 17; see also EXHIBIT LL. 

According to Brittany Henderson, the Rule 30(b)(6) designee of VRS, plaintiff has 
“continued to try to promote Victims Refuse Silence at every possible chance she gets ...” 
EXHIBIT MM at 17-18. Plaintiff participated in an interview in New York with ABC in “the 
beginning of 2015,” id. at 27, so that she could “promote the charity, so that she could start 
getting her mission out to the public.” /d. at 28. Having affirmatively injected herself into the 
public spotlight in connection with these issues, plaintiff cannot now be heard to argue that this 
Lerman factor has not been satisfied. Cf’ Contemporary Mission, 842 F.2d at 618-19 (finding the 
plaintiffs' assertion that they have assumed a private life was “belied by the fact that they 
continued to thrust themselves into the public eye” through their conduct on behalf of a non-for- 
profit organization). 

4. Plaintiff has maintained regular and continuing access to the media. 

Plaintiff has had substantial access to the media. Ms. Churcher has answered every call or 
email sent by plaintiff. Plaintiff's lawyers have regularly communicated with the media. Plaintiff 
and her lawyers have been interviewed by numerous major media organizations. 

Accordingly, the First Amendment requires that public figures like plaintiff claiming 
defamation must establish actual malice—actual and material falsity or a high degree of 
awareness of probable falsity—by clear and convincing evidence. E.g., Masson v. New Yorker 
Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 510 (1991). 


D. Plaintiff must also prove actual malice to overcome the defenses of reply and 
pre-litigation privilege. 


The qualified privilege of reply to a defamatory attack is a complete defense to a claim of 


defamation. Shenkman v. O'Malley, 157 N.Y.S.2d 290, 294, 297 (App. Div. 1956). The defense 


54 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page62 of 77 


is available to a person “who has been defamed in the first instance,” here, Ms. Maxwell, and 
“who, in response to the attack, responds in kind.” /d. The privilege of the initially-attacked 
person (Ms. Maxwell) includes in rebuttal of the initial attack the right to speak the truth, but the 
right to rebut is not confined to the truth or to mere denial: 

This defense of reply is material, of course, only where the response in kind is 


defamatory. The injury, if any, to plaintiff is excused, because it is the plaintiff 
who started the altercation. ... 


It is a contradiction in terms to say that the one attacked is a privileged only to 
speak the truth, and not to make a counter attack, or that legitimate self-defense 
consists only in a denial of the charge or a statement of what is claimed to be the 
truth respecting its subject-matter. 


Id. (emphasis supplied; quoting Collier v. Postum Cereal Co., 134 N.Y.S. 847, 853 (1 Dep’t 
1912)); see generally Restatement of the Law of Torts (Second) § 594 cmt. k (1977) (noting that 
to protect her reputation from attack by another person, she is conditionally privileged to publish 
defamatory matter about her attacker reasonably believed necessary to defend her reputation, 
“including the statement that [her] accuser is an unmitigated liar”). 

A defendant asserting the defense of reply need only establish she has been attacked with 
a defamatory statement. See id. at 297. Beginning no later than 2009 plaintiff attacked 
Ms. Maxwell with defamatory statements. In 2014, plaintiff knew the press was giving extensive 
coverage to, and scrutinizing all filings in, the Crime Victim’s Rights Act case pending in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and in plaintiffs 2009 civil 
action against Mr. Epstein. Knowing this, plaintiff repeatedly filed papers in court alleging that 
Ms. Maxwell participated as a “recruiter” in a “sex trafficking” scheme operated by Mr. Epstein. 
E.g., Exhibit D. In 2011, plaintiff granted “exclusive” interviews to the British tabloid press 
during which she repeated her false allegations against Ms. Maxwell and also alleged that as part 


of the “sex trafficking” scheme she had sex with numerous prominent public figures, including 


55 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page63 of 77 


Prince Andrew and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. EXHIBIT A. The false allegations 
against Ms. Maxwell constituted defamation per se. 

A plaintiff may defeat a qualified privilege only by proving actual malice. See, e.g., Kane 
v. Orange Cnty. Publ’ns, 649 N.Y.S.2d 23, 26 (App. Div. 1996) (qualified privilege of reply); 
see generally Gertz, 418 U.S. at 323; Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, § 594 cmt. b. 


E. The January 2015 statement was substantially true, and plaintiff cannot 
produce clear and convincing evidence of its falsity. 


The January 2015 statement accurately and properly denies the factual assertions 
regarding Ms. Maxwell contained within plaintiff's joinder motion that had been issued two days 
prior to which it responded. With respect to each claim in the joinder motion that concerns Ms. 
Maxwell, the evidence elicited through discovery undercuts any evidence — clear and convincing 
or otherwise — that plaintiff may proffer to buttress her false allegations. 


1. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that Ms. Maxwell met 
Plaintiff when Plaintiff was 15 years old in 1999. 


Plaintiff's relative youth at the time of her initial contact with Epstein and Maxwell forms 
the core of Plaintiff’s story, in her joinder motion and in the press, that she was an underage 
victim of sexual slavery. Plaintiff has made a point of mentioning her age of 15, in the year 1999, 
as the starting point for her “four years” of “sex slavery” at every opportunity. The young age no 
doubt heightens the offensiveness of the claimed abusive conduct and also supplies enough time 
to allow for the “thousands” of times she was purportedly abused and the numerous opportunities 
for her to be trafficked to countless famous individuals. Reiterating this point in the joinder 
motion, plaintiff asserted again that she met Ms. Maxwell in the year 1999 when she was a mere 
15 years old. EXHIBIT D at 3. 

As she now admits and her employment records confirm, plaintiff did not actually meet 


Ms. Maxwell or Epstein until the year 2000. Plaintiff acknowledges that she did not meet Ms. 


56 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page64 of 77 


Maxwell until she worked at the Mar-A-Lago as a spa attendant, and she confirms that she 
obtained that job with the assistance of her father who already was employed as a maintenance 
worker at the club. Records subpoenaed from Mar-A-Lago reflect that plaintiff's father 
commenced employment on April 11, 2000. ExHiBiT S. Additionally, they show that plaintiff 
terminated in the year 2000. /d. Finally, plaintiff's social security report confirms plaintiff's 
Mar-a-lago employment was confined to calendar year 2000. EXHIBIT R. Faced with 
overwhelming proof that her claims of meeting Ms. Maxwell at the age of 15 in the year 1999 
were false, plaintiff finally conceded as much at her deposition on May 3, 2016. EXHIBIT N at 25- 
28. She also confessed that she did not spend her “sweet 16"” birthday with Ms. Maxwell, as 
detailed in her book manuscript and in the press. Compare EXHIBIT N at 101-02 with EXHIBIT 
KK at Giuffre04173 (“I spent my sweet 16" birthday on his island in the Caribbean next to ‘St. 
James Isle’ he liked to call it ‘Little St. Jeff's’, his ego was as enormous as his appetite for 
fornicating. I was given a birthday cake and a new collection of designer make-up from London. 
Ghislaine made a joke after I blew out my array of candles and said, ‘I’d be soon getting too old 
for Jeffrey’s taste, and soon they'd have to trade me in.””); Paul Lewis, “Jeffrey Epstein: Inside 
the Decade of Scandal Entangling Prince Andrew,” The Guardian (Jan. 10, 2015)**. 

Yet, even after conceding she was off by a year, plaintiff persists in suggesting that she 
must have been a mere “16 year old” when she worked at Mar-a-Lago and met Ms. Maxwell. It 
was, she testified, a “summer job” for which she had taken a break from school, and she did not 
turn 17 until later that summer on August 9, 2000. EXHIBIT N at 25-28, 57,104, 113. But the 
Mar-a-Lago documents conclusively disprove this claim: the spa where plaintiff worked closes 


every year from Mother’s Day until November 1. EXHIBIT U at Mar-a-Lago0212 (“The club 


33 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/jeffrey-epstein-decade-scandal- 
prince-andrew (last visited Jan. 6, 2017). 





S7 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page65 of 77 


never shuts down from November | to Mother’s Day.”). Spa attendants such as plaintiff are 
“seasonal” employees. Jd. Indeed, the spa advertises for its new employees in local newspapers 
in the fall of every year. EXHIBIT V. Even plaintiff's father — a long time employee of Mar-a- 
Lago -- described the seasonal nature of the club during his deposition: “[Plaintiff’s 
employment] was probably for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. I mean, I was there 
year round but a lot of people are seasonal, you know, because it’s like snowbirds, you know, 
summertime comes and nobody wants to be down in south Florida....[The season is] probably 
from September or October to, you know, maybe May, I guess.” EXHIBIT T at 72. With the spa 
closed from Mother’s Day to November 1, plaintiff could not have had a “summer job” and 
could not have worked at Mar-a-Lago until November 2000, at the earliest, when she was over 
17 years old. 

In sum, Plaintiff's claim in the Joinder Motion that she met Ghislaine Maxwell in 1999 
when she was 15 years old is a false statement. Therefore, the January 2015 statement calls the 
allegations against her “untrue” was factually accurate. 

2. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that Ms. Maxwell “regularly 
participate[d] in Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors” and that “the 
Government knows” such fact. 

The January 2015 statement also accurately denied plaintiff's joinder motion allegation 
that “it became known to the government that Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein’s 
sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane Doe #3.” EXHIBIT D at 3. Ms. Maxwell did not 
“regularly participate in in Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors” as confirmed by the lead 
Palm Beach Detective, Joseph Recarey. Det. Recarey confirmed that none of the alleged Epstein 
victims ever mentioned Ms. Maxwell’s name, either in reports he reviewed or in interviews he 
conducted. None of the alleged victims said they had been “recruited,” paid or exploited by Ms. 


Maxwell. EXHIBIT GG at 10-11, 177, 180-82, 187-96, 241-42, 278. He verified that the twenty- 
58 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page66 of 77 


two page Palm Beach Police Department affidavit does not mention Ms. Maxwell’s name once 
(id. at 177), and she was never considered a suspect and she was never mentioned in the grand 
jury testimony. /d. at 203. Ms. Maxwell was not seen coming or going from the house during 
any of the Palm Beach Police Department’s surveillance of Epstein’s home. Jd. at 214-15. None 
of her property was seized from Epstein’s home. /d. at 257. In sum, Det. Recarey denied that 
knowing anything “about Ghislaine Maxwell’s sexual trafficking conduct.” /d. at 278. He 
confirmed he has no knowledge that Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking “anybody.” Jd. at 278-79. 
Likewise, he has no knowledge of Plaintiff's conduct that is subject of this lawsuit. Jd. at 259-60. 
Plaintiff thus has uncovered no evidence that the “government” came to “know” that Maxwell 
participated in sexual exploitation of Jane Doe #3, i-e., Plaintiff. Plaintiff has not and cannot 
present clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate the falsity of Ms. Maxwell’s denial. 

3. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that “with [Ms. Maxwell’s] 
assistance, [Epstein] converted [Plaintiff] into what is commonly referred to 
as a ‘sex slave.’” 

Plaintiff claimed in the joinder motion that Ms. Maxwell helped Epstein transform her 
into a “sex slave” as that term is “commonly” used, yet the incontrovertible evidence establishes 
the opposite. A “slave” as defined by Merriam-Webster is a “person held in servitude as the 
chattel of another.” Oxford Dictionary defines “slave” as a “person who is the legal property of 
another and is forced to obey them.” Common definitions of “sex slave” include a person who is 
confined and is raped, sexually abused or prostituted. See “Sex Slave,” Free Dictionary, located 
at http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sex+slave (last visited Jan. 5, 2017) (underlining supplied). 
Plaintiff, however, was far from confined or the legal property of another. 

Throughout 2000, 2001 and 2002, Plaintiff enjoyed complete freedom of movement and 
choice. She had a car and then a pickup truck she shared with Figueroa. EXHIBIT P at 67.. She 


traveled freely to and from multiple jobs working as a waitress, bird aviaries, veterinarian 


59 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page67 of 77 


hospital, Neiman Marcus, Oasis Outsourcing and Southeast Employee Management Company. 
EXHIBIT R. Plaintiff enrolled in school in June 2000 before she met Maxwell or Epstein and 
continued her enrollment throughout 2000, 2001 and until March 2002. ExHiBiIT O. She worked 
at multiple restaurants and the animal hospital in 2002. EXHIBIT R. She came and went from her 
apartment, moved to a new apartment and then moved in with Figueroa’s family. She held 
parties at her apartment with Figueroa and other friends. EXHIBIT Z. When something did not go 
well, she called the police and filed police reports, without mentioning anything about captivity, 
confinement or forced sexual exploitation or trafficking, much less “sex slavery.” Jd. and 
EXHIBIT AA. She had her own money, paid her rent, and bought a vehicle. To Figueroa, she 
seemed “excited” about meeting famous people and discussed it so much that he tuned it out. 
EXHIBIT P at 125-26. By any commonly understood definition of sex slavery, Plaintiff did not 
match the description. 

Witness testimony and documentary evidence demonstrate the absence of substantial 
truth to Plaintiff's claim that Maxwell assisted Epstein in converting her into what is commonly 
referred to as a “sex slave.” The January 2015 statement’s denial of that claim cannot therefore 
be defamatory. 


4. The January 2015 statement accurately reported that Plaintiff alleged 
“sexual relations” with Professor Dershowitz which he denied. 


The January 2015 statement accurately reports that “now it is alleged that Alan 
Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with [Plaintiff], which he denies.” The 
joinder motion made such a claim and Professor Dershowitz publicly and vehemently denied any 


such sexual contact. See, e.g., Dershowitz Denies Sex Charge, JTA (Jan. 2, 2015) (“Dershowitz 


60 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page68 of 77 


declared ‘totally, unequivocally and completely false’ allegations that he had sex with the former 
staffer for investor Jeffrey Epstein.”).** 

Professor Dershowitz has gone beyond a simple denial: he has sworn, repeatedly and in 
almost every conceivable forum, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and 
Good Morning America, that he never had any sexual contact with Plaintiff and never met her. 
As he set forth in this case in his Declaration in Support of Motion to Intervene, Plaintiff never 
mentioned his name during her weeklong 2011 interview with journalist Sharon Churcher. 
Doc.363. It was only after Churcher suggested to Plaintiff that she “must have” met Dershowitz 
because “we all know he’s a pedo, though we have no proof of that” that Plaintiff then included 
Dershowitz in her book manuscript, not as a perpetrator of hers, but as someone she had “met” 
while with Epstein. /d. The CVRA joinder motion more than three years later was the first time 
plaintiff publicized her remarkable claim that she had been sexually trafficked to Dershowitz on 


“numerous occasions” “while she was a minor,” in Florida, private planes, in New York, New 
Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. EXHIBIT D. 

Dershowitz, in his own subsequent defamation action against plaintiff's attorneys 
Edwards and Cassell, produced approximately 10,000 pages of documents capturing his travels 
during the 1999-2002 timeframe, none of which coincided with Plaintiffs story. For example, 
Dershowitz demonstrated that the only time he visited Epstein’s home in the U.S. Virgin Islands 
he was accompanied by his wife and his 12 year old daughter. Plaintiff, on the other hand, 
produced no records demonstrating that any portion of her allegation against him is true. For 
example, she claimed one sexual encounter occurred on a private plane on which she traveled

61 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page69 of 77 


with Professor Dershowitz. EXHIBIT II at 85. None of the flight logs reveal a flight with the two 
of them as passengers. EXHIBIT BB. Another time, plaintiff claims, she and Epstein flew together 
to Boston and she engaged in sexual relations with Professor Dershowitz in the backseat of a 
limousine between the airport and his home with another female and Epstein next to them. 
EXHIBIT I at 110-15. No flight logs document any trip with Epstein and plaintiff to Boston and 
plaintiff cannot recall the other female in the car. EXHIBIT II at 113. 

Professor Dershowitz has signed affidavits, provided sworn deposition testimony and 
sworn pleadings, offered to take a lie detector test, offered to waive the statute of limitations as 
to himself, and given countless broadcast and news interviews disclaiming any sexual contact 


with Plaintiff and calling her an outright “Liar5 


The January 2015 statement recounting the 
allegation against him and his denial is substantially true. 
5. The January 2015 statement accurately denied that Ms. Maxwell created 


and distributed child pornography and that the Government knows of and 
possesses such child pornography. 


Plaintiff's next assertion regarding Maxwell in the joinder motion was that “Maxwell also 
took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including 
Jane Doe #3,” and that Maxwell “shared these photographs (which constituted child pornography 
under applicable federal laws) with Epstein.” EXHIBIT D at 4-5. Plaintiff continued: the 
“Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these 
photographs.” /d. Yet again, the evidence demonstrates the falsity of Plaintiff's claim. 

Detective Recarey testified that none of Epstein’s alleged victims even mentioned Ms. 
Maxwell, much less claimed that she had taken naked photographs of them. EXHIBIT GG at 180- 


82, 187-96, 241-42, 278. Recarey also denied that any evidence belonging to Ms. Maxwell was 


*>Perhaps most telling, Plaintiff and her phalanx of attorneys have never sued 
Mr. Dershowitz for his many vociferous attacks on her credibility. 


62 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page70 of 77 


seized from Epstein’s home during the execution of the search warrant, which would include any 
“child pornography” reportedly created by her. /d. at 257. Detective Recarey who had entered 
Epstein’s home in 2002 to install security cameras to catch a thief did not observe any “child 
pornography” within the home, including on Epstein’s desk where Plaintiff alleges he kept such 
a nude photograph of herself. /d. at 289-90. And Epstein’s housekeeper, Juan Alessi, swore that 
he “never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. Epstein’s house,” EXHIBIT HH at § 17, 
contradicting Plaintiff's claims that nude photographs of her were prominently displayed 
throughout all of Epstein’s homes. 

No sexually explicit photographs of Plaintiff were ever produced in discovery in this case 
or subpoenaed by Plaintiff from any governmental agency. Plaintiff has presented no evidence 
the government “possesses” any such photographs or indeed ever became "aware of" them. 


6. January 2015 statement accurately denied Maxwell acted as “madame” for 
Epstein to traffic Plaintiff to the rich and famous. 


Finally, in the joinder motion, Plaintiff asserted that Ms. Maxwell had “facilitated” sexual 
abuse “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein, thereby assisting in internationally trafficking Jane 
Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual purposes.” Plaintiff has utterly failed to 
substantiate her allegation. 

Not a single “other young girl” made a claim that Maxwell, or even Epstein for that 
matter, trafficked them to a third-person for commercial sexual acts. Detective Recarey 
confirmed that he had no knowledge of Ghislaine Maxwell sexually trafficking anyone. EXHIBIT 
GG at 278-79. He also confirmed that not a single one of the alleged victims of Epstein ever 
claimed to have any sexual contact with any man other than Epstein, or that they were sent to 
another location to have sex with another man or to give a massage to another man. /d. at 300- 


02. None of the other alleged victims of Epstein ever claimed to have gone on his plane with him 


63 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page71 of 77 


or to have had sexual acts with him on his plane. Jd. at 302-04. None claimed they had gone to 
New York with him and stayed in his residence. /d. at 304-05. Plaintiff, it appears, is the only 
alleged victim of Epstein who claims she was the subject of such trafficking, yet even she has 
retracted, amended, and withdrawn many of her allegations, thus rendering (by her own 
admission) such claim substantially untrue. 

Foreign Presidents. Upon questioning under oath, Plaintiff admitted that she had never 
even met a “foreign president,” much less ever been sexually trafficked to one or to the multiple 
“foreign presidents” referenced in the joinder motion. 


Q: The reference there to foreign presidents, do you see that? 

A: Yes. 

Q: You were sexually trafficked to foreign presidents? 

A: No. 

Q: So that’s not true, you were not sexually trafficked to foreign presidents? 
A: I don’t know what foreign presidents you’re talking about. 

Q: Have you ever been sexually trafficked to any foreign president? 
[Objection interposed by Ms. McCawley; Special Master overruled] 


A: L understand well-known prime ministers and other world leaders; as far as 
foreign presidents, I’m not too sure, I don’t know. 


Q: Have you ever met any foreign presidents? 
A: Foreign presidents as in overseas? 

Q: Sure, okay, overseas. 

A: No. 


Q: Have you ever met any foreign presidents from countries not overseas such as 
Canada or Mexico? 


A: No. 
Q: So you were not sexually trafficked to any foreign presidents, is that correct? 
A: As far as I know right now, yes. 


64 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page72 of 77 


Q: It’s correct that you were not sexually trafficked to them, right? 
A: You’ve asked me this three times and I’m telling you. 


EXHIBIT II at 10-12. Indeed, Plaintiff became frustrated by what she perceived as the third time 
she was asked the question, each time denying that she had met a foreign president or been 
sexually trafficked to one, clearly indicating that she understood the question, had answered it in 
the negative and did not want to be re-asked the question again.*° Notably, not a single “foreign 
president” is listed as a witness with knowledge of Plaintiff's claims in her Rule 26 disclosures. 

“Well-known prime minister.” Plaintiff also has failed to establish any evidence to 
support her fantastical claim that she was sexually trafficked to a “well-known prime minister.” 
When questioned, she refused to disclose the identity of the prime minister, even with the 
protection of a protective order. EXHIBIT IL at 12. She has not produced photographs of her with 
any well-known prime minister, nor any flight log showing a well-known prime minister on 
Epstein’s airplane. She has not identified herself as being in any location with a well-known 
prime minister, nor the date of any such encounter. The only evidence that Plaintiff has ever been 
even in the company of a well-known prime minister is her uncorroborated word. 

“World leaders.” Likewise, when asked about “world leaders” to whom she was 
trafficked, Plaintiff referred vaguely to someone she was introduced to as a “prince.” 


Q: Other world leaders, what other world leaders were you sexually trafficked to? 
[Objection interposed and overruled by Special Master] 

A: Okay. Prince Andrew for one. 

Q: Other than Prince Andrew? 


**Plaintiff and her counsel later devised a plan to just outright change these three answers 
through the errata sheet, claiming that Plaintiff had “misunderstood the question” and she had in 
fact been trafficked to such a president. EXHIBIT JJ. As her clear answers and frustration at the 
repeated nature of the questioning demonstrates, however, she had no trouble whatsoever 
understanding the question at the time.

A: There is another individual that I honestly do not know his name. 
Q: What country is he from? 


A: I’m not too sure, he spoke in a foreign—he did speak foreign tongue, he spoke 
English as well, but I’m not too sure where he was from? 


Q: How do you know he is a world leader? 


A: I was introduced to him as a prince. 


Q: Did you — where were you when you met him? 


A: On this occasion the South of France. 


Q: Where in the South of France were you? 

A: I don’t know. 

Q: Were you on a boat, were you in a house? 

A: We were at a like a cabana, not cabana, like a resort, but it was a big party. 
Q: Who was throwing the party? 

A: I don’t know. I was just brought there. 


EXHIBIT II at 15-17. Indeed, this is almost the identical answer that Plaintiff later gave when 
questioned about what which “powerful businessmen” she had been sent to have sex with: 


Q: Where were you sent to have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain by 
Ghislaine Maxwell? 


A: I believe that was one time in France. 


Q: I believe it was around the same time that Naomi Campbell had a birthday 
party. 


A: Where did you have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain in France around 
the time of Naomi Campbell’s birthday party? 


A: In his own cabana townhouse thing. It was part of a hotel, but I wouldn’t call it 
a hotel. ... 


66 


Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page74 of 77 


EXHIBIT N at 203. In fact, Naomi Campbell’s birthday is May 22, 1970. [WIKIPEDIA]. The 
flight logs do not show plaintiff traveling to France in May 2001 or May 2002. EXHIBIT BB at 
DR_0046, DR_0056. On May 22, 2002, for example, Epstein was in Russia. 

In her joinder motion, Plaintiff made the additional claim that Epstein (not Maxwell) 
sexually trafficked her to “model scout” Jean Luc Brunel on numerous occasions and in 
numerous places, including “the South of France.” EXHIBIT D at 5-6. The flight logs, however, 
demonstrate that Plaintiff was never in the “south of France,” much less on multiple occasions. 
The one and only trip reflecting travel by Plaintiff to France was a trip on March 6, 2001 from a 
fueling stop in Canada to Paris, followed by a departure from Paris on March 8, 2001 to 
Granada. EXHIBIT BB at DR_000043; EXHIBIT CC at 107. Although there are other flights in 
which Epstein went to Nice in the south of France, Plaintiff is not on any of them and none are 
near Naomi Campbell’s birthday on May 22. 

Plaintiff's claim in her joinder motion about having been trafficked to other “prominent 
American politicians” and other world leaders have gone unsubstantiated and are patently 
incredible. Because these men are publicized to have been in the company of Epstein on at least 
one occasion, such was apparently sufficient for Plaintiff to claim she had been trafficked to 
them. For example, Plaintiff claimed at her deposition that these powerful men to whom she was 
trafficked included Marvin Minsky. EXHIBIT N at 204. Dr. Minsky, a world-renowned scholar 
and long-time professor at MIT, passed away in January 2016 at the age of 88. *” At the time of 
his passing, he had been married to his wife, pediatrician Dr. Gloria Rudisch, since 1952 and had 
three children and four grandchildren. His name appears on one of Epstein’s flight logs as having 


traveled with a large group of individuals, including plaintiff, from New Jersey to Santa Fe on

Case 18-2868, Document 276, 08/09/2019, 2628224, Page75 of 77 


March 29 and returning on March 31, 2001.** The other passengers included world-renowned 
philanthropist Dr. Henry Jarecki, now aged 83, also a long-time husband, famed academic and 
scholar, and famous philanthropist.” 

Plaintiff produced no evidence substantiating any of her fantastical claims that she had 
been trafficked by Epstein, or by Maxwell, to any of these men or any others. No witnesses 
vouched for seeing plaintiff in the company of politicians George Mitchell or Bill Richardson to 
whom plaintiff claims she was sent. She produced no photographs of herself with them. She had 
a journal where she claims she documented their names, but she claims she burned that journal in 
2013. In May 2011, plaintiff inquired by email to journalist Sharon Churcher to “remind” her of 
the famous people to whom she was trafficked. Plaintiff has not supported her claims with clear 
and convincing evidence and thus, Ms. Maxwell’s denials and characterizations of these claims 
as “obvious lies” is not defamatory as a matter of law. 

CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of 


Ms. Maxwell. 


*8 Plaintiff claims, however, that she was trafficked to Dr. Minsky in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

Before the Court reaches the question whether plaintiff can prove falsity and actual 
malice, it should decide three questions of law, one that narrows considerably the legal issues 
and two that dispose of the case entirely. 

1. It is undisputed Ms. Maxwell, through her agents, sent to various media- 
representatives—and to no one else—the January 2015 statement. It is undisputed she had no 
control over any of the media that decided to republish excerpts from the statement. On these 
facts, under black letter New York law, she is not responsible for these republications. Plaintiffs 
contrary argument relies on a “foreseeability” doctrine the New York Court of Appeals has 
specifically rejected. Summary judgment should enter in favor of Ms. Maxwell as to any 
republication. 

2. Under the New York Constitution, whether a statement is constitutionally 
nonactionable opinion depends upon, among other things, an examination of the full context of 
the communication and consideration of the setting surrounding it. The January 2015 statement, 
making no reference to specific allegations, explains why the author believes plaintiff's 
allegations are “obvious lies”: “Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious 
details... .” It is an expression of a venerable opinion: when a person falsely cries wolf 
previously, others are free to opine she is telling falsehoods now. This is nonactionable opinion. 

3. Under New York law, a statement made pertinent to good faith anticipated litigation is 
nonactionable. The statement was sent exclusively to the media representatives, and contained a 
clear message: the media should not republish plaintiff's “obvious lies,” else Ms. Maxwell would 
sue them. Such a statement is nonactionable. 

If the Court reaches the question of falsity and actual malice, the Rule 56 record 


establishes plaintiff cannot prove falsity and actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.

Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page7 of 37 


ARGUMENT 
I. Ms. Maxwell is not liable for republications of the January 2015 statement. 

Under black letter New York law, liability for republication of an allegedly defamatory 
statement “must be based on real authority to influence the final product.” Davis v. Costa- 
Gavras, 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1096 (S.D.N.Y. 1984). “[WJhere a defendant ‘had no actual part in 
composing or publishing,’ he cannot be held liable.” Jd. (citing Folwell v. Miller, 145 F. 495, 497 
(2d Cir. 1906)); accord Geraci v. Probst, 938 N.E.2d 917, 921 (N.Y. 2010). “[CJonclusive 
evidence of lack of actual authority [is] sufficiently dispositive that the {trial court] ‘ha[s] no 
option but to dismiss the case... .”” Id. (emphasis supplied; quoting Rinaldi v. Viking Penguin, 
Inc., 420 N.E.2d 377, 382 (N.Y. 1981)). 

It is undisputed Ms. Maxwell and her agents had no ability to control and did not control 
whether or how the media-recipients would use the statement. Doc. 542-7, Ex.J {ff 2-3; id., Ex.K 
{| 24. Unsurprisingly, plaintiff has offered no evidence of such control. A fortiori this Court 
“ha[s] no option but to dismiss the case,” id. (internal quotations omitted), to the extent it is 
founded upon the media’s republication of the statement. 

A. Plaintiff’s argument against summary judgment is substantially groundless. 

A legal argument is frivolous if it is presented contrary to a “long line of authorities” and 
the “fundamental principles”! of the underlying substantive law. Plaintiff Giuffre’s argument 
opposing summary judgment as to republication is frivolous. 

The New York Court of Appeals in Geraci followed a long line of New York cases 
holding that a defamation defendant is not liable for republication of his allegedly defamatory 
statement unless he had “‘actual authority” to control the decision to republish: “Our 


‘Porky Prods. v. Nippon Exp. U.S.A., | F.Supp.2d 227, 234 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff'd, 152 
F.3d 920 (2d Cir, 1998). 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page8 of 37 


republication liability standard has been consistent for more than one hundred years.” See 
Geraci, 938 N.E.2d at 921 (footnote omitted). Indeed, the Geraci court observed, the New York 
Court of Appeals in Schoepflin v. Coffey, a case decided in 1900, held: 


“Tt is too well settled to be now questioned that one who . . . prints and publishes a 
libel[] is not responsible for its voluntary and unjustifiable repetition, without his 
authority or request, by others over whom he has no control and who thereby 
make themselves liable to the person injured, and that such repetition cannot be 
considered in law a necessary, natural and probable consequence of the original 
slander or libel.” 


938 N.E.2d at 921 (emphasis supplied; quoting Schoepflin, 56 N.E. at 504). 
The cases in which this Court and its sister courts in this Circuit assiduously have 


followed this line of New York cases are legion.’ The Second Circuit was in the vanguard.*

[republish] and [he] had no control over it.’”) (quoting Rinaldi v. Viking Penguin, Inc., 425

upon evidence of acquiescence or peripheral involvement in the republication process.”); Davis,

libelous matter and its republication], and could not have had any actual part in composing or 
publishing, we think he cannot be held liable without disregarding the settled rule of law by 
which no man is bound for the tortious act of another over whom he has not a master’s power of 
control”) (emphasis supplied), quoted with approval in Davis I, 580 F. Supp. at 1096; Cerasani, 
991 F. Supp. at 351. 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page9 of 37 


In the face of this uninterrupted line of New York state (and federal) cases dating back to 
the nineteenth century powerfully establishing a bright line rule regarding republication liability, 
plaintiff Giuffre manages what amounts to a—frivolous—murmur of opposition. She claims 
there are “[t]wo standards” in New York law: one “older,” and one “more modern.” Resp. 28. 
The “older” standard, plaintiff says, is represented by the legion of cases we have cited. The 
“more modern formulation”—where can it be found? Why, in one place: a treatise on 
defamation. Jd. (citing Sack on Defamation § 2.7.2, at 2-113 to -114 (4" ed. 2016). It surely is 
frivolous to argue that a treatise creates a republication-liability standard that is separate from, 
“more modern” than, and supersedes the New York Court of Appeals’ 2010 decision in Geraci 
and this Court’s 2012 decision in Egiazaryan. 

Trying to build on this start, plaintiff argues, “New York appellate courts have repeatedly 
held than an individual is liable for the media publishing that individual’s defamatory press 
release.” Resp. 28 (emphasis supplied). Even if we accept plaintiff's mischaracterization of the 
January 2015 statement as a “press release,” her argument still would be meritless. To begin 
with, when plaintiff says the New York appellate courts have “repeatedly” supported her claimed 
tule of law, she means . . . twice. And an examination of those two cases reveals she is quite 
wrong and, worse, has advanced a seriously misleading argument. Neither case involved, as here, 
a motion for summary judgment. In both cases, the New York appellate division affirmed the 
denial of a motion to dismiss under the state’s equivalent of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
12(b)(6). See Levy v. Smith, 18 N.Y.S.3d 438, 439 (2d Dep’t 2015); National Puerto Rican Day 


Parade, Inc. v. Casa Pubs. (“NPR”), 914 N.Y.S.2d 120, 122-23 (1 Dep’t 2010). 


>As discussed in This Reply, at 16-19, the January 2015 statement would be a strange 
“press release,” as it threatened to sue the very press to which it was “releasing” information. 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page10 of 37 


This argument, too, is frivolous. Despite plaintiff's baseless claim there is an “old” 
formulation and a “more modern” formulation of republication-liability law in New York, both 
cases she cites applied the same “old” standard used by the New York Court of Appeals in 
Geraci, by this Court in the two Egiazaryan cases, and by us in our Memorandum of Law in 
support of Ms. Maxwell’s motion for summary judgment. See Levy, 18 N.Y.S.3d at 439 (citing 
Geraci and Schoepflin); NPR, 914 N.Y.S.2d at 594-95 (citing Hoffman v. Landers, 537 N.Y.S.2d 
228, 231 (2d Dep’t 1989) (citing Schoepflin)). 

Both the courts in Levy and NPR applied the Geraci standard and the 12(b)(6) standards, 
e.g., assuming the pleaded facts were true. They concluded it was possible to infer from the 
complaints’ allegations that the defendant caused the republications. Accordingly, they denied 
the motions to dismiss. See Levy, 18 N.Y.S.2d at 439; NPR, 914 N.Y.S.2d at 123. It was 
improper for plaintiff to cite these cases without disclosing they are 12(b)(6) cases in which the 
courts applied the Geraci republication rule and inferred facts from the pleaded allegations. 


B. New York state and federal courts have rejected liability for republication 
based on “foreseeability.” 


Plaintiff cites section 576 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts for the proposition that if 
republication was foreseeable, then the defendant is the cause of any special damages from the 
republication. This argument is frivolous. As an initial matter, plaintiff has pleaded no special 
damages. See Doc.1; Doc.23 at 23; Doc.37 at 17. 

Regardless, the New York Court of Appeals in Geraci rejected the Restatement’s 
foreseeability doctrine. See 938 N.E.2d at 921-22 (noting that section 576’s foreseeability 
standard “‘is not nearly as broad as plaintiff. . . suggest[s]” and “[t]hat we did not endorse sucha 
broad [Restatement] standard of foreseeability in Karaduman is evident from our decision the 


following year in Rinaldi’) (emphasis supplied). 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page11 of 37 


While trying to distinguish this Court’s decision in Davis, plaintiff fails to disclose that 
Davis itself—decided 26 years before Geraci—also rejected plaintiff's foreseeability argument. 
The Davis plaintiffs, like plaintiff Giuffre here, also asserted republication liability, despite 
defendant’s lack of participation, on the ground “he could reasonably have foreseen that 
republication would occur.” 580 F.Supp. at 1096. This Court, relying on Karaduman, was 
unpersuaded: The New York Court of Appeals “has not applied the foreseeability standard 
suggested by plaintiffs in prior libel cases in which such a standard would have been relevant, if 
not controlling.” /d. This Court noted: The jurisdictions that have adopted a foreseeability 
standard “have refused to hold responsible a defendant with no control or influence over the 
entity that actually republished the statement.” Jd. Plaintiff's failure to disclose this Court’s 
holdings in Davis is a notable lapse in candor. 

C. Plaintiff’s purported application of the Geraci rule is misleading and wrong. 

Plaintiff eventually purports to apply the “old” standard, that is to say, the controlling law 
in the state of New York. She argues Ms. Maxwell “authorized” the January 2015 statement, 


“paid money to her publicist to convince media outlets to publish it,” “request[ed]” its 


publication, “made a deliberate decision to publish her press release,” “actively participated” in 
“the decision to publish her press release,” was “active” in “influencing the media to publish” the 
statement, and “approved of” and “pushed for” the publication of the statement. Resp. 30-31. 
These argument-manufactured facts have no record support. 

In applying the controlling law, plaintiff wittingly makes a mess of it. She disingenuously 
suggests any help Ms. Maxwell gave to help her lawyer prepare the January 2015 statement and 
her signing-off on it are the equivalent of requesting, authorizing and controlling its 


republication. That isn’t the law. The “authority” required for republication liability is the 


“actual authority . . . to decide upon or implement” the republication. 580 F.Supp. at 1095 


6 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page12 of 37 


(emphasis supplied; citing Rinaldi, 420 N.E.2d at 382). Judge Sofaer studied Rinaldi’s holding, 
and noted republication liability must be based on a “decision” by the defendant to republish and 
must focus on “real authority to influence the final product, not upon evidence of acquiescence 


or peripheral involvement in the republication process.” Id. at 1096 (emphasis supplied). 





Accordingly, Judge Sofaer held, when there is “conclusive evidence of lack of actual authority” 
this is “dispositive” of republication liability and the trial court “‘ha[s] no option but to dismiss 
the case against the [defendant].” Jd. (emphasis supplied; quoting Rinaldi, 420 N.E.2d at 382). 

There is no evidence Ms. Maxwell “paid money to her publicist to convince” the media 
to publish her statement; this is why plaintiff cites no evidence to support that assertion. See 
Resp. 30. Mr. Gow’s email containing the statement says nothing to “convince” the media to 
publish the statement. See Doc.542-6, Ex.F. There is no evidence Ms. Maxwell was “active” in 
“influencing the media to publish” it; nor is there any evidence she “pushed for” or “requested” 
its publication; this is why plaintiff cites no evidence to support these assertions. See id. 31. 

Indeed, plaintiff has zero evidence Ms. Maxwell or her agents ever did anything to urge 
or request any media to publish the statement. Mr. Gow presented the January 2015 statement 
via email to six to thirty media representatives; it was not sent to anyone else; in the email he 
told the journalists he was presenting a “quotable statement” “on behalf of’ Ms. Maxwell and 
“{njo further communication will be provided.” Doc.542-6, Ex.F. It is undisputed Ms. Maxwell 
and her agents had no control over the media that republished portions of the statement. 
Doc.542-7, 542-7, Ex.J Jf] 2-3; id., Ex.K 24. 

Plaintiff argues “a jury” should decide whether Ms. Maxwell “authorized or intended” 
the statement to be republished, or “approved of, and even participated, in” its republication. 
Resp. 30-31. All plaintiffs want to get to “a jury.” The summary-judgment question is whether 


they deserve to. Plaintiff has offered no evidence to put before a jury on the dispositive Geraci 


7 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page13 of 37 


question: whether Ms. Maxwell affirmatively authorized or requested a person or entity “over 
whom [s]he has . . . control,” 938 N.E.2d at 921. The only new argument plaintiff makes in her 


entreaty to see “a jury” is that she should be permitted to prove Ms. Maxwell’s “complicity.” As 
with her other factually bereft arguments, the complicity argument awaits plaintiff's introduction 
of facts to support it. Having failed to do so, plaintiff cannot avoid summary judgment. 

Plaintiff labors in vain to turn the Barden Declaration into “disputed issues of fact.” For 
there to be a disputed factual issue, plaintiff would need to introduce evidence disputing his 
sworn statements. She has not done so. In any event, the Barden Declaration is all but irrelevant 
to the central, dispositive republication question: whether Ms. Maxwell is liable for the media’s 
republication of her statement, where they did so without her authority or request and where she 


and her agents had “no control’”® 


over the media. On this question we cited to the Barden 
Declaration for one evidentiary fact: Messrs. Barden and Gow had no control over the media.’ 
See Doc.542-7, Ex.K J 24, cited in Memo. of Law 14.5 Plaintiff has offered no admissible 
evidence disputing this fact. 

“[T]here is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving 
party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 
249 (1986). It is one thing to argue in conclusory fashion, as plaintiff does, that “a jury” should 


decide a factual question. It is quite another to identify evidence in the Rule 56 record that raises 


a genuine question of material fact, which plaintiff does not do. Summary judgment is warranted. 


°Geraci, 938 N.E.2d at 921. 


TAs discussed in Argument LD., below, we cited more plenarily to the Barden 
Declaration in connection with a different point—the particular unfairness of subjecting 
Ms. Maxwell to liability when the media selectively quoted portions of the January 15 statement. 


5In the Memorandum, we erroneously cited to J 24 of Exhibit J; we intended to cite to 
q 24 of Exhibit K (Doc.542-1, Ex.K), which is Mr. Barden’s declaration. 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page14 of 37 


D. Subjecting Ms. Maxwell to liability for the media’s republication of excerpts 
they unilaterally selected is particularly unfair. 


It is undisputed that no one ever republished in toto the January 2015 statement and that 
various media unilaterally selected portions of the statement to republish. We said on page 14 of 
our Memorandum that the media’s “selective, partial republication of the statement is more 
problematic yet” (emphasis altered). That is to say, as improper as it is to hold a publisher of a 
statement liable for republications over which she had no control, worse is it to make her liable 
for selective, partial republications of her statement. We relied on the holding in Rand v. New 
York Times Co., 430 N.Y.S.2d 271, 275 (1" Dep’t 1980), that a publisher cannot be charged with 


a republisher’s “editing and excerpting of her statement.” Memo. of Law 14. 

Plaintiff argues that our position is “absurd on its face” because “[i]t would mean ...a 
defamer could send to the media a long attack on a victim with one irrelevant sentence and, when 
the media quite predictably cut that sentence, escape liability.” Resp. 32. This argument has two 
erroneous assumptions. One is that the “defamer” can “escape liability.” Not true. An original 
publisher remains liable for her defamation. We are concerned here with republication. The 
second wrong assumption is that the original publisher must always remain liable for any 
republication. Geraci rejects that view: Under New York law “each person who repeats the 
defamatory statement is responsible for the resulting damages.” 938 N.E.2d at 921. 

The effort by plaintiff to distinguish Rand is meritless. She argues the media’s 
republication of the January 2015 statement actually was not a republication at all, just an 
original publication. Resp. 32. That argument is “absurd on its face,” id., since there is no dispute 
Ms. Maxwell did not control the media’s decision to republish (excerpts from) the statement. 
Plaintiff next argues the media did not “edit[]” or “tak[e] . . . quote[s] out of context.” Id. 


Plaintiff could not be more wrong. As she concedes, all republications of the statement by the 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page15 of 37 


media were selective, partial republications of the statement. Any such selective, partial 
republication by definition took those excerpts “out of context.” This is so because Mr. Gow 
informed the media in his email that he was providing “a quotable statement,” Doc.542-6, Ex.F, 
not a statement “from which you, the media, are free to excerpt as you please.” 

More importantly, as Mr. Barden explained, selectively excerpting the statement 
substantially altered his message. See id., Ex.K J 20. For example, when he said in the third 
paragraph that plaintiff's claims are “obvious lies,” it followed two paragraphs in which he 
explained why it was obvious the new claims are lies. See id., Ex.K JJ 19-22. Excerpting and 
republishing only the “obvious lies” phrase—as plaintiff did in her complaint—certainly gives 
the reader a different understanding than if the media had republished the entire statement. As 
Rand held: A defendant cannot be liable for the republication of derogatory but constitutionally 
protected opinion “when the foundation upon which that opinion is based is omitted. The 
defamatory remark should be read against the background of its issuance.” 430 N.Y.S.2d at 275 
(internal quotations omitted). 

Plaintiff argues: “A jury could reasonably conclude that [Ms. Maxwell’s] statement that 
Ms. Giuffre’s claims of child sexual abuse are ‘obvious lies’ is not a rhetorical device, nor 
hyperbole, but a literal and particular affirmation that [plaintiff] lied.” Resp. 33 (emphasis 
supplied). We italicize plaintiff's rhetorical sleight of hand. As plaintiff knows, nowhere did the 
January 2015 statement specify which of plaintiff's countless allegations are “obvious lies.” 
Indeed, this is the problem with plaintiff's case: since the statement specified no particular 
allegations as obvious lies, plaintiff believes she is entitled to “prove” the truth of every 
allegation she ever has made about her alleged experience as a “sex slave.” What Mr. Barden’s 
declaration makes clear is he deliberately made no reference to any specific allegation by 


plaintiff. He had a bigger target: plaintiff's credibility. He used the statement to show plaintiff's 
10 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page16 of 37 


behavior is that of a liar, i.e., one who increasingly embellishes her story, and her allegations 
become more and more outlandish, so that by January 2015 she was claiming to have had sex 
with a well respected Harvard law professor, Alan Dershowitz. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K J 19-22. 

Contrary to plaintiff's argument, “even apparent statements of fact may assume the 
character of statements of opinion, and thus be privileged, when made in public debate . . . or 
other circumstances in which an audience may anticipate the use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or 
hyperbole.” Steinhilber v. Alphonse, 501 N.E.2d 550, 556 (N.Y. 1986) (internal quotations and 
brackets omitted). That was the case here. Plaintiff falsely—and, as Judge Marra held, 
“unnecessar[ily]”°—alleged in lurid detail that Ms. Maxwell had sexually abused her. The six to 
thirty journalists would have anticipated a “fiery” denial of the allegations. Regardless, the 
statement overall was constitutionally protected opinion grounded on facts disclosed to the 
journalists: plaintiffs increasingly outlandish and inconsistent stories, her newly embellished 
allegations, and her increasingly lurid and salacious enhancements of her earlier allegations. 

E. Mr. Barden’s declaration is perfectly proper. 

Plaintiff makes a plethora of complaints about Mr. Barden’s declarations. None has any 
merit. She objects to Mr. Barden’s declaration of his intent and purposes for preparing the 
January 2015 statement because, she says, this implicates the attorney-client privilege. That is 
untrue. His intent and purposes are by definition nor attorney-client communications and do not 


implicate such communications; they are attorney work product,'° which he is free to disclose.'!

She objects he is “non-deposed.” But Mr. Barden was the third-listed potential witness in 
our Rule 26(a)(1)(A) disclosure, served on plaintiff a year ago; the disclosure said he “has 
knowledge concerning press statements by . .. Defendant in 2011-2015 at issue in this matter.”"” 
Plaintiff was free to depose him; that she chose not to was her own tactical decision. Finally, 
plaintiff argues “there are factual disputes” regarding the declaration. But plaintiff identified no 
such factual disputes relating to the declaration. A party opposing summary judgment cannot 
create a dispute by arguing, which is all plaintiff does. See Resp. 35-38. 

F. Plaintiff effectively has confessed Arguments I.B. and I.C. of the Memorandum. 

Argument I.B. of the Memorandum contends the First Amendment bars liability for 
republication by media organizations of the January 2015 statement. See Memo. of Law 16-17. 
Argument I.C. contends that under Geraci plaintiff is barred from introducing into evidence any 
of the media organizations’ republication of the January 2015 statement. See id. at 17-18. 
Plaintiff offers no resistance to these arguments. We respectfully request that the Court consider 
these arguments confessed. See, e.g., Cowan v. City of Mount Vernon, 95 F. Supp. 3d 624, 645- 
46 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing cases). 

II. The January 2015 statement is constitutionally protected opinion. 

In deciding whether a statement is opinion the New York Constitution requires 
application of “the widely used four-part Ollman''*! formula,” Immuno AG v. Moor-Jankowski, 
567 N.E.2d 1270, 1274 (N.Y. 1991). See id. at 1274, 1277-78, 1280-82 (noting Steinhilber’s 
adoption of formula). We addressed each of the four Ollman factors. The plaintiff avoids this 


analysis, choosing merely to block-quote large portions of this Court’s Rule 12(b)(6) order. That 


"Menninger Decl. EXHIBIT NN, at 2. 
8Oliman v. Evans, 750 F.2d 970 (D.C. Cir. 1984). 


12 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page18 of 37 


is a mistake. Jnmmuno AG is the seminal case prescribing the analysis to be used in a summary- 
judgment proceeding for assessing whether under the New York Constitution a statement is 
absolutely protected as opinion. 

Instead of addressing the four factors, plaintiff simply relies on this Court’s 12(b)(6) 
order. The Court’s order does not control. In deciding the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court 
assumed the complaint’s allegations were true and drew all reasonable inferences in plaintiff's 
favor. In this proceeding, plaintiff is not entitled either to the assumption or the inferences. The 
opinion-versus-fact question will be controlled by the Rule 56 record. 

Relying on the Court’s order, plaintiff argues that the question whether the three 
allegedly defamatory sentences are opinion or fact is controlled by Davis v. Boeheim, 22 N.E.3d 
999 (N.Y. 2014), and Green v. Cosby, 138 F. Supp. 3d 114 (D. Mass. 2015). See Resp. 38. Davis 
was an appeal from a 12(b)(6) dismissal. This procedural posture was critical to its decision: 

[D]efendants argue that because a reader could interpret the statement as pure 

opinion, the statement is as a consequence, nonactionable and was properly 

dismissed [pursuant to a pre-answer motion]. However, on a motion to dismiss we 

consider whether any reading of the complaint supports the defamation claim. 

Thus, although it may well be that the challenged statements are subject to 

defendants’ interpretation, the motion to dismiss must be denied if the 

communication at issue, taking the words in their ordinary meaning and in 


context, is also susceptible to a defamatory connotation. We find this complaint to 
meet this minimum pleading requirement. 


Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1006-07 (internal quotations, brackets, ellipsis and citations omitted). 

Green was a decision on the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The case was decided under 
California and Florida defamation law. See 138 F. Supp. 3d at 124, 130, 136-37. The court made 
it clear the 12(b)(6) procedural posture was critical to its decision: “At this stage of the litigation, 
the court’s concern is whether any fact contained in or implied by an allegedly defamatory 
statement is susceptible to being proved true or false; if so capable, Defendant cannot avoid 


application of defamation law by claiming the statement expresses only opinion.” Jd. at 130. 


13 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page19 of 37 


In the case at bar, application of the four Steinhilber factors on the Rule 56 record 
compels a different conclusion. The complaint alleges three sentences in the January 2015 
statement are defamatory: in the first paragraph of the statement, plaintiff Giuffre’s allegations 
are “untrue”; in the same paragraph, the “original allegations” have been “shown to be untrue”; 
and in the third paragraph, plaintiff's “claims are obvious lies.”'* Doc.1 {[ 30. 

Factor 1: Indefiniteness and ambiguity. On the face of the complaint in a 12(b)(6) 
proceeding, the words “untrue” and “obvious lies” might be susceptible of “a specific and readily 
understood factual meaning,” Doc.37 at 9. This is especially true if it is taken out of context, e.g., 
extracted from the statement. But this approach is forbidden. See, e.g., Law Firm of Daniel P. 
Foster, P.C. v. Turner Broad. Sys., 844 F.2d 955, 959 (2d Cir. 1988). 

The first sentence—“[t]he allegations made by [plaintiff] against [Ms. Maxwell] are 
untrue”—is indefinite and ambiguous because it is wholly unclear which “allegations” are being 
referenced. The second sentence—‘{t]he original allegations . . . have been fully responded to 
and shown to be untrue”—also is indefinite and ambiguous for the same reason. Additionally, it 
is unclear what are the “original” allegations. It is unclear what is meant by “shown to be 
untrue.” What one person may believe is a fact shown to be untrue, another person may believe 
is a fact not (sufficiently) shown to be untrue. The existence of God, climate change and 


existence of widespread voter fraud in the election are examples of this. The third sentence— 


'4Ms. Maxwell testified in her deposition that she “know[s]” plaintiff is a “liar.” This 
testimony, plaintiff argues, “contradict[s]” our contention that the three allegedly defamatory 
sentences in the July 2015 statement are opinion. Resp. 39-40. Plaintiff's argument is a non- 
sequitur. Ms. Maxwell’s 2016 deposition testimony in which she disclosed all the reasons she 
believes plaintiff has uttered a plethora of false allegations is irrelevant to whether the three 
sentences in the July 2015 statement, prepared by Mr. Barden to respond to the joint-motion 
allegations, are opinions. 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page20 of 37 





“{plaintiff’s] claims are obvious lies”—also is indefinite and ambiguous. An “obvious lie” to one 
person is not an “obvious lie” to another. 

Factor 2: Capable of being characterized as true or false. On the 12(b)(6) record, the 
Court held the three statements “are capable of being proven true or false.” Doc.37 at 9. As a 
general question of law, one person’s statement that another person’s allegations are “untrue” or 
are “obvious lies” is not necessarily capable of being proved true or false—regardless of the 
subject matter of the opined “untruths” or “lies.” See Rizzuto v. Nexxus Prod. Co., 641 F. Supp. 
473, 481 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), aff'd, 810 F.2d 1161 (2d Cir. 1986); Telephone Sys. Int’l v. Cecil, No. 
02 CV 9315(GBD), 2003 WL 22232908, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2003); Memo. of Law 35 
(citing cases). As Steinhilber observed, “even apparent statements of fact may assume the 
character of statements of opinion, and thus be privileged.” 501 N.E.2d at 556. 

At least two of plaintiff's CVRA allegations cannot be proven true or false (only two 
such allegations are needed in order to render the January 15 statement an opinion). We have 
identified two such allegations in the joinder motion: that Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the 
immunity granted” to Epstein, and that she “act[ed] as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” Memo. of Law 
22. Plaintiff does not dispute this. The result is that the January 15 statement’s assertion that 
plaintiff's “allegations” and “claims” in the joint motion are “untrue” or “obvious lies” is by 
definition an opinion. It cannot be proven true or false whether Ms. Maxwell “appreciated” 
Epstein’s immunity or whether she “acted as a madame.” Indeed, it seems quite obvious that the 
joinder-motion allegations about “appreciation” and “madame” are themselves opinion. 

In the statement, Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell also says plaintiff's “original 
allegations . . . have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.” Doc.542-6, Ex.F. This 
cannot be proven true or false. The “full response” to the original allegations is a reference to the 


“Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell” issued March 9, 2011, in response to plaintiff's 
15 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page21 of 37 


allegations contained in media stories, including the Churcher articles. See Doc.542-3, Ex.C. 
Whether the 2011 statement “fully” responded to the original allegations and whether it 
“showed” the original allegations to be untrue are pure (argumentative) opinion. “[O]bvious lies” 
on its face is an opinion. The “obviousness” of a lie simply cannot be proven true or false. 

Factor 3: The full context of the statement. Three contextual facts are revealed by the 
Rule 56 record. One, the email transmitting the statement to the media-representatives—along 
with the third-person references to Ms. Maxwell—told them Ms. Maxwell did not prepare the 
statement: “Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.” Doc.542-6, 
Ex.F (emphasis supplied). It is undisputed that in fact Mr. Barden prepared the bulk of it and 
ultimately approved and adopted as his work all of it. Doc.542-7, Ex.K J 10. 

Two, Mr. Barden’s statement issued on behalf of his client would not be a traditional 
press release solely to disseminate information to the media; this is why he did not request 
Mr. Gow or any other public relations specialist to prepare or participate in preparing the 
statement. /d., Ex.K J 15. The statement was a broad-brush communique to the media about 
plaintiff and her new allegations; it was not to be a “point by point” rebuttal of each new 
allegation. Id., Ex.K J 13. The logic and approach to preparing the statement were simple: 
compare plaintiff’s prior allegations and conduct in telling her story with her current allegations 
and conduct. See generally id., Ex.K J 13. When he wrote the statement, he knew of plaintiff's 
2011 allegation that she had nor had sex with Prince Andrew and he knew of her CVRA 
allegation that she did have sex with him. Id., Ex.K J 14. Also within his knowledge was the 
story she had told Churcher before March 201 1—a story that was far /ess provocative and 
salacious than the one she included in the joinder motion. See id., Ex.K ] 5; compare Docs.542-1 
& 542-2, Exs.A & B (Churcher articles published March 2011) with Doc.542-4, Ex.D (plaintiff's 


joinder motion containing dramatically different and more lurid and salacious allegations). 


16 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page22 of 37 


Mr. Barden’s approach provides critical context to explaining how the statement builds a 
logical argument that the new allegations are false. It first notes plaintiff's “original allegations”; 
then it points out how the story changed and was embellished over time, “now” with allegations 
that plaintiff had sex with a prominent and highly respected Harvard law professor (“Each time 
the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about public figures and world 
leaders . . . .”). The argument builds up to the opinion in the third paragraph: “[Plaintiff’s] claims 
are obvious lies and should be treated as such . . . .” Doc.542-6, Ex.F. See generally id., Ex.K 
| 13-22. This third paragraph—and the threat in the fourth paragraph to sue the media for 
republication of plaintiffs falsehoods—confirms what is plain from the statement itself: it was 
not a traditional press release. 

Three, the statement was intended to respond (via denial) to the media-recipients’ 
requests for a reply to the new CVRA joinder-motion allegations. Jd. JJ 8, 10, 16. But more than 
that, it was intended to be “a shot across the bow” of the media. Jd. 17. The logical argument 
was created to (a) persuade the media-recipients that they needed to “subject plaintiff's 
allegations to inquiry and scrutiny”; (b) explain to the media-recipients how it was “obvious” 
that plaintiff “had no credibility” because of her shifting story and increasingly lurid and 
salacious allegations as time went on, many of which (e.g., the allegations of sex with Prince 


Andrew and Professor Dershowitz) on their face appear far-fetched, '> and (c) warn the media- 


'SSince the CVRA joinder motion, there has emerged a substantial amount of evidence— 
some from plaintiff's own pen—that plaintiff's allegations about having been “forced” to have 
sex with prominent individuals are falsehoods. A telling example is a series of emails between 
plaintiff and reporter Churcher when plaintiff was working on negotiating a book deal about her 
alleged experiences and Churcher was trying to help her. On May 10, 2011, plaintiff tells 
Churcher she cannot remember whom she had told Churcher she had had sex with. Churcher 
responds responds, “Don’t forget Alan Dershowitz,” which Churcher says is a “good name for 
[plaintiff's] pitch” to her literary agent. It is clear neither Churcher nor plaintiff believed plaintiff 


(footnote cont'd on next page) 
17 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page23 of 37 


recipients that they republished plaintiff's obvious falsehoods against Ms. Maxwell at their legal 
peril. See id. JJ 13, 16, 17, 20. 

As the New York Court of Appeals observed, the context of a statement often is the “key 
consideration” in fact vs. opinion cases. Davis, 22 N.E.3d at 1006. So it is here. As Davis 
suggested, the three challenged statements are “subject to [Ms. Maxwell’s] interpretation,” id. at 
1007; accord Sweeney v. Prisoners’ Legal Servs. of N.Y., 538 N.Y.S.2d 370, 371-72 (3d Dep’t 
1989). The context of the January 2015 statement makes clear that the characterization of 
plaintiffs allegations and claims as “untrue” or “obvious lies” are ultimate opinions— 
conclusions—drawn from disclosed facts. 

Factor 4: The broader setting surrounding the statement, including conventions that 
might signal to readers that the statement likely is opinion and not fact. It is undisputed that 
the January 2015 statement was sent exclusively to more than six and fewer than thirty media 
representatives, each of whom expressly had requested from Mr. Gow that he provide them with 
Ms. Maxwell’s reply to the new joint-motion allegations. Doc.542-7, Ex.K {J 8, 10. As was 
obvious from the statement, it was not a traditional press release, as such a release does not 
explain—lawyer-like—why new allegations when measured against previous allegations lack 
credibility. Nor does a traditional release threaten to sue the media to whom the release is sent. 
The media representatives upon receiving the January 2015 statement would have understood it 


was presenting an (opinionated) argument that plaintiff was not credible because of her 





had had sex with Professor Dershowitz, since (a) Churcher suggests that he would be a “good 
name” to “pitch” because of his prominence (“he [represented] Claus von Bulow and a movie 
was made about that case...title was Reversal of Fortune”), and (b) Churcher states, “We all 
suspect [Professor Dershowitz] is a pedo[phile] and tho no proof of that, you probably met him 
when he was hanging put w [Epstein].”” Menninger Decl., EXHIBIT.OO, at Giuffre004096-97 
(emphasis supplied). 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page24 of 37 


inconsistent and shifting sex abuse story and her increasingly lurid allegations against more and 
more prominent individuals. And they would have understood that these characteristics of a 
storyteller undermine her credibility and ergo the credibility of her new allegations. 

In its 12(b)(6) order the Court said the three sentences have the effect of denying 
plaintiff's story but “they also clearly constitute fact to the reader.” The ruling is affected in two 
ways by the Rule 56 record. Based on the foregoing discussion of the evidence, the three 
sentences clearly constitute (argumentative) opinions of Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell. 

Though the Court did not discuss who is “the reader,” this is important in Steinhilber 
Factor 4.” Under settled defamation-opinion law, an allegedly defamatory statement is to be 
viewed “from the perspective of the audience to whom it is addressed.” Dibella v. Hopkins, No. 
01 CIV. 11779 (DC), 2002 WL 31427362, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2002). Here, “the reader” is 
six to thirty journalists. They could not have read the July 2015 statement—or the three allegedly 
defamatory sentences—the same way it was read by these journalists’ audience, i.e., the general 
public. This is because, as plaintiff implicitly concedes, these journalists only republished 
excerpts—and not the entirety of the statement, which would have given context to the three 
sentences. It is axiomatic that an out-of-context republication of the three sentences—without the 
rest of the statement—would deprive the reader of the logic and reasoning behind the 


opinionated conclusion that plaintiff was making “untrue” allegations and telling “obvious lies.” 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page25 of 37 


Ill. The pre-litigation privilege bars this action. 

A. The privilege applies to the January 2015 statement. 

Statements pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation made by attorneys (or their 
agents under their direction!®) before the commencement of litigation are privileged and “no 
cause of action for defamation can be based on those statements,” Front, Inc. v. Khalil, 28 
N.E.3d 15, 16 (N.Y. 2015). The facts that must be established, therefore, are (a) a statement, 
(b) that is pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation, and (c) by attorneys or their agents 
under their direction. We did this. See Memo. of Law 6-8, 33-38; Doc.542-7, Ex.K {ff 8-30. For 
example, Mr. Barden (a) drafted the vast majority of the January 2015 statement and approved 
and adopted all of it, (b) directed Mr. Gow to send it to the media representatives who had 
requested Ms. Maxwell’s reply to plaintiff’s joint-motion allegations, (c) in the statement 
threatened legal action again these media representatives, and (d) at the time of the statement 
“was contemplating litigation against the press-recipients.” Jd., Ex.K Jf 10, 16-17, 28, 30. 

Plaintiff argues without citation to authority: Ms. Maxwell herself did not testify she 
intended to sue; she hasn’t offered any witnesses to testify she intended to bring a lawsuit; she 
didn’t in fact sue; and—this one is a non-sequitur—the statement was an “attempt[] to continue 
to conceal her criminal acts.” Resp. 41-42. These arguments fail. The privilege exists without 
regard to whether Ms. Maxwell testifies she “intended” to sue, whether she has “witnesses” to 
say she intended to sue, or whether she “in fact” sued. It refers to “anticipated” litigation, not 
“guaranteed” litigation. Indeed, the point of the pre-litigation privilege is to promote 
communications that avoid litigation. See Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19 (“When litigation is 

'©See Chambers v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., No. CV 15-6976 (JBS/JS), 2016 WL 


3533998, at *8 (D.N.J. June 28, 2016); see generally Hawkins v. Harris, 661 A.2d 284, 289-91 
(N.J. 1995). 


20 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page26 of 37 


anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to communicate in order to reduce or avoid the 
need to actually commence litigation.”). It applies when there is a good faith basis to anticipate 
litigation. Mr. Barden, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyer who drafted and caused the statement to be sent 
out, actually was anticipating litigation. Doc.542-7, Ex.K J 28. The argument that the statement 
was an attempt to “conceal” Ms. Maxwell’s “criminal acts” is fatuous. It would be hard to post 
facto “conceal” alleged criminal acts that plaintiff luridly and salaciously described in an earlier 
public filing, i.e., in the CVRA case, in which the United States government was the defendant. 

Citing no record evidence, plaintiff argues, “The record evidence shows [Mr. Barden] did 
not make the [January 2015] statement.” Resp. 42. That argument is easily disposed of by 
Mr. Barden’s uncontested testimony. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K J 10-13, 15-17, 20, 26-28, 30. 

B. Malice is irrelevant to the pre-litigation privilege. 

Citing the New York Court of Appeals’ decision in Khalil, we pointed out that malice is 
not relevant to the pre-litigation privilege. Memo. of Law 34-35. To prevail on the pre-litigation 
privilege the defendant need only establish one element: the allegedly defamatory statement at 


issue was “pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation.”” Jd. (quoting Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 
16). Plaintiff disputes this and, without discussing Khalil or citing authorities, simply argues the 
pre-litigation privilege is “foreclosed . . . because [Ms. Maxwell] acted with malice.” Resp. 43. 
As suggested by her inability to find any law to support her, plaintiff is wrong. 

Under general New York defamation law, “[t]he shield provided by a qualified privilege 
may be dissolved” if plaintiff in rebuttal can show that the defendant “spoke with ‘malice.’” 
Liberman v. Gelstein, 605 N.E.2d 344, 349 (N.Y. 1992); accord Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19. 


“Malice” means two things: spite or ill will, and knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of 


falsity. Liberman, 605 N.E.2d at 349. Plaintiff relies on this general qualified-privilege law.

The problem for plaintiff is that in Khalil the New York Court of Appeals held this 
general rule does not apply to the pre-litigation privilege. Khalil worked for a company named 
Front. After eight years, he resigned and began working for “EOC,” one of Front’s competitors. 
Front’s lawyer Kimmel sent a demand letter to Khalil alleging he had committed criminal, 
tortious and ethical misconduct. Kimmel sent another demand letter to EOC and others stating 
Khalil had conspired with EOC to breach his fiduciary duty to Front. Six months later, Front 
sued Khalil. Khalil brought a third-party claim against Kimmel for libel per se. The trial court 
dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the letters were “absolutely privileged” under the litigation 
privilege “and that it therefore did not need to reach the question of malice.” 28 N.E.3d at 17 
(internal quotations omitted). The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that the litigation 
privilege absolutely protected the letter “because they were issued in the context of prospective 
litigation.” Zd. at 18 (internal quotations omitted). 

The Court of Appeals affirmed, but altered the law on the litigation privilege. It observed, 
“Although it is well-settled that statements made in the course of litigation are entitled to 
absolute privilege, this Court has not directly addressed whether statements made by an attorney 
on behalf of his or her client in connection with prospective litigation are privileged.” Id. 
(emphasis supplied). Some Appellate Division departments had held the absolute privilege 
applies to statements made in connection with prospective litigation, but other departments had 
held such statements were entitled only to a qualified privilege. Id. 

The answer to whether pre-litigation statements should be absolute or qualified, the Court 
of Appeals held, is driven by the rationale for protecting pre-litigation statements: 

When litigation is anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to 

communicate in order to reduce or avoid the need to actually commence 

litigation. Attorneys often send cease and desist letters to avoid litigation. . . . 


Communication during this pre-litigation phase should be encouraged and not 
chilled by the possibility of being the basis for a defamation suit. 


22 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page28 of 37 


Id. at 19. However, the court recognized that “extending privileged status to communication 
made prior to anticipated litigation has the potential to be abused”; extending an absolute 
privilege to this context, the court said, “would be problematic and unnecessary.” Id. 

The court held it would recognize only a qualified privilege for pre-litigation 
communications. /d. Crucially to the case at bar, the court held that the traditional privilege- 
rebuttal malice was inapplicable to the pre-litigation privilege: 


Rather than applying the general malice standard to this pre-litigation stage, the 
privilege should only be applied to statements pertinent to a good faith anticipated 
litigation. This requirement ensures that privilege does not protect attorneys who 
are seeking to bully, harass, or intimidate their client’s adversaries by threatening 
baseless litigation or by asserting wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in 
law and fact, in violation of counsel’s ethical obligations. Therefore, we hold that 
statements made prior to the commencement of an anticipated litigation are 
privileged, and that the privilege is lost where a defendant proves that the 
statements were not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation. 


Id. (emphasis supplied). 

Accordingly, the only question is whether the January 2015 statement Mr. Barden caused 
to be issued to the six to thirty journalists was “pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation.” 
The undisputed evidence establishes that the answer is yes. Mr. Barden anticipated litigation.'” 
He “fully complied with [his] ethical obligation as a lawyer.”'* He was hardly “bully[ing], 


harass[ing], or intimidat[ing]” the six to thirty journalists, since he caused a press agent, Mr. 


See Doc.542-7, Ex.K J 28 (“At the time I directed the issuance of the statement, I was 
contemplating litigation against the press-recipients . . . .”); id. | 17 (statement was intended as 
“a shot across the bow’”; “the statement was very much intended as a cease and desist letter to 
the media-recipients, letting [them] understand the seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell 
considered the publication of plaintiff's obviously false allegations and the legal indefensibility 
of their own conduct”); Doc.542-6, Ex.F (“Maxwell . . . reserves her right to seek redress”).

Gow, to issue the statement,’ and he believed he had an affirmative duty in representing 
Ms. Maxwell to prepare the statement and cause it to be delivered to the journalists.”” 

Plaintiff argues that when Mr. Barden issued the January 2015 statement on 
Ms. Maxwell’s behalf, he had only “‘wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact, 
in violation of counsel’s ethical obligations’” and did not have “‘good faith anticipated 
litigation.’” Resp. 46 (quoting Khalil, 28 N.E.3d at 19; italics omitted). Plaintiff’s rationale? 
Because she was telling the truth and so the media would only be reporting the truth. Jd. That is a 
nonsensical, frivolous argument. 

Whether Mr. Barden, who represents Ms. Maxwell, had a meritorious or good faith basis 
for anticipating defamation litigation has nothing to do with whether the media believed plaintiff 
was telling the truth, and surely not whether the plaintiff believed or said she was telling the 
truth. Based on his knowledge of plaintiff's history, Mr. Barden in good faith believed that 
plaintiff had been making false allegations for years and that the falsity of the allegations “should 
have been obvious to the media.” Doc.542-7, Ex.K {| 13; see id. Jl 14, 16-17, 20-23, 26-28, 30. 
Accordingly, at the time he caused the statement to issue, Mr. Barden had a good-faith basis to 
anticipate litigation against any of the media that republished plaintiff’s false allegations. 

It hardly matters for purposes of the pre-litigation privilege whether the media 
republished or did not republish plaintiff's allegations or whether Mr. Barden ultimately did or 
did not sue any of the media for any republication. As the Khalil court recognized, “[a]ttorneys 


often send cease and desist letters to avoid litigation,” 28 N.E.3d at 19, and such letters have a 


The Khalil court admonished attorneys to “exercise caution when corresponding with 
unrepresented potential parties who may be particularly susceptible to harassment and 
unequipped to respond properly even to appropriate communications from an attorney.” Khalil, 
28 N.E.3d at 19 n.2.

valid purpose protected by the pre-litigation privilege. Mr. Barden testified that the January 2015 
statement in fact served as a cease and desist letter. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K J 17. 


IV. Ms. Maxwell’s January 4, 2015, statement is nonactionable. 


Plaintiff did not respond to our argument that Ms. Maxwell’s January 4, 2015, statement 
to a reporter is nonactionable. See Memo. of Law 38-39. We respectfully submit plaintiff has 
confessed this point. See Cowan, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 645-46. 


V. Summary judgment is warranted because plaintiff cannot establish falsity or actual 
malice by clear and convincing evidence. 


Plaintiff is a public figure. See Memo. of Law 16-17, 49-54. Therefore, she must prove 
falsity and actual malice. Under New York law, a public-figure defamation plaintiff must go 
beyond the federal constitutional minimum and prove falsity by clear and convincing evidence. 
Blair v. Inside Ed. Prods., 7 F. Supp. 3d 348, 358 & n.6 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing DiBella v. 
Hopkins, 403 F.3d 102, 111 (2d Cir.2005)). She must also prove actual malice by clear and 
convincing evidence. Karedes v. Ackerley Grp., Inc., 423 F.3d 107, 114 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting 
Phila. Newspapers v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 773 (1986)). 

Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that “produces in the mind of the trier of fact a 
firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so 
clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable the factfinder to come to a clear conviction, 
without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.” Blair, 7 F. Supp. 3d. at 358 (internal 
quotations and brackets omitted). 

Plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence (a) the material falsity of three 
sentences in the context of the January 2015 statement, and (b) Ms. Maxwell’s actual malice, i.e., 
knowledge of the falsity of the three sentences or reckless disregard of whether they were false. 


The three sentences are: in the first paragraph of the statement, plaintiff’s allegations are 


25 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page31 of 37 


“untrue”; in the same paragraph, the “original allegations” have been “shown to be untrue”; and 
in the third paragraph, plaintiff's “claims are obvious lies.””! Doc.1 {{ 30. 

Plaintiff cannot prove the falsity of the three sentences, let alone actual malice. If the 
Rule 56 record establishes that two of plaintiff's CVRA joinder-motion allegations are false and 
two of her “original” allegations are false, this defamation action collapses on itself. This is 
because the statement does not specify how many of plaintiffs allegations are false; it certainly 
does not say “all” plaintiff's allegations are false. It uses the plural of “allegation.” The plural of 
allegation literally means “more than one.” See Memo. of Law 21. 

Sentence No. 1. Since the sentence does not specify any particular allegation and since 
plaintiff made a plethora of allegations against Ms. Maxwell, plaintiff would be required to prove 
the truth of every one of the plethora of allegations and that Ms. Maxwell knew each one of the 
allegations was true. Conversely, if there are at least two allegations that plaintiff cannot prove to 
be true or if there was good reason for Ms. Maxwell to believe at least two of the allegations to 
be false, then summary judgment should enter against plaintiff. 

There are at least two allegations by plaintiff against Ms. Maxwell that are untrue. In the 
CVRA joinder motion, plaintiff alleged that in plaintiff's first encounter with Mr. Epstein, 

Ms. Maxwell took her to Mr. Epstein’s bedroom for a massage that Mr. Epstein and 
Ms. Maxwell “turned . . . into a sexual encounter,” Doc.542-4, Ex.D, at 3. This allegation 


contradicted her allegation in the Sharon Churcher article that a woman other than Ms. Maxwell 


21M. Maxwell said in her deposition she “know[s]” plaintiff is a “liar.” This testimony, 
plaintiff argues, “contradict[s]” our contention that the three sentences in the January 2015 
statement are opinion. Resp. 39-40. Plaintiff's argument is a non-sequitur. Ms. Maxwell’s 2016 
deposition testimony in which she disclosed all the reasons she believes plaintiff has uttered a 
plethora of false allegations is wholly irrelevant to whether the three sentences in the January 
2015 statement, prepared by Mr. Barden to respond to the joint-motion allegations, are opinions. 


26 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page32 of 37 


took her to Mr. Epstein’s bedroom; during the massage that woman gave instructions to plaintiff, 
and the massage “quickly developed into a sexual encounter.” Doc.542-1, Ex.A, at 4. 

A second allegation pertaining to plaintiff's entire story about Ms. Maxwell’s 
introduction of plaintiff to Prince Andrew is untrue. In the joinder motion, plaintiff alleged 
Ms. Maxwell served an “important . . . role” in “Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” namely, 
connecting Mr. Epstein to “powerful individuals” who would sexually abuse plaintiff. Jd., Ex.D, 
at 5. Plaintiff alleged that in this role Ms. Maxwell introduced plaintiff to Prince Andrew, and 
she was “forced to have sexual relations with this Prince in three separate geographical 
locations,” including Ms. Maxwell’s London apartment. Jd., Ex.D, at 5. These allegations 
directly contradicted her earlier allegations in the 2011 Churcher article that (a) there never was 
“any sexual contact between [plaintiff] and [Prince] Andrew,” and (b) Prince Andrew did not 
know “Epstein paid her to have sex with [Epstein’s] friends.” Id., Ex.A, at 6. 

Mr. Barden on behalf of Ms. Maxwell said in the first sentence that plaintiff's 
“allegations” —plural—against Ms. Maxwell are “untrue.” We have just established through 
plaintiff's own contradictory words that it would be fair to characterize at least two of her 
allegations to be untrue. Having spent significant time with Ms. Churcher in 2011 and having 
substantial incentive to disclose all important details of her “sex abuse” story, see Menninger 
Decl. EXHIBIT OO, plaintiff in 2011 presented a story that exculpated Ms. Maxwell and Prince 
Andrew of the very misconduct that in 2015—after securing a lawyer and seeing her story as a 
profit vehicle—she inculpated them for. In the face of her contradictory allegations, plaintiff 
cannot possibly prove by clear and convincing evidence that all her joinder-motion allegations 
are true, or that when Ms. Maxwell said they were untrue, she knew each one of the allegations 


was true or that she recklessly disregarded whether each one was true. 


27 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page33 of 37 


Under New York law, a defendant’s allegedly defamatory statement is held “to a standard 
of substantial, not literal, accuracy.” Law Firm of Daniel P. Foster, 844 F.2d at 959. Here, 

Ms. Maxwell’s first sentence /iterally is true: more than one of plaintiff's allegations are 
“untrue.” Accordingly, there is no defamation. 

Sentence No. 2. The second sentence at issue in this action states, “The original 
allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.” Plaintiff 
alleges the sentence is defamatory to the extent it asserts the original allegations were “shown to 
be untrue.” Doc.1 § 30. Plaintiff cannot prove this statement’s falsity. 

It is a matter of pure opinion whether any given allegation was “shown” to be untrue. 
Some people require more proof than others to conclude that a fact has been “shown to be 
untrue.” We discussed above various examples of this, e.g., climate change. Here, Ms. Maxwell 
via Mr. Barden in March 2011 issued a statement denying plaintiff's Churcher-story allegations 
as “all entirely false.” Doc.542-3, Ex.C. Plaintiff did not respond to this statement, let alone 
claim it was defamatory. Her non-response reasonably could be seen as a concession that 
Ms. Maxwell’s denial was righteous. See Doc.542-7, Ex.K (Mr. Barden: “I would have been 
remiss if I had sat back and not issued a denial, and the press had published that Ms. Maxwell 
had not responded to enquiries and had not denied the new allegations; the public might have 
taken the silence as an admission there was some truth in the in allegations.”). 

Regardless, we easily can show two of plaintiff’s original allegations are untrue. Many of 
plaintiffs original allegations are contained in the two Churcher articles, Docs.542-1 & 542-2, 
Exs.A & B. The articles contained numerous allegations by plaintiff relating to her alleged 
sexual abuse. In her deposition, plaintiff was shown Deposition Exhibit 7, a collection of some of 
her allegations in the articles. Plaintiff placed checkmarks by those allegations she admitted— 


over the course of 20 pages of testimony—were not true. See Menninger Decl. EXHIBIT PP, at 


28 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page34 of 37 


435:7-455:6 & Depo. Ex.7. These include her claims that: (1) she was 17 when she flew to the 
Caribbean with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell “went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter,” 
referring to former President Bill Clinton; (2) her conversation with Mr. Clinton about 

Ms. Maxwell’s pilot skills; and (3) Donald Trump was a “good friend” of Mr. Epstein’s and 
“flirted with me”. 

Plaintiff's admissions on the falsity of her original allegations are fatal to her defamation 
claim as to the second sentence. The eleven admittedly false “original allegations” axiomatically 
would warrant the second sentence. Plaintiff has no possible way to prove the second sentence is 
false. Indeed, like Ms. Maxwell’s first sentence, the second sentence literally is true: more than 
one of plaintiff's original allegations are untrue. A statement that literally is true cannot be 
defamatory as a matter of law. See Law Firm of Daniel P. Foster, 844 F.2d at 959. 

Sentence No. 3. Defamation as to the third sentence is foreclosed. To begin with, as 
discussed above, whether plaintiff has uttered “obvious lies” is a matter of opinion: in the face of 
plaintiff's gratuitous and lurid allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s years-long participation at the center 
of a child sex-trafficking ring, for the journalists-recipients of the July 2015 statement the phrase 
was an anticipated “epithet[], fiery rhetoric or hyperbole,” Steinhilber, 501 N.E.2d at 556 
(internal quotations omitted); see Tel. Sys. Int’l, 2003 WL 22232908, at *2 (observing Court’s 
previous holding in Rizzuto that defendants’ use of phrases “conned,” “rip off’ and “lying” in 
advertisements were not actionable as libel and were “rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet 
used by those who considered themselves unfairly treated and sought to bring what they alleged 
were the true facts to the readers”) (internal quotations omitted). 

Even if arguendo the third sentence—plaintiff’s “claims are obvious lies”—cannot be 
considered opinion, the Rule 56 record forecloses a defamation claim. The sentence does not 
Ps “ 


specify which of plaintiff’s “claims,” i.e., allegations, are obvious lies. It could refer to the 


29 


Case 18-2868, Document 279, 08/09/2019, 2628231, Page35 of 37 


“original” claims; the “new,” CVRA claims; the claims against Ms. Maxwell; the claims against 
anyone, including Professor Dershowitz, who was mentioned in the preceding sentence; or any 
two or more of all the claims plaintiff ever had made about her alleged experiences as the alleged 
victim of a child sex-trafficking ring. 

Regardless of what is being referred to, there is no defamation. As demonstrated in the 
discussion above of the first and second sentences, the Rule 56 record establishes that at least 
two of plaintiff's “original” allegations are untrue, at least two of her CVRA allegations are 
untrue, at least two of her allegations against Ms. Maxwell are untrue, at least two of her 
allegations against anyone (e.g., Ms. Maxwell, Prince Andrew or Professor Dershowitz) are 
untrue, and at least two of her allegations about her alleged sex-trafficking experiences are 
untrue. Moreover, the untruthfulness—the falsity—of the allegations certainly is “obvious.” 
After all, plaintiff herself admitted under oath that a multitude of her original allegations are 
untrue, and she implicitly admitted some of her CVRA allegations are untrue because they were 
contradicted by her original allegations. 


CONCLUSION 


The Court should grant summary judgment in favor of Ms. Maxwell.

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page9 of 74 


I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

There can be no question that disputed issues of material facts preclude granting 
summary judgment when, in a one-count defamation case, Defendant presents the Court with a 
68-page memorandum of law, a 16-page statement of purported facts, and approximately 700 
pages of exhibits. The sheer scope of Defendant’s response, if anything, conclusively 
demonstrates that volumes of disputed facts surround the core question of whether Defendant 
abused Ms. Giuffre. Indeed, Defendant acknowledges a dispute between the parties as to whether 
she abused Ms. Giuffre. See, e.g., Motion for Summary Judgment at 1; Motion to Dismiss at 1. 
This Court already said that this disputed factual question is central to this case: 

Either Plaintiff is telling the truth about her story and Defendant’s involvement, or 

defendant is telling the truth and she was not involved in the trafficking and 

ultimate abuse of Plaintiff. The answer depends on facts. Defendant’s statements 

are therefore actionable as defamation. Whether they ultimately prove to meet the 

standards of defamation (including but not limited to falsity) is a matter for the 

fact-finder. 
Order Denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss at 10. While this fact remains in dispute, 
summary judgment is foreclosed. 

But even turning to Defendant’s claims, the avalanche of aspersions she casts upon Ms. 
Giuffre and her counsel should not distract the Court from the fact that the instant motion cannot 
come within sight of meeting the standard for an award of summary judgment. The most glaring 
and emblematic example of the Defendant’s far-fetched claims appears in her attempt to move 
away from her defamatory statement by arguing that it was her attorney and not her, who issued 
the defamatory statement for the press to publish, though she is forced to admit the statement 
was made on her behalf. This is an untenable position to take at trial, and an impossible 


argument to advance at the summary judgment stage, as both the testamentary and documentary 


evidence positively refute that argument. Defendant incorrectly asks this Court to make a factual 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page10 of 74 


finding that her defamatory press release was actually a legal opinion, issued not by her, but by 
her lawyer, to the media, despite documentary evidence showing otherwise. 

Defendant also argues that she has proven the truth of her statement calling Ms. Giuffre a 
liar with respect to the statements Ms. Giuffre made about Defendant. To the contrary, 
voluminous evidence, both documentary and testimonial from numerous witnesses, corroborate 
Ms. Giuffre’s account of Defendant’s involvement in the sexual abuse and trafficking of Ms. 
Giuffre. Just to briefly highlight a few, Johanna Sjoberg, testified that Defendant recruited her 
under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for 
Epstein, and punished her when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm.' Tony Figueroa testified that 
Defendant contacted him to recruit high school-aged girls for Epstein, and also testified that 
Maxwell and Epstein participated in multiple threesomes with Virginia Giuffre. Even more 
shockingly, the butler for Defendant’s close friend witnessed, first-hand, a fifteen-year-old 
Swedish girl crying and shaking because Defendant was attempting to force her to have sex with 
Epstein and she refused. This is a fraction of the testimony that will be elicited at trial about 
Defendant’s involvement in the sexual abuse and trafficking of Ms. Giuffre. 

Defendant’s primary argument in support of her contention that she did not abuse and 
traffic Ms. Giuffre as a minor child is that employment records show that Ms. Giuffre was either 
sixteen or seventeen when Defendant recruited her from her job at Mar-a-Lago for sex with 
Epstein, not fifteen-years-old as Plaintiff originally thought. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex- 
trafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense. Defendant does not explain why sexual 
abuse of a fifteen year old differs in any material way from sexual abuse of a sixteen or 
seventeen year old. All instances involve a minor child, who cannot consent, and who is 


'See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr, at 8:5-10; 13:1-3; 12:17-14:3; 15:1-5; 32:9-16; 34:5-35:1; 
36:2-1. 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page11 of 74 


protected by federal and state laws. The fact remains that Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre while 
she was a minor child for sexual purposes and then proceeded to take her all over the world on 
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet, the “Lolita Express,”” as well as to his various 
residences, and even to her own London house. Flight logs even reveal twenty-three flights that 
Defendant shared with Ms. Giuffre — although Defendant claims she is unable to remember even 
a single one of those flights. Inconsequential details that Ms. Giuffre may have originally 
remembered incorrectly do not render her substantive claims of abuse by Defendant false, much 
less deliberate “lies.” At most, these minor inaccuracies, in the context of a child suffering from 
a troubled childhood and sexual abuse, create nothing more than a fact question on whether 
Defendant’s statement that Ms. Giuffre lied when she accused Defendant of abuse is 
“substantially true,” thereby precluding summary judgment. See Mitre Sports Int’l Ltd. v. Home 
Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 255 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (“Because determining whether COI 
is substantially true would require this court to decide disputed facts ... summary judgment is not 
appropriate”). 

Defendant has tried to spin these inconsequential mistakes of memory into talismanic 
significance and evidence of some form of bad-faith litigation, but this claim fails under the 
weight of the evidence. As the Court knows, the clear weight of the evidence establishes 
Defendant’s heavy and extensive involvement in both Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring and 
in recruiting Ms. Giuffre, living with her and Jeffrey Epstein in the same homes while Ms. 
Giuffre was a minor, and traveling with Ms. Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein — including 23 


documented flights. Even the house staff testified that Defendant and Ms. Giuffre were regularly

together. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 103:4-9 (“Q. After that day, do you 
recall that she started coming to the house more frequently. A. Yes, she did. Q. In fact, did she 
start coming to the house approximately three times a week? A. Yes, probably.”). It is also 
undisputed that witnesses deposed in this case have testified about Defendant’s role as a procurer 
of underage girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. At the very least, a trier of fact should 
determine whether the evidence establishes whether or not Ms. Giuffre’s claims of Defendant 
being involved in her trafficking and abuse are true. Defendant’s summary judgment motion 
should be denied in its entirety. 
Il. UNDISPUTED FACTS 
The record evidence in this case shows that Defendant shared a household with convicted 
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein for many years. While there, she actively took part in recruiting 
underage girls and young women for sex with Epstein, as well as scheduling the girls to come 
over, and maintaining a list of the girls and their phone numbers. Ms. Giuffre was indisputably a 
minor when Defendant recruited her to have sex with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. 
Thereafter, Ms. Giuffre flew on Epstein’s private jets — the — Lolita Express” — with Defendant at 
least 23 times. 
A. It is an Undisputed Fact That Multiple Witnesses Deposed in This Case Have 

Testified That Defendant Operated as Convicted Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s 

Procurer of Underage Girls. 

1. It is an undisputed fact that Joanna Sjoberg testified Defendant lured 


her from her school to have sex with Epstein under the guise of hiring 
her for a job answering phones. 








Ms. Sjoberg’s account of her experiences with Defendant are chillingly similar. As with 
Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, a perfect stranger, approached Ms. Sjoberg while trolling Ms. Sjoberg’s 
school grounds. She lured Ms. Sjoberg into her and Epstein’s home under the guise of a 


legitimate job of answering phones, a pretext that lasted only a day. A young college student, 


4 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page13 of 74 


nearly 2,000 miles from home, Defendant soon instructed Ms. Sjoberg to massage Epstein, and 
made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring Epstein to orgasm during these massages so 
that Defendant did not have to do it. 


Q. And when did you first meet Ms. Maxwell? 
A. 2001. March probably. End of February/beginning of March. 
Q. And how did you meet her? 
A. She approached me while I was on campus at Palm Beach Atlantic College. 

eR 
Q. And how long did you work in that position answering phones and doing -- 
A. Just that one day. 

eR 
Q. And what happened that second time you came to the house? 
A. At that point, I met Emmy Taylor, and she took me up to Jeffrey’s bathroom and he was 
present. And her and I both massaged Jeffrey. She was showing me how to massage. And 
then she -- he took -- he got off the table, she got on the table. She took off her clothes, got 
on the table, and then he was showing me moves that he liked. And then I took my clothes 
off. They asked me to get on the table so I could feel it. Then they both massaged me. 

2 
Q. Who did Emmy work for? 
2 A. Ghislaine. 
3 Q. Did Maxwell ever refer to Emmy by any particular term? 
5 A. She called her her slave. 

RE 
Q. Did Jeffrey ever tell you why he received so many massages from so many different girls? 
A. He explained to me that, in his opinion, he needed to have three orgasms a day. It was 
biological, like eating. 

eR 
Q. Was there anything you were supposed to do in order to get the camera? 
THE WITNESS: I did not know that there were expectations of me to get the camera until 
after. She [Defendant] had purchased the camera for me, and I was over there giving Jeffrey 
a massage. I did not know that she was in possession of the camera until later. She told me -- 
called me after I had left and said, I have the camera for you, but you cannot receive it yet 
because you came here and didn’t finish your job and I had to finish it for you. 
Q. And did you -- what did you understand her to mean? 
A. She was implying that I did not get Jeffrey off, and so she had to do it. 
Q. And when you say “get Jeffrey off,” do you mean bring him to orgasm? 
A. Yes. 

eR 
Q. Based on what you knew, did Maxwell know that the type of massages Jeffrey was getting 
typically involved sexual acts? 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
Q. What was Maxwell’s main job with respect to Jeffrey? 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page14 of 74 


THE WITNESS: Well, beyond companionship, her job, as it related to me, was to find 
other girls that would perform massages for him and herself. 


Ms. Sjoberg also testified about sexual acts that occurred with her, Prince Andrew, and 
Ms. Giuffre, when she and Defendant were staying at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion: 


Q. Tell me how it came to be that there was a picture taken. 

THE WITNESS: I just remember someone suggesting a photo, and they told us to go get on 
the couch. And so Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet, the puppet 
on her lap. And so then I sat on Andrew’s lap, and I believe on my own volition, and they 
took the puppet’s hands and put it on Virginia’s breast, and so Andrew put his on mine.* 


Ms. Sjoberg’s testimony corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s account of how Defendant recruited 
her (and others) under a ruse of a legitimate job in order to bring them into the household to have 
sex with Epstein. Ms. Sjoberg’s testimony also corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s account of being lent 
out to Prince Andrew by Defendant, as even the interaction Ms. Sjoberg witnessed included a 
sexual act: Prince Andrew using a puppet to touch Ms. Giuffre’s breast while using a hand to 
touch Ms. Sjoberg’s breast. 


2, It is an undisputed fact that Tony Figueroa testified that Defendant 
would call him to bring over underage girls and that Defendant and 
Epstein would have threesomes with Ms. Giuffre.” 


Tony Figueroa testified that Plaintiff told him about threesomes Ms. Giuffre had with 
Defendant and Epstein which included the use of strap-ons: 


Q. Okay. And tell me everything that you remember about what Ms. Roberts said about 
being intimate with Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein at the same time. 

A. [remember her talking about, like, strap-ons and stuff like that. But, I mean, like I said, 
all the details are not really that clear. But I remember her talking about, like, how _ they 
would always be using and stuff like that. 

Q. She and Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein would use strap-ons? 


A. Uh-huh (affirmative). 
ae

36:2-15. 

* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 82:23-83:9. 

° Defendant attempts to discredit Figueroa’s damaging testimony by repeatedly mentioning that he has been 
convicted for a drug-related offense. Unsurprisingly, in this attack, Defendant does not mention that she has a DUI 
conviction. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. at 390:13-15. (April 22, 2016).

Q. Other than sex with the Prince, is there anyone else that Jeffrey wanted Ms. Roberts to 
have sex with that she relayed to you? 
A. Mainly, like I said, just Ms. Maxwell and all the other girls. 
Q. Ms. Maxwell wanted -- Jeffrey wanted Virginia to have sex with Ms. Maxwell? 
A. And him, yeah. 
Q. And did she tell you whether she had ever done that? 
A. Yeah. She said that she did. 
Bet 
Q. And what did she describe having happened? 
A. I believe I already told you that. With the strap-ons and dildos and everything.° 


on eeee—C™SC(‘(‘!CG 
Figueroa also testified that Defendant called him to ask if he had found any other girls for 
Epstein, thereby acting as procurer of girls for Epstein: 


Q. [W]hen Ghislaine Maxwell would call you during the time that you were living with 
Virginia, she would ask you what, specifically? 
A. Just if [had found any other girls just to bring to Jeffrey. 
Q. Okay. 
A. Pretty much every time there was a conversation with any of them, it was either asking 
Virginia where she was at, or asking her to get girls, or asking me to get girls. 
eR 
Q. Okay. Well, tell me. When did Ms. Maxwell ask you to bring a girl? 
A. Never in person. It was, like, literally, like, on the phone maybe, like, once or twice. 
Q All right. Did Ms. Maxwell call you frequently? 
A.No. 
Q. All right. How many times do you think Ms. Maxwell called you, at all? 
A. I'd just say that probably a just a few, a couple of times. Maybe once or twice. 
Q. One or two -- 
A. The majority of the time it was pretty much his assistant. 
Q. How do you know Ms. Maxwell’s voice? 
A. Because she sounds British. 
Q. So someone with a British accent called you once or twice and asked for -- 
A. Well, she told me who she was. 
Q. Okay. And what did she say when she called you and asked you to bring girls?

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page16 of 74 


3. It is an undisputed fact that Rinaldo Rizzo testified that Defendant 
took the passport of a 15-year-old Swedish girl and threatened her 
when she refused to have sex with Epstein. 


Rinaldo Rizzo was the house manager for one of Defendant’s close friends, Eva Dubin. 
Mr. Rizzo testified - through tears — how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed 
Defendant bring a 15 year old Swedish girl to Dubin’s house. In distress, the 15 year old girl 
tearfully explained to him that Defendant tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through 
threats and stealing her passport: 


Q. How old was this girl? 
A. 15 years old. 

Ret 
Q. Describe for me what the girl looked like, including her demeanor and anything else you 
remember about her when she walks into the kitchen. 
A. Very attractive, beautiful young girl. Makeup, very put together, casual dress. But she 
seemed to be upset, maybe distraught, and she was shaking, and as she sat down, she sat 
down and sat in the stool exactly the way the girls that I mentioned to you sat at Jeffrey’s 
house, with no expression and with their head down. But we could tell that she was very 
nervous. 
Q. What do you mean by distraught and shaking, what do you mean by that? 
A. Shaking, I mean literally quivering. 

Bet 
Q. What did she say? 
A. She proceeds to tell my wife and I that, and this is not -- this is blurting out, not a 
conversation like I’m having a casual conversation. That quickly, I was on an island, I was 
on the island and there was Ghislaine, there was Sarah, she said they asked me for sex, I said 
no. And she is just rambling, and I’m like what, and she said -- I asked her, I said what? And 
she says yes, I was on the island, I don’t know how I got from the island to here. Last 
afternoon or in the afternoon I was on the island and now I’m here. And I said do you have a 
-- this is not making any sense to me, and I said this is nuts, do you have a passport, do you 
have a phone? And she says no, and she says Ghislaine took my passport. And I said what, 
and she says Sarah took her passport and her phone and gave it to Ghislaine Maxwell, and at 
that point she said that she was threatened. And I said threatened, she says yes, I was 
threatened by Ghislaine not to discuss this. And I’m just shocked. So the conversation, and 
she is just rambling on and on, again, like I said, how she got here, she doesn’t know how she 
got here. Again, I asked her, did you contact your parents and she says no. At that point, she 
says I’m not supposed to talk about this. I said, but I said: How did you get here. I don’t 
understand. We were totally lost for words. And she said that before she got there, she was 
threatened again by Jeffrey and Ghislaine not to talk about what I had mentioned earlier, 
about -- again, the word she used was sex. 
Q. And during this time that you’re saying she is rambling, is her demeanor continues to be 
what you described it? 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page17 of 74 


A. Yes. 

Q. Was she in fear? 

A. Yes. 

Q. You could tell? 

A. Yes. 

A. She was shaking uncontrollably.” 


4. It is an undisputed fact that Lyn Miller testified that she believed 
Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new mama”. 


Lyn Miller is Ms. Giuffre’s mother. She testified that when Ms. Giuffre started living 
with Defendant, Defendant became Ms. Giuffre’s “new momma.”!° Incredulously, Defendant 


testified that she barely remembered Ms. Giuffre.'! 


5. It is an undisputed Fact that Detective Joseph Recarey testified that 
he sought to investigate Defendant in relation to his investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein. 


Detective Recarey led the Palm Beach Police’s investigation of Epstein. He testified that 
Defendant procured girls for Epstein, and that he sought to question her in relation to his 
investigation, but could not contact her due to the interference of Epstein’s lawyer: 


Q. A cross-reference of Jeffrey Epstein’s residence revealed which affiliated names? 
A. It revealed Nadia Marcinkova, Ghislane Maxwell, Mark Epstein. Also, the cross- 
reference, any previous reports from the residence as well. 
Q. During your investigation, did you learn of any involvement that Nadia Marcinkova had 
with any of the activities you were investigating? 

cet 
Q. The other name that is on here as a cross-reference is Ghislane Maxwell. Did you speak 
with Ghislane Maxwell? 
A. I did not. 
Q. Did you ever attempt to speak with Ghislane Maxwell? 
A. I wanted to speak with everyone related to this home, including Ms. Maxwell. My contact 
was through Gus, Attorney Gus Fronstin, at the time, who initially had told me that he would 
make everyone available for an interview. And subsequent conversations later, no one was 
available for interview and everybody had an attorney, and I was not going to be able to 
speak with them. 
Q. Okay. During your investigation, what did you learn in terms of Ghislane Maxwell’s 
involvement, if any?

THE WITNESS: Ms. Maxwell, during her research, was found to be Epstein’s long-time 
friend. During the interviews, Ms. Maxwell was involved in seeking girls to perform 
massages and work at Epstein’s home.” 


6. It is an undisputed fact that Pilot David Rodgers testified that he flew 
Defendant and Ms. Giuffre at least 23 times on Epstein’s jet, the 


“Lolita Express” and that “GM” on the flight logs Stands for 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 


Notably, at Defendant’s deposition, Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. 
Giuffre, and denied that she appeared on Epstein’s pilot’s flight logs.'* However, David Rodgers, 
Epstein pilot, testified that the passenger listed on his flight logs bearing the initials - GM — was, 
in fact, Ghislaine Maxwell, and that he was the pilot on at least 23 flights in which Defendant 
flew with Plaintiff.'* The dates of those flights show that Ms. Giuffre was an underage child on 


many of them when she flew with Defendant. ° 


7. It is an undisputed fact that Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, and 
Jeffrey Epstein invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about 
Defendant trafficking girls for Jeffery Epstein. 


Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova lived with Jeffrey Epstein for many years. 
They both invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant’s participation in 
recruiting underage girls for sex with Epstein. Marcinkova testified as follows: 


Q. Did Ghislaine Maxwell work as a recruiter of young girls for Jeffrey Epstein when 
you met her? 
A. Same answer. [Invocation of Fifth Amendment] 

ke 
Q. Have you observed Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein convert what started as 
a massage with these young girls into something sexual? 
A. Same answer.'®

met her? 
A. On advice of my counsel I must invoke my Fifth and Sixth Amendment privilege . . . 

Bec 
Q. Isn’t it true that Ghislaine Maxwell would recruit underage girls for sex and sex acts with

8. It is an undisputed fact that Juan Alessi testified that Defendant was 
one of the people who procured some of the over 100 girls he 
witnessed visit Epstein, and that he had to clean Defendant’s sex toys. 











Juan Alessi was Epstein’s house manager. He testified as follows: 


Q. And over the course of that 10-year period of time while Ms. Maxwell was at the house, 
do you have an approximation as to the number of different females — females that you were 
told were massage therapists that came to house? 
A. I cannot give you a number, but I would say probably over 100 in my stay there.

Q. Did you have occasion to clean up after the massages? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Okay. And that is after both a massage for Jeffrey Epstein, as well as clean up after a 
massage that Ghislaine Maxwell may have received? 

A. Yes. 

Q. And on occasion, after -- in cleaning up after a massage of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine 
Maxwell, did you have occasion to find vibrators or sex toys that would be left out? 

A. yes, I did.” 

9. It is an undisputed fact that Defendant was unable to garner a single 
witness throughout discovery who can testify that she did not act as 
the procurer of underage girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. 

Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one — to testify that 
Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein or participate in the sex. Even one of her 
own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated in the sex. 
Another one of Defendant’s witnesses, Ms. Giuffre’s mother, named Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s 
“new mamma.” Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time with her in 
Epstein’s shared household, like Juan Alessi, Alfredo Rodriguez and Joanna Sjoberg, have 
testified that she was Epstein’s procuress. Others who lived with her — Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia 
Marcinkova, and Sarah Kellen — invoked the Fifth Amendment so as not to answer questions on 
the same. No one has testified to the contrary. 

B. Documentary Evidence also Shows that Defendant Trafficked Ms. Giuffre 

and Procured her for Sex with Convicted Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein while 


She Was Underage. 


1. The Flight Logs 


Defendant has never offered a legal explanation for what she was doing with, and why 
she was traveling with, a minor child on 21 flights while she was a child, including 6 
international flights, aboard a convicted pedophile’s private jet all over the world. Her motion for

summary judgment — as well as all previous briefing papers — are absolutely silent on those 
damning documents. 
2. The Photographs 

Throughout a mountain of briefing and, and even in her own deposition testimony, 
Defendant never offered an explanation regarding Ms. Giuffre’s photographs of her, Defendant, 
and Epstein. She never offered a legal explanation for why Prince Andrew was photographed 
with his hand around Ms. Giuffre’s bare waist while she was a minor child, while posing with 
Defendant, inside Defendant’s house in London. This particular photograph corroborates Ms. 
Giuffre’s claims, and there is no other reasonable explanation why an American child should be 
in the company of adults not her kin, in the London house owned by the girlfriend of a now- 


: 20 
convicted sex offender. 





Ms. Giuffre also produced pictures of herself taken when she was in New York with 





Defendant and Epstein, and from a trip to Europe with Defendant and Epstein:*!

warrant, including one photograph revealing the bare bottom of a girl who appears to be pre- 


pubescent (Ms. Giuffre will only submit its redacted form):”° 





3. The Victim Identification Letter 
In 2008, the United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of Florida identified 
Ms. Giuffre as a protected “victim” of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex abuse. The U.S. Attorney mailed Ms. 


Giuffre a notice of her rights as a crime victim under the CVRA.*4 
Re: Jeffrey Epstein/ ____ NOTIFICATION OF 
IDENTIFIED VICTIM 
Dear 


By virtue of this letter, the United States Attomey’s Office for the Southern District 
of Florida provides you with the following notice because you are an identified victim of a 
federal offense.

Ms. Giuffre has provided extensive medical records in this case, including medical 
records from the time when Defendant was sexually abusing and trafficking her. Ms. Giuffre 


produced records supporting her claim of being sexually abused in New York resulting in both

Defendant and Epstein taking Plaintiff to New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York while 
she was a minor.”* The dates on the hospital records show she was seventeen years old. 
5. Judith Lightfoot Psychological Records 

As the Court is aware, Defendant propounded wildly overbroad requests for production 
concerning the past eighteen years of Ms. Giuffre’s medical history. Defendant repeatedly and 
vehemently argued to the Court that it was essential to procure every page of these records ina 
fanfare of unnecessary motion practice. See, e.g., Defendant’s Motion to Compel (DE 75); 
Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions at 10 (“Ms. Maxwell has been severely prejudiced by 
Plaintiff's failure to provide the required identifying information and documents from her health 
care providers.”). Ms. Giuffre and her counsel took on the considerable burden and significant 
expense of retrieving and producing over 250 pages of medical records from over 20 providers, 
spanning two continents and nearly two decades. 

Now that those records have been collected, Defendant’s 68 page motion makes no 
reference to a single medical record produced by Ms. Giuffre, nor a single provider, nor a single 
treatment, nor or a single medication prescribed. After Defendant’s repeated motion practice 
stressing the essentiality of these records, this may surprise the Court. But not Ms. Giuffre. 
Defendant’s requests unearthed documents that are highly unfavorable to Defendant that 
corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s claims against her. 

Years before this cause of action arose, Ms. Giuffre sought counseling from a 
psychologist for the trauma she continued to experience after being abused by Defendant and 
Epstein. A 2011 psychological treatment record, written by her treating psychologist, 


unambiguously describes Defendant as Ms. Giuffre’s abuser: 


* See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 33, GIUFFRE003259-003290. 
16 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page25 of 74 


. .. [Ms. Giuffre] was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell who said she could help 

her get a job as a massage therapist . . . seemed respectable . . . was shown how to 

massage, etc., Geoff [sic] Epstein. Told to undress and perform sexual acts on 

person. Miss Maxwell promised her $200 a job.° 

Therefore, years before Defendant defamed her, Ms. Giuffre confided in her treating 
psychologist that Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein. 

6. Message Pads 

Detective Recarey, the lead investigator of the criminal investigation into Epstein and his 
associates’ sex crimes, recovered carbon copies of hand-written messages taken by various staff, 
including Defendant, at Epstein’s Palm Beach residence.2” These were collected both from trash 
pulls from the residence and during the execution of the search warrant where the pads were 
found laying out in the open in the residence.”* The search warrant was executed in 2005 and the 
message pads collected include messages recorded in 2004 and 2005. Numerous witnesses have 
described that these copies of collected messages accurately reflect those taken by various staff 
at the Palm Beach Epstein mansion between 2004 and 2005.” 

The messages raise a question of fact as to Maxwell’s involvement in the sexual abuse of 
minors and are relevant to refute Maxwell’s denial of any involvement with Epstein during 
relevant time periods, and, accordingly her denial of knowledge of certain events. 

While there were hundreds of these messages recovered during the investigation, this 
small sample demonstrates the undeniable reality that there exists a genuine issue of material fact 
with respect to Defendant’s involvement in and knowledge of the activities described by Giuffre 
which Maxwell has said we “untrue” and “obvious lies.”

17 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page26 of 74 


This sampling reveals that Maxwell, “GM,” took messages at the residence, including 
from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein. This 
demonstrates that Maxwell was at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion in 2004 and 2005, incidentally 
a time period she has denied being around the house in her deposition. See supra 
GIUFFRE001412; 001435; 001449. The messages also reveal that multiple “girls” were leaving 
messages that were being taken and memorialized and left out in the open for anyone to see. 
Certain messages also make clear that a number of these “girls” were in school. In addition to 
taking messages herself (and the staff working under her direction taking these relevant 
messages), staff employees were taking and leaving messages for Defendant. This is evidence 
that Maxwell was in the house at relevant times, including times that she has now testified under 
oath that she was not there. Other messages demonstrate Epstein and Maxwell’s friends, 
including Jean Luc Brunel, leaving messages relating to underage females. The following is a 


small sampling of such messages:

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page28 of 74 


The following are descriptions of a sampling of messages pads*” that create a genuine dispute 


of material fact: 


One message pad reflects a who is identified in the Palm Beach Police 
Report as a minor, contacting Jeffrey Epstein for “work” explaining that she does not 
have any money. The term “work” was often used by members of Jeffrey Epstein’s 
sexual trafficking ring to refer to sexual massages. (See GIUFFRE05660 (“She stated she 
was called by Sara for her to return to work for Epstein stated ‘work’ is the term 
used by Sarah to provide the massage in underwear.”). Giuffre 001462: July 5th no year 
to JE from am) ”T need work. I mean I don’t have money. Do you have some 
work for me?” 








Other message pads reflect J who was a minor, calling and leaving a message at 
the Palm Beach mansion that she has recruited another girl for Jeffrey Epstein. The 
second message demonstrates that Jeffrey Epstein required different girls to be scheduled 
every day of the week. The third shows an offer to have two minor girls come to the 
home at the same time to provide sexual massages. These type of messages indicate the 
lack of secrecy of the fact that multiple young females were visiting every day and at 
least raises a question of fact whether Maxwell was knowledgeable and involved as 
Giuffre has said, or whether Giuffre was lying and Maxwell was not at all involved or 
aware of this activity, as Defendant would attempt to have the world believe. 

Giuffre 001428 — undated Jeffrey From - “Has girl for toni ht” ;Giuffre 


001432 (pictured above)— 7/9/04 — Mr. Epstein From is available 
on Tuesday no one for tomorrow”; GIUFFRE 001433 TTT04 = Mr. Epstein from 
— “Me and can come tomorrow any time or FBalone” ; ; Giuffre — 


001452 — undated Jeffrey from “Has girl for tonight.” 


Other message pads demonstrate that there was a pattern and practice of using young 
females to recruit additional young females to provide sexual massages on a daily basis. 
Giuffre 001413 (pictured above)— JE from “N” — ‘ hasn’t confirmed 

for 11:00 yet, so she is keeping on hold in case doesn’t call back; 
Giuffre 001448 -8/20/05 JE from - confirmed _ at 4 pm. Who is 
scheduled for morning? I believe wants to work.” 







This message pad reflects that a friend of Jeffrey Epstein is sending him a sixteen year 
old Russian girl for purposes of sex. Giuffre 001563 (pictured above)- 6/1/05 For 
Jeffrey From Jean Luc “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak 
Russian. She is 2X8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your 
1st today if you call.” 


This message pad directly refutes Maxwell’s sworn testimony that she was not present 
during the year 2005 at Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion because this shows 
leaving a message for Jeffrey at the Palm Beach home that she was going to work out 


*” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 28. 


20 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page29 of 74 


with the Defendant on September 10, 2005. The police were only able to retrieve a 
fraction of these message pads during their trash pull but even in the few they recovered, 
it shows Maxwell was regularly at the Palm Beach home during the time period she 
claimed she was not. To the contrary, she was both sending and receiving messages and 
messages, like this one, reflect her presence at the mansion. Giuffre 001412 — 9/10/05 
(during the year Maxwell says she was never around) JE from — “I went to 
Sarah and made her water bottle and I went to work out with GM.” 


These message pads further corroborate that Defendant lied in her testimony and she was 
in fact in regular contact with Jeffrey Epstein during the years 2004 and 2005. For 
example, the message from “Larry” demonstrates that Defendant is at the Palm Beach

leaving messages for Maxwell at the Palm Beach house. Giuffre 001435 7/25/04 — Mr. 
Epstein from Ms. Maxwell — “tell him to call me”; Giuffre — 001449 — 8/22/05 — JE

This message pad shows that Defendant was clearly actively involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s 
life and the activities at his Palm Beach mansion. Giuffre — 001454 — undated Jeffrey

today to stay here and help train new staff with Ghislaine.” 


This message pad clearly reflects an underage female (noted by the police redaction of

she needs to “stay in school.” Giuffre 001417 (pictured above)— Jeffrey 2/28/05

This message pad reflects a message from who was under the age of eighteen at 
the time she was going over to Jeffrey Epstein’s home to provide sexual massages 
according to the Palm Beach Investigative Report. Giuffre 001421 3/4/05 to Jeffrey 
from “Tt is o.k. for to stop by and drop something?” 


These message pads reflect the pattern of underage girls (noted by the police redaction of 
the name on the message pad) calling the Palm Beach mansion to leave a message about 
sending a “female” over to provide a sexual massage. Giuffre 001423 11/08/04 To Mr.

to me and said “I love Jeffrey.” 


Law enforcement was able to confirm identities of underage victims through the use of 
the names and telephone numbers in these message pads: 


Q. The next line down is what I wanted to focus on, April 5th, 2005. This trash pull, what

There were other individuals that had called during that day. 
Q. And when you would -- when you would see females’ names and telephone numbers, 
would you take those telephone numbers and match it to -- to a person?

It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for various personal 
friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or Defendant. 
Prior to being terminated by Defendant, the Palm Beach house butler Alfredo Rodriguez printed 
a copy of this document and ultimately provided it to the FBI. This document reflects the 
numerous phone numbers of Defendant, Epstein as well as staff phone numbers. Additionally, 
and importantly, there are several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical 
designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers 
included those of underage females (with no training in massage therapy ) — including 
fF identified during the criminal investigation of 
Epstein. This document is an authentic reflection of the people who were associated with 
Epstein, Defendant, and the management of their properties, and the knowledge each had of the 
contents of the document. 
8. Sex Slave Amazon.com Book Receipt 

Detective Recarey authenticated an Amazon.com receipt that the Palm Beach Police 
collected from Jeffrey Epstein’s trash. The books he ordered are titled:

(2) SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude — Principles, Skills and Tools by Guy 
Baldwin; and

This disturbing 2005 purchase corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account of being sexually 
exploited by Defendant and Epstein — not to mention the dozens of underage girls in the Palm 
Beach Police Report. Additionally, Defendant testified that she was not with Jeffrey Epstein in 
2005 and 2006 when he was ordering books on how to use sex slaves; however, record evidence 
contradicts that testimony. 


9. Thailand Folder with Defendant’s Phone Number 





Defendant also was integral in arranging to have Virginia go to Thailand. While Epstein 
had paid for a massage therapy session in Thailand, there was a catch. Defendant told Virginia 
she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring her back to the U.S. for Epstein and 
Defendant. Indeed, on the travel records and tickets Defendant gave to Virginia, Defendant wrote 
on the back the name of the girl Virginia was supposed to meet, and she was also instructed to 
check in frequently with Defendant as it was further signified by the words “Call Ms. Maxwell 
O) i”: on Virginia’s travel documents. In this case, Virginia also produced the hard 
copy records from her hotel stay in Thailand paid for by Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit

10. It is undisputed fact that the FBI report and the Churcher emails 
reference Ms. Giuffre’s accounts of sexual activity with Prince 
Andrew that she made in 2011, contrary to Defendant’s argument 
that Ms. Giuffre never made such claims until 2014.

See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 34, GIUFFRE003678. Accordingly, there is documentary 
evidence that refutes Defendant’s meritless argument that Ms. Giuffre did not allege she had sex 
with Prince Andrew until 2014. To the contrary, two sources, including the FBI, show Ms. 
Giuffre made these claims in 2011. 


Cc. Defendant Has Produced No Documents Whatsoever That Tend to Show 
That She Did Not Procure Underage Girls For Jeffrey Epstein. 


Defendant has produced no documents that even tend to show that she did not procure 
underage girls for sex with Epstein, and no documents that tend to show that she did not 
participate in the abuse. Indeed, Defendant refused to produce any documents dated prior to 
2009, which includes the 2000-2002 period during which she abused Ms. Giuffre. 

Against this backdrop of an avalanche of evidence showing the Defendant sexually 
trafficked Ms. Giuffre, summary judgment on any of the issues advanced by Defen dant is 
inappropriate. While we discuss the particulars of the individual claims below, the larger picture 
is important too. Ms. Giuffre will prove at trial that Epstein and Defendant sexually trafficked 
her. And yet, when Ms. Giuffre had the courage to come forward and expose what Defendant 
had done to world — in a Court pleading trying to hold Epstein accountable — Defendant 


26 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page35 of 74 


responded by calling her a liar in a press release intended for worldwide publication. Such 
heinous conduct is not a mere “opinion,” but rather is defamation executed deliberately and with 
actual malice. The jury should hear all of the evidence and then render its verdict on Ms. 
Giuffre’s complaint. 
Ill. LEGAL STANDARD 

Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a motion for summary 
judgment may be granted only when “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that 
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” The Second Circuit has repeatedly 
held that “all ambiguities and inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts should be 
resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine 
issue for trial should be resolved against the moving party.” Swan Brewery Co. Ltd. v. U.S. Trust 
Co. of New York, 832 F. Supp. 714, 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (Sweet, J.), citing Brady v. Town of 
Colchester, 863 F.2d 205, 210 (2d Cir. 1988) (internal quotations omitted). In other words, in 
deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must construe the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in the non-moving party’s 
favor. In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 517 F.3d 76, 87 (2d Cir. 2008). Stern v. Cosby, 
645 F. Supp. 2d 258, 269 (S.D.N.Y.2009). Summary judgment should be denied “if the evidence 
is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict” in favor of the non-moving party. See Net 
Jets Aviation, Inc. v. LHC Commc’ns, LLC, 537 F.3d 168, 178-79 (2d Cir. 2008). 
IV. LEGAL ARGUMENT 


A. Defendant is Liable for the Publication of the Defamatory Statement and 
Damages for Its Publication 


Defendant’s lead argument is that, when she issued a press release attacking Ms. Giuffre 


to members of the media, she somehow is not responsible when the media quickly published her 


27 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page36 of 74 


attacks. If accepted, this remarkable claim would eviscerate defamation law, as it would permit a 
defamer to send defamatory statements to the media and then stand back and watch — immune 
from liability — when (as in this case) the defamatory statements are published around the world. 
This absurd position is not the law, particularly given that the Defendant released a statement to 
media asking them to “[p]lease find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.” 

To make her claim seem plausible, Defendant cites older cases, some dating back as far 
as 1906. This presents a distorted picture of the case law on these issues. As a leading authority 
on defamation explains with regard to liability for republication by another of statement by a 
defendant: “Two standards have evolved. The older one is that the person making the defamatory 
statement is liable for republication only if it occurs with his or her express or implied 
authorization of consent. The more modern formulation adds responsibility for all republication 
that can reasonably be anticipated or that is the ‘natural and probable consequence’ of the 
publication.” SACK ON DEFAMATION § 2.7.2 at 2-113 to 2-114 (4th ed. 2016). In this case, 
however, the nuances of the applicable legal standards make little difference because Defendant 
so clearly authorized — indeed, desired and did everything possible to obtain — publication of her 
defamatory statements attacking Ms. Giuffre. 


1. Under New York Law, Defendant is liable for the media’s publication 
of her press release. 





Given the obvious purposes of defamation law, New York law unsurprisingly assigns 
liability to individuals for the media’s publication of press releases. Indeed, New York appellate 
courts have repeatedly held that an individual is liable for the media publishing that individual’s 
defamatory press release. See Levy v. Smith, 18 N.Y.S.3d 438, 439, 132 A.D.3sd 961, 962-63 
(N.Y.A.D. 2 Dept. 2015) (Generally, [o]ne who makes a defamatory statement is not 


responsible for its recommunication without his authority or request by another over whom he 


28 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page37 of 74 


has no control . . . Here, however . . . the appellant intended and authorized the republication of 
the allegedly defamatory content of the press releases in the news articles”); National Puerto 
Rican Day Parade, Inc. v. Casa Publications, Inc., 914 N.Y.S.2d 120, 123, 79 A.D.3d 592, 595 
(N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept. 2010) (affirming the refusal to dismiss defamation counts against a defendant 
who “submitted an open letter that was published in [a] newspaper, and that [the defendant] paid 
to have the open letter published,” and finding that the defendant “authorized [the newspaper] to 
recommunicate his statements.”) See also RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 576 (1977) (“The 
publication of a libel or slander is a legal cause of any special harm resulting from its repetition 
by a third person if. . . the repetition was authorized or intended by the original defamer, or . . . 
the repetition was reasonably to be expected.”)** 

Defendant deliberately sent her defamatory statement to major news media publishers for 
worldwide circulation because Defendant wanted the public at large to believe that Ms. Giuffre 
was lying about her abuse. Defendant even hired a public relations media specialist to ensure the 
media would publish her statement. Her efforts succeeded: her public relations agent instructed 
dozens of media outlets to publish her “quotable” defamatory statement and they did. 

Despite this deliberate campaign to widely publicize her defamatory statement, 
Defendant now disclaims any responsibility for the media publishing her press release. If we 
understand Defendant’s position correctly, because she somehow lacked “control” over what 
major newspapers and other media finally put in their stories, she escapes liability for 
defamation. This nonsensical position would let a defamer send a false and defamatory letter to 


major media, and then, when they published the accusation, escape any liability. Such an 


MCf, Eliah v. Ucatan Corp., 433 F. Supp. 309, 312-13 (W.D.N.Y. 1977) (“The alleged multistate publication of 
plaintiff's photograph without her consent thus gives rise to a single cause of action. ... However, evidence of the 
multistate publication of the magazine and the number of copies sold would be competent and pertinent to a 
showing of damages, if any, suffered by plaintiff.”) 





29 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page38 of 74 


argument is not only an affront to logic, but it is contrary to prevailing New York case law, cited 
above. Perhaps even more important, in the context of the pending summary judgment motion, it 
would require Defendant to convince the jury that she did not “authorize or intend” for the major 
media to publish her press release. Obviously the disputed facts on this point are legion, and 
summary judgment is accordingly inappropriate. 
Even the cases Defendant cites contradict her argument. She first cites Geraci v. Probst, 

in which a defendant sent a letter to the Board of Fire Commissioners, and, years later, a 
newspaper published the letter. The court held that the defendant was not liable for that belated 
publication, “made years later without his knowledge or participation.” /d., at 340. By contrast, 
Defendant not only authorized the defamatory statement, but paid money to her publicist to 
convince media outlets to publish it promptly — actions taken with both her knowledge and 
consent. Defendant’s statement was thus not published “without [her] authority or request,” as in 
Geraci, but by her express authority and by her express request. Defendant’s publicist’s 
testimony and the documents produced by Defendant’s publicist unambiguously establish that 
the media published her press release with Defendant’s authority and by her request: 

Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell’s retention of your 


services? 
A. Yes, I was 
ae 

Q. The subject line does have “FW” which to me indicates it’s a forward. Do you know 
where the rest of this email chain is? 
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not 
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by Ms. 
Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action. I 
therefore respond, “Okay, Ghislaine, I'll go with this.” 

It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the second 
one is “Urgent, this is the statement” so J take that as an instruction to send it out, as a 
positive command: “This is the statement.”*° 


* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 44:6-45:13 (emphasis added). 
30 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page39 of 74 


Similarly, another case cited by Defendant, Davis v. Costa-Gavras, involved a libel claim 
against a book author who wrote an account of the 1972 military coup in Chile. Years later, the 
plaintiff attempted to ascribe defamation liability to a third-party publishing house’s decision to 
republish the book in paperback form and a third-party filmmaker who released a movie based 
on the book. The Court held that a “party who is ‘innocent of all complicity’ in the publication of 
a libel cannot be held accountable . . . [but that] a deliberate decision to republish or active 
participation in implementing the republication resurrects the liability.” 580 F. Supp. 1082, 1094 
(S.D.N.Y. 1984). Here, Defendant made a deliberate decision to publish her press release, and 
actively participated in that process. At the very least, the jury must make a determination of 
whether Defendant was “innocent of all complicity” for a libelous statement contained in her 
press release. 

Finally, Defendant cites Karaduman v. Newsday, Inc., 416 N.E.2d 557 (1980), which 
held that reporters of a series of articles on narcotics trade “cannot be held personally liable for 
injuries arising from its subsequent republication in book form absent a showing that they 
approved or participated in some other manner in the activities of the third-party republisher.” 
Id., 416 N.E.2d at 559-560. Again, the jury could reasonably find that Defendant both approved 
of, and even participated in, the media’s publication of her press release. Indeed, it is hard to 
understand how any jury could find anything else. Defendant was obviously “active” in 
influencing the media to publish her defamatory press release, she both “approved” of and 


pushed for the publication of the press release. Accordingly, she is liable for its publication.*° 


*° On page 14 of her motion, Defendant makes wholly contradictory statements. In back-to-back sentences, she tells 
the Court that (1) she has no control over whether the media published the statement she sent to the media (with 
instructions to publish it by an influential publicist); (2) her public relations representative gave instructions to the 
media on how to publish it (in full); and (3) her public relations representative “made no effort to control” how the 
media would publish it. Indeed, the best evidence of Defendant’s control over the press is the fact dozens of media 
outlets obeyed her directive to publish her defamatory statement. 


31 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page40 of 74 


Therefore, disclaiming responsibility for the media’s publication of a statement (for which she 
hired a publicist for the purpose of influencing the media to publish that statement) is contrary to 


both prevailing case law, and the cases cited by Defendant. 


2. Defendant is liable for the media’s publication of the defamatory 
statement. 


After arguing, contrary to New York law, that she is not liable for the media’s publication 
of her own press release, Defendant next argues that she is not liable for the media’s publications 
of the defamatory statement contained within her press release if the media chose to make even 
the tiniest of editorial changes. If we understand Defendant’s argument correctly, any omission 
of any language from a press release is somehow a “selective, partial” publication for which she 
escapes liability. Mot. at 14. Once again, this claim is absurd on its face. It would mean that a 
defamer could send to the media a long attack on a victim with one irrelevant sentence and, when 
the media quite predictably cut that sentence, escape liability for the attack. Moreover, even on 
its face, the claim presents a jury question of what changes would be, in context, viewed as 
“selective” or “partial” publications — something that only a jury could determine after hearing 
all of the evidence. 

In support of this meritless argument, Defendant cites Rand v. New York Times Co., for 


the proposition that a defendant cannot be liable for a publisher’s “editing and excerpting of her 
statement.” 430 N.Y.S.2d 271, 274, 75 A.D.2d 417, 422 (N.Y.A.D. 1980). This argument fails 
for several reasons. First, there is no “republication” by the media as a matter of law. Defendant 
issued a defamatory statement to the press, and its publication (as Defendant intended) is not a 
“republication” under the law, as discussed above. Second, there was no “editing” or 


paraphrasing or taking the quote out of context of the core defamatory statement in the press 


release: that Ms. Giuffre is a liar. The “obvious lies” passage is the heart of the message 


32 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page41 of 74 


Defendant sent to the press: that Ms. Giuffre was lying about her past sexual abuse. Even in 
isolation, Defendant’s quote stating that Ms. Giuffre’s claims are “obvious lies” does not distort 
or misrepresent the message Defendant intended to convey to the public that Ms. Giuffre was 
lying about her claims. As this Court explained in denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, this 
case “involves statements that explicitly claim the sexual assault allegations are false.” Giuffire v. 
Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). 

Furthermore, the facts at issue here make the Rand holding inapposite. In Rand, a 
newspaper paraphrased and “sanitized” defendant’s words. No such changing, sanitizing, or 
paraphrasing occurred in the instant case: the media quoted Defendant’s statement accurately. 
Further, the phrase at issue in Rand was that certain people “screwed” another person. The 
speaker/newspaper used the term “screwed” in reference to a record label’s dealings with a 
performing artist, and not did not mean “screwed” in the literal sense, but as “rhetorical 
hyperbole, and as such, is not to be taken literally.” Jd. By contrast, there is no hyperbole in 
Defendant’s defamatory statement, and it was never distorted or paraphrased by any publication 
known to Ms. Giuffre. A jury could reasonable conclude that Defendant’s statement that Ms. 
Giuffre’s claims of child sexual abuse are “obvious lies” is not a rhetorical device, nor 
hyperbole, but a literal and particular affirmation that Ms. Giuffre lied. 

Accordingly, there is no support in the factual record that the media reporting that 
Defendant stated that Ms. Giuffre’s claims of childhood sexual abuse are “obvious lies” is a 
distortion of Defendant’s message or hyperbole. Even a cursory review of the press release 
would lead to that conclusion. Moreover, to the extent that there is any dispute that Defendant’s 


statement had a different meaning outside of the context of the remainder of the press release, 


33 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page42 of 74 


such a determination of meaning and interpretation is a question of fact for the jury to decide, 
and is inappropriate for a determination upon summary judgment. 


B. Material Issues of Fact Preclude Summary Judgment. 


1. The Barden Declaration presents disputed issues of fact. 


The primary basis of Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is her attorney’s self- 
serving, post hoc affidavit wherein he sets forth his alleged “intent” with regard Defendant’s 
defamatory statement.*” Ms. Giuffre disputes Defendant’s attorney’s alleged and unproven 
“intent” (not to mention Defendant’s “intent”), not only because Defendant refuses to turn over 
her attorney’s communications, but also because questions of intent are questions of fact to be 
determined by a trier of fact. Furthermore, ample record evidence contradicts the claimed 
“intent.” 


a. The Barden Declaration is a deceptive back-door attempt to inject 
Barden’s advice without providing discovery of all attorney 
communications. 


In her brief, Defendant discloses her attorney’s alleged legal strategy and alleged legal 
advice; however, she deliberately states that her attorney “intended,” instead of her attorney

times,** and using phrases such as Barden’s “beliefs, purposes, ‘goals,””” and 


>” The Barden declaration is problematic for other reasons as well. In addition to Defendant’s over-length, 68-page 
motion and among Defendant’s 654 pages of exhibits lies an eight-page attorney affidavit that proffers legal 
conclusions and arguments. This exhibit is yet another improper attempt to circumvent this Court’s rules on page 
limits. See Pacenza v. IBM Corp., 363 F. App'x 128, 130 (2d Cir. 2010) (affirming lower court decision to strike 
“documents submitted . . . in support of his summary judgment motion [that] included legal conclusions and 
arguments” because those “extraneous arguments constituted an attempt . . . to circumvent page-limit requirements 
submitted to the court.”); cf, HB v. Monroe Woodbury Cent. School Dist., 2012 WL 4477552, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 
27, 2012) (“The device of incorporating an affirmation into a brief by reference, as Plaintiffs have done here, in 
order to evade the twenty-five page limit, rather obviously defeats the purpose of the rule”). The court should 
disregard the Barden Declaration for that reason alone

“contemplations” 25 other times. All the while Defendant has claimed a privilege as to her 
communications with Barden. Defendant attempts to convince the Court that she only granted 
Gow permission to publish the defamatory statement as part of “Mr. Barden’s deliberated and 
carefully crafted” (MSJ at 16) legal strategy and advice. Yet, she still refused to turn over her 
communications with Barden under the auspices of attorney-client privilege.” Such 
gamesmanship should not be permitted. 

If the Court were to consider the Barden Declaration (which it shouldn’t), it would be 
ruling on a less than complete record because, based on this Declaration, it is necessary that 
Defendant disclose all communications with him and possibly others. Ms. Giuffre doesn’t have 
those communications, the court doesn’t have those communications; therefore, Defendant is 
asking for summary judgment on an incomplete record. 

The Court should also not consider the Barden Declaration because it will be 
inadmissible as unduly prejudicial. It is a self-serving declaration by a non-deposed witness 
made without turning over the documents that are relevant to the declaration. See, e.g., Rubens v. 
Mason, 387 F.3d 183, 185 (2d Cir. 2004) (“We find that the District Court predicated its grant of 
summary judgment as to liability on an affidavit from the arbitrator who presided over the 
underlying arbitration, the probative value of which was substantially outweighed by the danger 
of unfair prejudice. The affidavit, therefore should not have been admitted. We therefore vacate 
the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on liability and remand to the District Court.”). 


b. Defendant’s summary judgment argument requires factual findings 
regarding Barden’s intent, thereby precluding summary judgment. 








Even were the Court to consider this Declaration and representations therein — which it 


should not — the declaration itself demonstrates that the Court would have to make factual

finding as to what Mr. Barden’s intent really was. Finding about intent are inappropriate at the 
summary judgment stage, as this Court and the Second Circuit have recognized. This Court has 
explained, “if it is necessary to resolve inferences regarding intent, summary judgment is not 
appropriate.” Id. (Sweet, J.) (emphasis added), citing Patrick v. Le Fevre, 745 F.2d 153, 159 (2d 
Cir. 1984); Friedman v. Meyers, 482 F.2d 435, 439 (2d Cir. 1973) (other citations omitted). 


G. There are factual disputes regarding Barden’s Declaration. 





Finally, there are material disputes over the statements in the Barden Declaration because 
they are directly refuted by record evidence. For example, the instant motion and the Barden 
Declaration describe the press release merely as a document expressing “his [Mr. Bardent’s] 
opinion — in the form of a legal argument —as a lawyer would be,” as opposed to a press release 
for dissemination by the media to the public. Record evidence refutes this claim, as (1) the press 
release was sent to journalists, not media publishers or in-house counsel; (2) the press release 
instructed the journalists to publish the defamatory statement (“Please find attached a quotable 
statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell”); (3) it was issued by a publicist on Defendant’s behalf and 
not by an attorney, without any reference to attorneys or laws — indeed, Gow testified that 
Barden was unavailable to approve the statement; and (4) Gow testified that he issued the 
statement only after he understood Defendant to have “signed off” it, an understanding he 
formed based on Defendant's “positive command” to him: “This is the agreed statement.” 

Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell’s retention of your 


services? 
A. Yes, I was. 

eR 
Q. When you say “agreed statement” can you tell me more about what you mean? Who 
agreed to the statement? 
A. Ineed to give you some context, if I may, about that statement. So, this is on New Year’s 
Day. I was in France so the email time here of 21:46, in French time was 22:46, and I was 
getting up early the next morning to drive my family back from the south of France to 
England, which is a 14-hour journey, door to door. So on the morning of th® 2nd of January, 


36 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page45 of 74 


bearing in mind that Ms. Maxwell, I think was in New York then, she was five hours behind, 
so there was quite a lot of, sort of time difference between the various countries here, I sent 
her an email, I believe, saying - parsing this-- forwarding this email to her saying “How do 
you wish to proceed?” And then I was on the telephone-- I had two telephones in the car, I 
received in excess of 30 phone calls from various media outlets on th° 2nd of January, all 
asking for information about how Ms. Maxwell was looking to respond to the latest court 
filings, which were filed on the 30th of December as I understand. 
And by close-- towards close of play on the 2nd, I received an email forwarded by 
Ms. Maxwell, containing a draft statement which my understanding was the majority of 
which had been drafted by Mr. Barden with a header along the lines of “This is the agreed 
statement.”: At close of play on th® 2nd. So—I was—I had gone under the Channel Tunnel and 
I was sitting on the other side and that email, which my understanding was that it had been 
signed off by the client, effectively, was then sent out to a number of media, including Mr. 
Ball and various other UK newspapers. 
Q. Mr. Gow, when you say “end of play” and “close of play,” are you referring to sending 
the email that is Exhibit 2? 
A. Yes, lam 
ae 

Q. The subject line does have “FW” which to me indicates it’s a forward. Do you know 
where the rest of this email chain is? 
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not 
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by Ms. 
Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action. 
I therefore respond, “Okay, Ghislaine, I’ll go with this.” 

It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the 
second one is “Urgent, this is the statement” so I take that as an instruction to send it 
out, as a positive command: “This is the statement.”* 


Accordingly, record evidence shows that the press release was intended as press release, 
and not as a “legal argument.” Record evidence also establishes that Defendant circulated the 
press release to Barden and Gow, and then gave a “positive command” to Gow to publish it. 
Additionally, there is no indicia that the press release is a legal opinion. To the contrary, it was 
issued by, and specifically attributed to, a woman who has personal knowledge of whether Ms. 
Giuffre’s claims of sexual abuse are true, and she states that Ms. Giuffre is a liar.“ At the very 


least, all of these factual issues must be considered by a jury. 


® See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 31:19-33:7; 44:6-45:13 (emphasis added). 
Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites no case law to support her argument that her attorney’s alleged influence in 
preparing the statement Defendant issued to the media somehow shields her from liability. 


37 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page46 of 74 


Another example is that Defendant states that “Gow served only as Mr. Barden’s conduit 
to the media” (MTD at 25), and “Mr. Barden was directing the January 2-15 statement to a 
discrete number of media representatives.” Barden wasn’t directing anything — he wasn’t even in 
the loop when Defendant decided to publish the statement - and the documents prove it. Indeed, 
the press release itself states that it is “on behalf of Ms. Maxwell,” not Barden, and it was 
Defendant who gave the “positive command” to Gow to publish it. These are just a couple of 
examples, among many, of the purported facts asserted in Defendant’s motion and Barden’s 
Declaration that are directly refuted by facts in the record. 

Finally, neither the media nor the general public could have known that the statement 
should be attributed to Barden. His name was nowhere in it, nor is there any reference to counsel. 
Defendant’s argument that the “context” is the media knowing Barden’s intent or involvement is 
unsupported by the record. The significant factual disputes about Barden, alone, prevent 
summary judgment. 

Cc. Defendant’s Defamatory Statement Was Not Opinion as a Matter of Law. 

As this Court previously held, correctly, Defendant stating that Ms. Giuffre’s claims of 
sexual assault are lies is not an expression of opinion: 

“First, statements that Giuffre’s claims ‘against [Defendant] are untrue,’ have 

been ‘shown to be untrue,’ and are ‘obvious lies’ have a specific and readily 

understood factual meaning: that Giuffre is not telling the truth about her history 

of sexual abuse and Defendant’s role, and that some verifiable investigation has 

occurred and come to a definitive conclusion proving that fact. Second, these 

statements (as they themselves allege), are capable of being proven true or false, 

and therefore constitute actionable fact and not opinion. Third, in their full 

context, while Defendant’s statements have the effect of generally denying 

Plaintiff's story, they also clearly constitute fact to the reader.” 


Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). This Court further explained: 


“Plaintiff cannot be making claims shown to be untrue that are obvious lies 
without being a liar. Furthermore, to suggest an individual is not telling the truth 


38 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page47 of 74 


about her history of having been sexually assaulted as a minor constitutes more 

than a general denial, it alleges something deeply disturbing about the character of 

an individual willing to be publicly dishonest about such a reprehensible crime. 

Defendant’s statements clearly imply that the denials are based on facts separate 

and contradictory to those that Plaintiff has alleged.” Jd. 

Defendant argues that somehow the “context” of the entire statement “tested against the 
understanding of the average reader” should be the press release as a whole being read only by 
journalists. This is an unreasonable construct because the ultimate audience for a press release is 
the public. Indeed, the purpose of a press release is to reach readers. Unsurprisingly, Defendant 
cites no case that holds that journalists might somehow believe statements of fact are opinion 
while others do not. 

This Court has previously covered this ground when it clearly stated: 

Sexual assault of a minor is a clear-cut issue; either transgression occurred or it 

did not. Either Maxwell was involved or she was not. The issue is not a matter of 

opinion, and there cannot be differing understandings of the same facts that justify 

diametrically opposed opinion as to whether Defendant was involved in Plaintiffs 
abuse as Plaintiff has claimed. Either Plaintiff is telling the truth about her story 

and Defendant’s involvement, or Defendant is telling the truth and she was not 

involved in the trafficking and ultimate abuse of Plaintiff. 

Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp.at 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). The same conclusion applies now. At 
the motion to dismiss stage, Defendant had not yet produced the statement she issued to the 
press. That statement is now in evidence, so there is no ambiguity as to what defendant released 
to the press. 

The absurdity of Defendant characterizing his statements calling Ms. Giuffre a liar as 
mere “opinion” is revealed by the fact that Defendant was the one who was sexually trafficking 
and otherwise abusing Ms. Giuffre. No reasonable person in any context would construe that as 


Defendant’s mere “opinion” on the subject, since Defendant knew she was abusing Ms. Giuffre. 


Indeed, this argument is contradicted by Defendant’s own deposition testimony: 


39 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page48 of 74 


Q. Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors? 
A. I can only testify to what I know. I know that Virginia is a liar and I know what 
she testified is a lie. So I can only testify to what I know to be a falsehood and half 
those falsehoods are enormous and so I can only categorically deny everything she 
has said and that is the only thing I can talk about because I have no knowledge of 
anything else. 
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. (April 17, 2016) at 174:6-19. 
Defendant slyly contends in her motion that “Mr. Barden’s “arguments” in the press release 


constitute ‘pure opinion,” attempting to disclaim any involvement in making the defamatory 
statement. However, it is not Mr. Barden’s statement, nor his opinion, that it at issue here. At 
issue here is Defendant’s statement — a statement attributable to her, that she approved, whose 
publication she “command{ed],” and for which she hired a public relations representative to 
disseminate to at least 30 journalists for publication. While Mr. Barden could possibly have had 
his own opinion as to whether or not his client abused Ms. Giuffre, Defendant cannot express an 
opinion on a binary, yes/no subject where she knows the truth. As this Court previously 
articulated, “statements that Giuffre’s claims ‘against [defendant] are untrue,’ have been ‘shown 
to be untrue,’ and are ‘obvious lies’ have a specific and readily understood factual meaning.” 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp. 3d at 152. Again, at the very least, the jury must pass on such 
issues. 


D. The Pre-Litigation Privilege Does Not Apply to Defendant’s Press Release 


1. Defendant fails to make a showing that the pre-litigation privilege 
applies. 


Defendant’s next argument seeks refuge in the pre-litigation privilege. If we understand the 
argument correctly, Defendant seems to be saying that because she was contemplating an 
(unspecified and never-filed) lawsuit involving the British Press, she somehow had a “green 


light” to make whatever defamatory statements she wanted about Ms. Giuffre. To prove such a 


40 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page49 of 74 


remarkably claim, Defendant relies on caselaw involving such mundane topics as “cease and 
desist” letters sent to opposing parties and the like. Obviously such arguments have no 
application to the press release that Defendant sent out, worldwide, attacking Ms. Giuffre’s 
veracity. 

The problems with the Defendant’s argument are legion. For starters, there is no record 
evidence — not even Defendant’s own testimony — suggesting that she was contemplating 
litigation against Ms. Giuffre, or that her press release was related to contemplated litigation 
against Ms. Giuffre. Tellingly, the only “evidence” Defendant cites of any alleged contemplated 
litigation is the self-serving, post hoc, partial waiver of attorney-client privilege found in the 
Barden Declaration. As discussed above, that Declaration fails to establish that there was good 
faith anticipated litigation between her and Ms. Giuffre, particularly when evidence in the record 
contradicts such assertions. At the very least, it is a matter of fact for the jury to decide. 

In another case in which a defendant attempted to claim pre-litigation privilege applied to 
statements made to the press, this Court denied summary judgment, and held, “[t]o prevail on a 
qualified privilege defense [defendant] must show that his claim of privilege does not raise 
triable issues of fact that would defeat it.” Block v. First Blood Associates, 691 F. Supp. 685, 
699-700 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (denying summary judgment on the pre-litigation qualified 
privilege affirmative defense because there was “a genuine issue as to malice and appropriate 
purpose”). Defendant’s claim here likewise fails. 

First, Defendant’s testimony makes no mention of any contemplated lawsuit — much less, 
any contemplated lawsuit against Ms. Giuffre. Second, Defendant has offered no witnesses who 
will testify that she intended to bring any law suit. Third, she did not, in fact, bring any such 


lawsuit. The only “evidence” is a post hoc Declaration written by her attorney. Finally, it must be 


41 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page5S0O of 74 


remembered, as explained at length above, the Defendant had sexually trafficking Defendant and 
was attempting to continue to conceal her criminal acts. Whether her statements had an 
“appropriate purpose,” Block 691 F. Supp. at 699-700 (Sweet, J.) — or were, rather, efforts by a 
criminal organization to silence its victims — is obviously contested. Accordingly, obvious issues 
of fact exist as to whether or not Defendant contemplated litigation. 

Distorting reality, Defendant further argues: “Statements pertinent to a good faith 
anticipated litigation made by attorneys (or their agents under their direction) before the 
commencement of litigation are privileged.” (MSJ at 33). The record evidence shows that 
Defendant’s attorney did not make the defamatory statement. Further, Defendant’s attorney’s 
agents did not make the defamatory statement. Defendant did. And, there was no statement made 
by anyone “before the commencement of litigation” because /itigation never commenced. 
Accordingly, the cases Defendant cites where attorneys are making statements (or where clients 
are making statements to their attorneys regarding judicial proceedings including malpractice) 


are wholly inapposite as detailed below. 


45 


¢ Front v. Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 720 (2015) - statement made by attorney.

opinion outside courthouse calling plaintiff liar . . . is not similarly immune.” (This case undermines the false 
argument Defendant tries to make).

firm sued for defamation. 








ue was made by an 
iable controversy against the 





42 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page51 of 74 


Similarly, in Black v. Green Harbour Homeowners’ Ass'n, Inc., 19 A.D.3d 962, 963, 798 
N.Y.S.2d 753, 754 (2005), cited by Defendant, the Court held a privilege applied to a letter sent 
by a home owner’s association board of directors to the association’s members informing them 
of the status of litigation to which the association was a party, and to the association’s letter to 
the state attorney general sent to discharge it’s duties to the association. In this case, litigation 
was actually pending, the communication was sent by a party to that litigation as part of its 
duties, and the communication itself concerned the litigation. Defendant’s press release fits none 
of those descriptions. 

Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites to no case in which a Court has held that this or any 
qualified privilege extends to internationally disseminated press releases defaming a non-party to 
the purported “anticipated” litigation. Regardless of whether or not Barden had a hand in drafting 
the statement (another disputed issue of fact for the jury), Defendant issued the statement, 
instructed that it be published, and the statement she issued was attributed to her, and not to her 
attorney (or his agents). Accordingly, all the case law Defendant cites about an attorney making 
a statement (or a client making a statement to their attorney or malpractice carrier) is inapposite. 


2. Defendant is foreclosed from using the pre-litigation privilege because 
she acted with malice. 


In any event, because Defendant acted with malice, she cannot avail herself of the pre- 
litigation privilege. As this Court has explained denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss, “‘There 
is no qualified privilege under New York law when such statements are spoken with malice, 
knowledge of their falsity, or reckless disregard for their truth.’” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. 
Supp. 3d at 155 (citing Block, 691 F. Supp. at 699 (Sweet, J.) (S.D.N.Y. 1988). There is ample 
record evidence that Defendant acted with malice in issuing the press release, thereby making the 


litigation privilege inapplicable. See Block, 691 F. Supp. at 700 (Sweet, J.) (“Here, sufficient 


43 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page52 of 74 


evidence has been adduced to support the inference that [defendant] acted with malice, and may 
not, therefore, claim a qualified privilege under New York law . . . a genuine issue as to malice 
and appropriate purpose has properly been raised and is sufficient to preclude summary 
judgment.”). For example, Ms. Sjoberg testified that Defendant recruited her for sex with 
Epstein, thus corroborating Ms. Giuffre’s own account of Defendant’s involvement in abusing 
her with Epstein. For another example, Jeffrey Epstein’s pilot testified that Defendant flew with 
Ms. Giuffre on at least 23 flights, thus corroborating Ms. Giuffre’s claims against Defendant. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 15, Rodgers Dep. Tr., at 34:3-10. For another example, Tony 
Figueroa testified that Defendant asked him for assistance in recruiting girls for Epstein — more 
testimony that corroborates Ms. Giuffre’s claims against Defendant. 

Defendant’s statements that Ms. Giuffre was lying and her claims of sexual abuse were 
“obvious lies” were not pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation but, instead, they were 
made for an inappropriate purpose — i.e., to bully, harass, intimidate, and ultimately silence Ms. 
Giuffre. As the record evidence shows, Defendant knew the statements were false because 
Defendant engaged in and facilitated the sexual abuse of this minor child, therefore, they were 
made for the inappropriate purpose of “bullying,” “harassment,” and “intimidation.” See Front v. 
Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d 713, 720 (2015). Simply put, Defendant sexually trafficked Ms. Giuffre — and 
then tried to silence Ms. Giuffre to keep her crimes secret — circumstances that prevent her from 
using privileges designed to shield legitimate legal disputes from court interference. 

New York case law fully confirms that pre-litigation qualified privilege does not apply to 
this case. Historically, statements made in the course of litigation were entitled to privilege from 
defamations claims “so that those discharging a public function may speak freely to zealously 


represent their clients without fear of reprisal or financial hazard.” Jd. at 718. A 2015 New York 


44 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page53 of 74 


Court of Appeals case somewhat extended this privilege by holding that statements made by 
attorneys prior to the commencement of the litigation are protected by a qualified privilege if 
those statements are pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation. /d. at 718. (“Although it is 
well settled that statements made in the course of litigation are entitled to absolute privilege, the 
Court has not directly addressed whether statements made by an attorney on behalf of his or her 
client in connection with prospective litigation are privileged” . . . “to advance the goals of 
encouraging communication prior to the commencement of litigation” . . . “we hold that 
statements made prior to the commencement of an anticipated litigation are privileged, and that 
the privilege is lost where a defendant proves that the statements were not pertinent to a good 
faith anticipated litigation.”). 

The Court of Appeals’ reason for allowing this qualified privilege could not be more 
clear: “When litigation is anticipated, attorneys and parties should be free to communicate in 
order to reduce or avoid the need to actually commence litigation. Attorneys often send cease 
and desist letters to avoid litigation. Applying privilege to such preliminary communication 
encourages potential defendants to negotiate with potential plaintiffs in order to prevent costly 
and time consuming judicial intervention.” /d. at 719-20. Under this rationale, the Khalil court 
found that an attorney’s letters to the potential defendant were privileged because they were sent 
“in an attempt to avoid litigation by requesting, among other things, that Khalil return the alleged 
stolen proprietary information and cease and desist his use of that information.” /d. at 720. 

Here, quite unlike Khalil, the Defendant’s statements were (1) made by a non-attorney 
(Defendant through Gow); (2) concerning a non-party to any alleged anticipated litigation; (3) 


knowingly false statements; and (4) contained in a press release directed at, and disseminated to, 


45 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page54 of 74 


the public at large. Defendant’s statements cannot be considered “pertinent to a good faith 
anticipated litigation,” such that the qualified privilege should apply. 

Finally, though it strains credulity to even entertain the prospect, if Defendant could 
make even colorable showings on these basic issues, it would remain an issue of fact for the jury 
to determine whether or not Defendant’s press release, calling Ms. Giuffre’s sex abuse claims 
“obvious lies,” was any type of “cease-and-desist” statement or a statement that acted to “reduce 
or avoid” or resolve any “anticipated” litigation. Summary judgment is obviously inappropriate 
here as well. 


3. Defendant cannot invoke the pre-litigation privilege because she has 
no “meritorious claim” for “good faith” litigation. 


Finally, Defendant cannot prevail in asserting this qualified privilege because, in order to 
invoke this privilege, she must have “meritorious claims” for “good faith anticipated litigation.” 
Khalil specifically states that for the qualified privilege to apply, the statements must be made 
“pertinent to a good faith anticipated litigation,” and it does not protect attorneys . . . asserting 
wholly unmeritorious claims, unsupported in law and fact, in violation of counsel’s ethical 
obligations.” Khalil, 24 N.Y.3d at 718, 720 (emphasis added). Defendant has neither 
“meritorious claims” nor “good faith anticipated litigation.” Defendant cannot have a 
“meritorious claim” for “good faith anticipated litigation” against the press (or Ms. Giuffre) 
because Ms. Giuffre’s reports of her sexual abuse are true, Defendant knows that they are true, 
and Defendant made a knowingly false statement when she called Ms. Giuffre a liar. Under these 
circumstances, Defendant has no “meritorious” claim to make in “good faith” relating to either 
Ms. Giuffre’s statements or their coverage in the press, thereby making her defamatory 


statements wholly outside the protection of this qualified privilege. At the very least, the issue of 


46 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page55 of 74 


whether Defendant has meritorious claims against the press on the grounds that she did not abuse 
Ms. Giuffre is a question of fact for the jury to decide. 


Vv. DEFENDANT HAS NOT - AND CANNOT - SHOW THAT HER DEFAMATORY 
STATEMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE 


Defendant next claims that her press release calling Ms. Giuffre a liar about her past sex 
abuse was somehow “substantially true.” Here again, this is a highly disputed claim. On its face, 
to determine what is “substantially” true or not requires extensive fact finding, such as whether 
Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre as a minor child for sex with Defendant’s live-in boyfriend and 
convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate. See 
Mitre Sports Intern. Ltd. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 255 (S.D.N.Y.2014) 
(denying summary judgment because it would require the Court to decide disputed facts to 
determine whether the statement at issue was substantially true); Da Silva v. Time Inc., 908 F. 
Supp. 184, 187 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (denying motion for summary judgment because there was a 
genuine issue of material act as to whether defamatory photo and caption were not true, stating 
“{iJn the instant case Da Silva’s contention that she was a reformed prostitute at the time of 
photography and publication provides a rational basis upon which a fact-finder could conclude 
that the photograph was not substantially true”). 

Additionally, Defendant has remarkably not submitted any evidence that she did not 
recruit Ms. Giuffre for sex with Epstein. Nor has Defendant offered any evidence that her role in 
Epstein’s household was not to recruit girls and young women for Jeffrey Epstein. Accordingly, 
summary judgment is inappropriate. See Stern v. Cosby, 645 F. Supp. 2d 258, 277 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009) (because defendant had “not submitted any evidence to show that Statement 11 is 


substantially true, her motion for summary judgment as to Statement 11 is denied”). 


47 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page56 of 74 


Further, much of the purported evidence upon which Defendant relies to allege the truth 
of her defamatory statement is merely hearsay, including inadmissible hearsay statements made 
by Alan Dershowitz, who Defendant did not depose in this case (and whom Ms. Giuffre has not 
had an opportunity to cross examine). Hearsay cannot establish the truth of a defamatory 
statement as a matter of law at summary judgment. Lopez v. Univision Communications, Inc., 45 
F. Supp.2d 348, 359 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (denying summary judgment and holding “defendants’ 
evidence as to what they were told by representatives of NYU and Kean College, to the extent 
offered for the truth of the matters asserted, is inadmissible hearsay and an insufficient basis 
upon which to grant summary judgment of dismissal on the ground that the statements were 
substantially true.”). 

Finally, many of the facts upon which Defendant bases her argument that her defamatory 
statement was true are wholly tangential to the claims against her by Ms. Giuffre and the 
defamatory statement. For example, Defendant supports her contention that she did not recruit 
Ms. Giuffre for sex with Epstein based on the fact that Ms. Giuffre lived independently of her 
parents before meeting Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. (Of course, a child outside the supervision of 
her parents makes it much more likely she would be recruited by Defendant into sex trafficking, 
but that is for the jury to decide.) That fact does not go to whether or not Defendant’s statement 
calling Ms. Giuffre a liar is true, because Ms. Giuffre never made any claims relating to where 
she lived prior to meeting Defendant. Moreover, it is immaterial with whom she was living: the 
fundamental and overarching fact remains that Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre for sex with 
Epstein when she was a minor child. 

Defendant next proffers Ms. Giuffre’s limited high school enrollment and short-term jobs 


that she held as evidence that she and Epstein did not abuse her. The logic of this position is 


48 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page57 of 74 


unclear. The fact that Ms. Giuffre worked at Taco Bell for a few days hardly establishes she was 

not abused by Defendant and Epstein. Indeed, if anything its shows the vulnerability of Ms. 

Giuffre to enticements that a billionaire and his wealthy and powerful girlfriend could offer. In 

any event, what to make of such fact is something for the jury to consider. They are irrelevant for 

the same reason as above: Ms. Giuffre never made any claims about her studies or her prior 

employment. Indeed, neither Ms. Giuffre’s statement about being recruited by Defendant as a 

child, nor Defendant’s refutation even mentions Ms. Giuffre’s lack of schooling or lack of a 

stable home as a child. Purported facts that have nothing to do with Ms. Giuffre’s claims of 

sexual abuse against Defendant, and nothing to do with Defendant calling Ms. Giuffre a liar for 
such claims, do not establish the “substantial truth” of Defendant’s statement. Tellingly, 

Defendant cites to no analogous case in any jurisdiction that even suggests otherwise. 

VI. PLAINTIFF DOES NOT NEED TO ESTABLISH MALICE FOR HER 
DEFAMATION CLAIM, BUT IN THE EVENT THE COURT RULES 
OTHERWISE, THERE IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT RECORD EVIDENCE 
FOR A REASONABLE JURY TO DETERMINE DEFENDANT ACTED WITH 
ACTUAL MALICE 
Defendant’s next (and, again, quite remarkable) argument is that Ms. Giuffre somehow 

will be unable to establish actual malice in this case. One would think that a sex trafficker calling 

one of her victims a liar would be a quintessential example of actual malice. Defendant’s 
spurious case citations and misplaced argument do not detract from this core fact. 


Though Defendant does not mention the legal standard for actual malice until she is 48 


pages into her 68-page brief,” the legal definition of actual malice, as defined by the United 


4 Though perhaps a scrivener’s error, Defendant errantly cites to two Supreme Court cases ~ Gerts v. Robert Welch, 
Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974) and Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767 (1986) — that arose out of the 
laws of Illinois and Pennsylvania, respectively, to support a proposition concerning New York law. Defendant also 
cites to Harte-Hanks Commc'ns, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 109 S, Ct. 2678, 105 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1989), 
wherein the ruling was not at summary judgment, and the plaintiff in the defamation case was a judicial candidate in 
a public election. 


49 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page58 of 74 


States Supreme Court, and reiterated by the Second Circuit, should be the light by which all of 
Defendant’s purported “facts” and argument should be viewed. “Actual malice” means that the 
statement was published with “knowledge that the statement was ‘false or with reckless 
disregard of whether it was false or not.’” Baiul v. Disson, 607 F. App'x 18, 20 (2d Cir. 2015), 
quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 280, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 
(1964). 

Defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre is a limited purpose public figure. While Ms. Giuffre 
disputes that claim, the issue is entirely irrelevant here because Ms. Giuffre will prove at trial, 
with overwhelming evidence, that Defendant made her statement calling Ms. Giuffre a liar with 
malice, fully knowing — as a sex trafficker — that it was false. Put another way, Defendant knew 
that Ms. Giuffre was telling the truth when she described how Defendant recruited her for sex as 
an underage girl and then sexually trafficked her with her boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein. 

The Second Circuit instructs that, “[o]n a motion for summary judgment, a court cannot 
try issues of fact; it can only determine whether there are issues to be tried. If, as to the issue on 
which summary judgment is sought, there is any evidence in the record from any source from 
which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party, summary 
judgment is improper.” Chambers v. TRM Copy Ctrs. Corp., 43 F.3d 29, 37 (2d Cir. 1994) 
(internal citations and quotations omitted). “As the moving party, Defendants have the burden of 
demonstrating an absence of clear and convincing evidence substantiating Plaintiffs’ claims.” De 
Sole v. Knoedler Gallery, LLC, 139 F. Supp. 3d 618, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Chambers). 

Defendant fails to meet her burden of demonstrating an absence of clear and convincing 
evidence substantiating Ms. Giuffre’s claims that Defendant acted with actual malice. Ms. 


Giuffre will easily be able to meet any trial burden of clear and convincing evidence of actual 


50 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page59 of 74 


malice. Tellingly, Defendant does not even attempt to address the documentary evidence, nor the 
testimonial evidence showing she was a recruiter of girls for Epstein. 

As shown above, far beyond showing that a reasonable inference could be drawn in her 
favor, which is all that is required at this point to defeat Defendant’s motion, Ms. Giuffre will 
easily be able to meet her trial burden of clear and convincing evidence of actual malice. 

Of course, a plaintiff need only show “actual malice” on the part of a defendant if that 
plaintiff is a public figure or a limited public figure, which Ms. Giuffre is not, as explained infra. 


VII. THE COURT NEED NOT REACH THE ISSUE, AT THIS TIME, OF WHETHER 
MS. GIUFFRE IS A LIMITED PURPOSE PUBLIC FIGURE 


For the reasons just explained, Ms. Giuffre will easily be able to prove actual malice at 
the trial in this case. Defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre “is a public figure who must prove actual 
malice.” MSJ at 49. Given the overwhelming proof of the second part of that statement, the 
Court need not spend its time considering the first. 

If the Court wishes to nonetheless consider the issue at this time, it is not appropriate for 
disposition at the summary judgment stage of this case. The defendant bears the burden of 
demonstrating that the plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure. See Lerman v. Flynt Distrib. 
Co., 745 F.2d 123, 136-37 (2d Cir. 1984). Defendant correctly articulates the legal test for a 
finding that a plaintiff is a limited purpose public figure, but glosses over the fact that all prongs 
of the test must be met in order for a court to make that finding. See, e.g., Contemporary 
Mission, Inc. v. N.Y. Times Co., 842 F.2d 612, 617 (2d Cir. 1988) (“[T]his court set forth a four 
part test for determining whether someone is a limited purpose public figure” (emphasis added)); 
Herbert v. Lando, 596 F. Supp. 1178, 1186 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (“The Second Circuit recently 
summarized the criteria” (emphasis added)), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 781 F.2d 298 (2d Cir. 


1986); cf: Nehls v. Hillsdale Coll., 178 F. Supp. 2d 771, 778 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (finding plaintiff 


Sl 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page60 of 74 


was not a limited public figure for failing one element of the Lerman test and thus denying 
defendant’s motion for summary judgment) (“The defendant has proven all of the elements but 
the third ...”), aff'd, 65 F. App’x 984 (6th Cir. 2003). Of course, proof that Ms. Giuffre (or 
anyone else) is a limited purpose public figure requires proof of a set of facts from which Ms. 
Giuffre believes Defendant has not shown in satisfaction of the four-part test. 

Significantly this Court should pause here to note that the details of Jane Doe 3’s sexual 
exploitation and abuse, as anonymously set forth in her CVRA joinder motion, caused the 
Defendant to identify, with certainty, Jane Doe 3 as Ms. Giuffre. Yet, at her deposition, 
Defendant claimed to “barely remember her at all.”*” Defendant’s ability to immediately and 
positively identify the anonymous individual making claims of sexual abuse, if anything, shows 
that Defendant was intimately aware of Ms. Giuffre’s sexual exploitation. 

And, to be sure, Ms. Giuffre never asked to be sexually abused or trafficked by 
Defendant or convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when she was a child — legally, she did not 
even have the capacity to consent. Defendant cannot recruit a minor child for sexual exploitation 
and then, afterwards, argue that her victim injected herself into the public controversy when 
coming forward about the abuse she suffered. 

Moreover, Defendant has not made a sufficient showing that Ms. Giuffre has “regular” 
and “continuing” access to the news media. The policy rationale behind this prong is that public 
figures generally enjoy significant access to the media. One reporter wrote some articles on Ms. 
Giuffre in 2011. Thereafter, it was not until 2015, that Ms. Giuffre spoke to someone in the news 
media about these issues, and that interview was granted after Defendant’s defamatory remarks. 
Such limited contacts precludes a finding that Ms. Giuffre is a limited public figure. See 


*” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell Dep. Tr. at 44:23-45:4 (July 22, 2016) (“Q. You do remember 
Virginia, about that time back in the 2000s, giving Mr. Epstein massages? A. I barely remember her at all.”). 


52 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page61 of 74 


Hutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 99 S. Ct. 2675, 61 L.Ed.2d 411 (1979) (finding plaintiff 
maintained no regular and continuing access to the media and thus was not a public figure). 

It is also unclear how Defendant plans to show that Ms. Giuffre “successfully invited 
public attention to her views.” To be sure, Ms. Giuffre decided to start “Victims Refuse Silence,” 
a not-for-profit organization whose mission is “to change the landscape of the war on sexual 
abuse and human trafficking. Our goal is to undertake an instrumental role in helping survivors 
break the silence associated with sexual abuse. To fulfill this mission, we aim to enhance the 
lives of women who have been victimized.”** The website lists the National Trafficking Hotline, 
and provides a state-by-state resources for local organizations where victims can seek help. 
Unsurprisingly, Defendant cites no cases that hold that maintaining a website makes one a public 
figure. See Mitre Sports Int'l Ltd. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 22 F. Supp. 3d 240, 252 (S.D.N.Y. 
2014) (finding plaintiff was not a limited public figure and denying defendant’s motion for 
summary judgment) (“corporate policy denouncing child labor on its website ... do[es] not show 
that Mitre ... aimed to influence the public’s views on the controversy”). More important, 
Defendant does not explain how Ms. Giuffre was using the website to influence public views on 
whether she had been abused by Defendant — the subject at issue in this lawsuit. 

Interestingly, Defendant has spent $ 17,875“ on an expert witness to tell the Court and 
the jury that hardly anyone searches on the internet using search terms such as “victims refuse 
silence sex slave.” One of Defendant’s six briefs raising Daubert issues specifically argues that 
Dr. Anderson’s estimates on the cost of remediating Ms. Giuffre’s online reputation are improper 
because Dr. Anderson included nearly unused search phrases when evaluating internet content. 
Kent’s rebuttal report states: “. . . there seems no reason to believe that such a person would use 


“Shttp://www.victimsrefusesilence.org/our-mission. 
*® See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 9, Kent Dep. Tr. at 25:16-26:6. 


53 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page62 of 74 


this term . . . Indeed, these are terms unlikely to be used by anyone unfamiliar with this litigation. 
. .. Why, for instance, would it be necessary to push down offending Web pages in the results 
that the search engines provide for the term victim’s refuse silence sex slave, when this term is 
likely never used . . .” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 25, Kent Report at 10, 33. 

Defendant cannot argue to the Court that Ms. Giuffre has “successfully” invited public 
attention to her views through her VRS website while simultaneously filing a Daubert motion 
that argues that search terms such as “victims refuse silence sex slave” are “likely never used,” 
thus making the website unsuccessful in inviting public attention. In any event, Defendant has 
failed to set forth with precision the allegedly undisputed fact — and supporting evidence — she 
uses to support her argument. 

Moreover, “[i]t is preferable to reduce the public figure question to a more meaningful 
context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual’s participation in the particular 
controversy giving rise to the defamation.” Greenberg v. CBS Inc., 69 A.D.2d 693, 704, 419 
N.Y.S.2d 988, 995 (1979) (emphasis added), citing Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 
345, 352, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789. The context here is highly significant. Ms. Giuffre 
never chose to participate in Defendant and Epstein’s underage sex ring, a “controversy” that 
gave rise to Defendant’s defamation. In arguing that Ms. Giuffre thrust herself into the public 
spotlight, Defendant conveniently leaves out the fact that it is by her doing that Ms. Giuffre is in 
this controversy in the first place. No minor child willingly becomes a participant in sexual 
abuse, and it is perverse for the abuser to argue that her victim deliberately became a subject of 
public attention when speaking out about that abuse for the purpose of advancing justice and 


helping other victims. 


54 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page63 of 74 


For all these reasons, the Court should simply decline to decide the public figure issue at 
this juncture. But if it chooses to reach the issue, it should reject Defendant’s unsupported 
argument. 

VII. THE JANUARY 2015 STATEMENT WAS NOT “SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE,” 

AND MS. GIUFFRE HAS PRODUCED CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE 

OF ITS FALSITY 

As a final argument, Defendant argues that her January 2015 statement was “substantially 
true.” Given that the statement argues that Ms. Giuffre lied when she said she was sexually 
trafficked by Defendant, the reader of Defendant’s motion might reasonably expect to see some 
evidence presented showing that Defendant was not a sex trafficker. Instead, the reader is treated 
to technical quibbles. For example, the lead argument to show the “substantial” truth of 
Defendant’s statement is the argument that Ms. Giuffre was not fifteen years old, but all of 
sixteen or seventeen years old when she was trafficked. As the Court knows (and can take 
judicial notice of), Florida law makes age eighteen the age of consent. Accordingly, it is no 
moment that Ms. Giuffre may have been mistaken about the exact year the sex trafficking 
started. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-only-of-sixteen-year-old-girls” defense. To 
even describe the defense is to show how meritless it is. 

More broadly, at issue are the statements Ms. Giuffre made regarding Defendant’s 
involvement in, and knowledge of, the sexual abuse and sex trafficking of Ms. Giuffre (and other 
minor girls) through a recruitment scheme executed by Defendant and Jeffrey Epstein. In 
response to those various statements, Defendant publicly claimed that, “the allegations made by 
(Ms. Giuffre) against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” Defendant continued that Ms. Giuffre’s 


“claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such....” Defendant, through her statement 


55 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page64 of 74 


intended to convey that Ms. Giuffre was lying about everything she had said against Defendant — 


“the allegations.” 


In sum and essence, those statements made by Ms. Giuffre about which Defendant 


released a public statement to exclaim were “untrue” and “obvious lies” were:

encounter was had; 

That Defendant and Epstein expressed approval for Ms. Giuffre, and offered her 
money in exchange for this erotic massage turned full sexual encounter;

better life in exchange for Ms. Giuffre acting sexually compliant and

56 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page65 of 74 


Defendant, by way of her January 2015 statement, declared that Ms. Giuffre lied about 
each and every one of these allegations regarding Defendant. In fact, Defendant clarified further 
this position in her deposition when she said repeatedly that everything Ms. Giuffre said about 
Defendant was totally false.*° The clarification in her deposition is identical in intention to the 
reasonable interpretation of her statement that Defendant made publicly, which has formed the 
basis of this defamation action—that Ms. Giuffre was lying about everything she said about 
Defendant, and that Defendant was not at all involved in the activity she was accused of 
engaging in. 

While her public statement could not have been more clear, as her deposition testimony 
further underscored, Defendant intended the world to believe that nothing Ms. Giuffre said about 
Defendant was true, and that Defendant was not at all involved with any of the things she was 
accused of, Defendant has decided in this motion to minutely dissect the nuance of Ms. Giuffre’s 
various statements to cause the Court to reach a far-fetched conclusion that Defendant’s 
insidiously false statement was somehow “substantially true.” Ironically, this 
repositioning amounts to nothing more than an admission by Defendant of the defamatory nature 
of her statement. 

A. When Ms. Giuffre Initially Described Her Encounters With Defendant and 

Epstein, She Mistakenly Believed the First Encounter Occurred During the 
Year 1999, 

Discovery has resulted in the production of records, including Ms. Giuffre’s employment 
records from Mar-a-Lago, which she did not possess at the time she was recounting her 
interactions with Defendant. Those records establish that the initial encounter wherein Defendant 


recruited Ms. Giuffre occurred during the year 2000 and not during 1999. Ms. Giuffre was 


* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 135:3-4; 178:15-178:24; 179:20-180:7; 228:7- 
229:10. 


s7 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page66 of 74 


sixteen years old before August 9, 2000, and turned seventeen on that date. It is unclear from the 
limited records available whether Defendant approached and recruited Ms. Giuffre before or just 
after Ms. Giuffre’s 17th birthday. However, what has now been established through numerous 
witnesses is that Defendant approached and recruited a minor child for the purposes of enticing 
that minor over to the house of Jeffrey Epstein, a currently-registered sex offender.*! The exact 
lure of Ms. Giuffre by Defendant - enticement of being paid money to give a billionaire a 
massage at his mansion - was used by Epstein and his many associates and employees to recruit 
dozens and dozens of other underage girls. There is no doubt that the crux of Ms. Giuffre’s 
statement on this point is that Defendant recruited her when she was only a minor child unable to 
consent to sex, not precisely how far under the age of consent she was. Defendant’s public claim 
that Ms. Giuffre’s account of this approach, and recruiting element, was “untrue” and “obvious 
lies” is not “substantially true,” but is itself an obvious lie — as Ms. Giuffre will prove to the jury 
at trial. 

B. Defendant’s January 2015 Statement Claiming as “Untrue” and an “Obvious 

Lie” the Allegation That She Regularly Participated in Epstein’s Sexual 
Exploitation of Minors and That the Government Knows Such Fact is Not 
Substantially True But Instead Completely False. 

Defendant next argues that she “accurately denied that [she] ‘regularly participate[d] in 
Epstein’s sexual exploitation on minors’ and that ‘the Government knows such fact.’”” MSJ at 58. 
It is not clear whether Defendant is nitpicking this statement by contesting whether she 
“regularly” participated in Epstein’s sexual exploitation or whether she did participate, but the 
Government was unaware of the extent of her involvement. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex- 


trafficker-but-only-on-Tuesdays-and-Thursdays” defense — here again, to simply recount the 


claim is to see its absurdity. 


*! See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, 5, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 94:24-95:2; Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21; 116:19- 
117:12. 


58 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page67 of 74 


Contrary to Defendant’s misleading, cherry-picked fragments of information she has 
chosen to use to support her point, there is an abundance of evidence clearly linking Defendant 
to Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors. As the Court is aware, numerous message pads were 
recovered from Epstein’s home indicating Defendant’s involvement in and knowledge of 
Epstein’s illegal exploitation. oe Additionally, numerous employees and others have testified 
about Defendant’s high-ranking position in the hierarchal structure of the sexual exploitation 
scheme. ™ In fact, multiple individuals, in addition to the Ms. Giuffre, have testified about 
Maxwell’s involvement in the exploitation of minors, including Ms. Giuffre.** 

Defendant also argues that one government investigator, Palm Beach, Florida, Detective 
Recarey, may not have been aware of her involvement in the sex trafficking. Defendant fails to 
cite another passage in Detective Recarey’s deposition, where he noted that he was aware of 
Defendant’s involvement with Epstein and the sexual exploitation of children.** But even 
assuming Recarey was unaware (which Ms. Giuffre strongly disputes), Defendant would have, at 
most, a “‘yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-I-successfully-hid-it-from-one-of-the-cops” defense — 
again, not a likely claim. 

More broadly, Ms. Giuffre’s statement about what the “Government” knew about sex 
trafficking was made in pleadings filed in a federal Court case attacking the decision of the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida to offer Jeffrey Epstein immunity from 
prosecution for federal sex trafficking crimes. Accordingly, to present an even arguable claim for 


summary judgment, Defendant would have to show that the U.S. Attorney’s Office (and its

Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page68 of 74 


investigators from the FBI) did not know about Defendant’s sex trafficking. This proof would 
need to include, for example, evidence that the FBI did not learn about Defendant’s sex 
trafficking when (among other things) Ms. Giuffre told FBI agents about it when she met with 


them in Australia in 2011. Here again, Defendant has no evidence to even begin making such a 


showing. 
c Defendant’s January 2015 Statement Claiming as “Untrue” or an “Obvious 
Lie” That Maxwell and Epstein Converted Ms. Giuffre Into a Sexual Slave is 
Not Substantially True. 


Defendant next argues that she accurately disputed Ms. Giuffre’s statement that 
Defendant held her as a “sex slave.” Relying on dictionary definitions of “slave” that define the 
term to refer to a “confined” person who is the “legal property” of another (MSJ at 59, citing 
Merriam-Webster, etc.), Defendant claims Ms. Giuffre was not confined or the property of 
Defendant. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-I-didn’t-use-chains” defense. And, once 
again, to even describe the defense is to refute it. 

Defendant does not explain why the jury would be required to use the held-in-chains 
definition of “slave” in evaluating her statement. Merriam-Webster (11" ed. 2006) also defines 
“slave” as “one that is completely subservient to a dominating influence” — a definition that fits 
Ms. Giuffre’s circumstances to a tee. As Ms. Giuffre has explained in detail, she was recruited as 
a minor child by Defendant, who then dominated her and used for sexual purposes. That 
testimony alone creates a genuine issue of fact on this point. 

From the context of all of Ms. Giuffre’s statements about Defendant, Ms. Giuffre has 
never said or implied that she was physically placed in a cage. Instead, she has described the vast 
disparity of power and the influence of Defendant and Epstein, the fear of disobedience, the 
typical locations of the abuse being in a private plane, in huge mansion manned with Epstein 


employed servants, a private island, or some inescapable place abroad in the presence of 


60 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page69 of 74 


Defendant, in addition to the continued — and fraudulent — promise of a better future, as those 
things that kept her retained in a situation of sexual servitude. While not physical chained, Ms. 
Giuffre was groomed as minor and trained, and these factors became her invisible chains. 
Indeed, as Ms. Giuffre’s expert on sex trafficking, Professor Coonan, has explained: 

Popular understandings of the term “sex slave” might still connote images of 

violent pimps, white slavery, or of victims chained to a bed in a brothel in the 

minds of some people. To call Ms. Giuffre a victim of sex trafficking would 

however very accurately convey the reality that she along with a great many other 

victims of contemporary forms of slavery are often exploited by the “invisible 

chains” of fraud and psychological coercion. 

See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 23, Coonan Expert Report at 20. 

If the Court takes as true, which it must for the purpose of this motion, that Ms. Giuffre 
was trafficked and used exclusively for sexual purposes by Defendant and Epstein, then the 
Court must also reach the conclusion at this stage that Maxwell’s assertion — that Ms. Giuffre’s 
description of being a sex slave is “untrue” or “obvious lies” — is not substantially true. There 
undoubtedly remains a genuine issue of material fact on this point, and in fact, Defendant’s 
position taken in this motion is tantamount to an admission of the truth of Plaintiff's statement 
about Defendant on this point. 

D. Any Statement of Misdirection Regarding Professor Alan Dershowitz is 

Nothing More Than an Irrelevant Distraction to The Facts of This Case and 


Matters Not on the Defense of Whether Defendant’s Statement Was 
Substantially True. 


Defendant next contends that she accurately recounted that Alan Dershowitz had denied 
having sex with Ms. Giuffre. MSJ at 60. Call this the “yes-I’m-a-sex-trafficker-but-she-was-not- 
trafficked-to-the-professor” defense. While it is accurate that Ms. Giuffre made allegations 
against Professor Dershowitz, those allegations are not at issue in this case. Defendant, in her 
defamatory statement, claimed that “the allegations made by [Ms. Giuffre] against Ghislaine 


Maxwell are untrue.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 26, GM_00068. In her deposition, 
61 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page70 of 74 


Defendant maintained the position that she “cannot speculate on what anybody else did or didn’t 
do.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 180:3-180:4. In fact, 
regarding Ms. Giuffre’s claims about others, Defendant unequivocally stated, “I can only testify 


to what she said about me, which was 1000 percent false.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 11, 





Maxwell 4-22-2016 Dep. Tr. at 228:10-228:12. 

Defendant Maxwell makes additional misstatements about Dershowitz’s production in a 
defamation action filed against him in her desperate attempt to have Dershowitz to jump aboard 
and help bail out her sinking canoe. While Ms. Giuffre can — and, if necessary, will — refute 
Dershowitz’s claim he was not a beneficiary of Epstein and Defendant’s sex trafficking, that is 
not relevant at this stage. Whatever may or may not have happened with Dershowitz (and Ms. 
Giuffre’s sworn statements that he sexually abused her is alone enough to create disputed facts 
on the issue of whether Defendant’s statements about him were “substantially true”) has no 
bearing whatsoever on the truth or falsity of the statements Ms. Giuffre made about Defendant. 

This case is not about whether Ms. Giuffre has ever made untruthful allegations against 
anyone, which she contends she has not, but about whether her allegations about Defendant 


were true, or whether those specific allegations were “untrue,” “obvious lies” as Defendant 
publicly proclaimed. These issues are disputed and must go to the jury. 

E. Contrary to Defendant’s Position, There is a Genuine Issue of Material Fact 
as to Whether She Created or Distributed Child Pornography, or Whether 
the Government Was Aware of Same. 

Defendant next argues that she did not create child pornography and that the Government 

knew this. Call this the “until-you-find-the-photos-I’ m-innocent” defense. Of course, as noted 


earlier, Defendant’s claim requires that she show that “the Government” — in context, the FBI 


and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida — “knew” that she had no 


62 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page71 of 74 


child pornography. Yet Defendant has offered no such evidence — much less evidence so 
powerful as to warrant summary judgment on this point. 

This point is disputed from the simple fact that Ms. Giuffre herself testified that 
Defendant took many photograph of her naked. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. 
Tr. at 232:3-9; 233:7-9. This is consistent with the Palm Beach butler’s, Alfredo Rodriguez’s, 
testimony that he personally saw photos of naked children on Defendant’s computer. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24. Another 
housekeeper, Juan Alessi also saw photos of young nude females on Defendant’s computer, 
although he wasn’t sure whether to consider it pornography. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, 
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 175:5-175:24. Finally, Detective Recarey found a collage of nude photos of 
young females in Epstein’s closet, and turned the photos over to the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s 
office.*° While the U.S. Attorney’s office will not share the photos obtained from Recarey’s 
investigation, it is thus undisputed that the government possesses photos of nude, young females 
confiscated from Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Indeed, the police video disclosed through a 
FOIA request shows naked images of women throughout the house, including a full nude of the 
Defendant.*’ At a minimum, there is a clear genuine issue of material fact in this regard. 


F. Defendant Did Act as a “Madame” For Epstein to Traffic Ms. Giuffre to The 
Rich and Famous. 


Defendant next argues that she did not act as a “Madame” for Epstein. MSJ at 63. The 
gist of the argument seems to be that Defendant believes trafficking one girl to Epstein does not 
a Madame make. Call this the “yes-I-was-Virginia’s-Madame-but-no-one-else’s” defense. This 


argument fails linguistically on the very dictionary definitions that Defendant cites elsewhere — 


* See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24; 74:2-74:7. 
*” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 44, FOIA CD GIUFFRE 007584. 


63 


Case 18-2868, Document 280, 08/09/2019, 2628232, Page72 of 74 


but not here. See Merriam-Webster (1 1" ed. 2006) (defining “madam” as “the female head of a 
house of prostitution”). 

Once again, Defendant conceals the relevant facts on this issue. First, multiple witnesses 
have testified to Defendant’s recruiting, maintaining, harboring, and trafficking girls for 
Epstein.** In fact, Defendant herself was unable to deny procuring Ms. Giuffre for Epstein.” 
While Defendant has attempted to fumble her way through explaining some plausible reason for 
bringing a sixteen or seventeen year old to Epstein, her explanations are, to put it blandly, 
unpersuasive. As with other issues, the jury will have to decide who to believe. 

One of the individuals Ms. Giuffre was trafficked to was Prince Andrew — trafficking that 
took place in Defendant’s own townhouse in London. There exist flight logs evidencing Ms. 
Giuffre flying to London alongside Defendant and Epstein on Epstein’s private plane, and a 
photo of Ms. Giuffre, Defendant, and the Prince, without Defendant ever offering a legal 
reasonable explanation for that photo being taken, or for traveling with a year old girl overseas. 

Defendant begins to meander somewhat aimlessly on this point, shifting Plaintiff's 
burden to substantiate Plaintiff's claim that Defendant was Epstein’s Madame, which is a point 
at issue, into whether or not Plaintiff has conclusively proven the identities and accurate job titles 
of the other men to whom Plaintiff was lent for sex by Epstein. No matter how hard Defendant 
tries to reframe this case, drag other people in, or split hairs, she is unable to contest the facts — 
facts showing she was more than a Madame but a full-fledged sex trafficker. Ms. Giuffre told the 


truth when she said that Defendant recruited her as a minor, under the pretense of giving a

massage, and converted her into a traveling sex slave, consistent with Defendant and Epstein’s 
pattern and practice. 
As the Court astutely acknowledged early on, “at the center of this case is the veracity of 
a contextual world of facts more broad than the allegedly defamatory statements . . . either 
transgression occurred or it did not. Either Maxwell was involved or she was not.” If Defendant 
was involved, then her January 2015 statement was defamatory. Ms. Giuffre will prove to the 
jury, through overwhelming evidence, her prior allegations about Defendant’s involvement. The 
Court should give Ms. Giuffre that opportunity, and deny Defendant’s motion for summary 
judgment. 
Ix. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Defendant’s motion for summary 
judgment in all respects.

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Pagel of 66 


United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 


Virginia L. Giuffre, 

Plaintiff, Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS 
v. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 


Defendant. 


SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK LOCAL RULE 56.1 PLAINTIFF’S 
STATEMENT OF C STED FACTS AND PLAINTIFF’S UNDISPUTED FACTS 





DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


A Ms. Maxwell’s response to publications of Ms. Giuffre’s false allegations: the March 
2011 statement. In early 2011 Ms. Giuffre in two British tabloid interviews made 
numerous false and defamatory allegations against Ms. Maxwell. In the articles, Ms. 
Giuffre made no direct allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in any improper 
conduct with Jeffrey Epstein, who had pleaded guilty in 2007 to procuring a minor for 
prostitution. Nonetheless, Ms. Giuffre suggested that Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein 
and may have known about the crime for which he was convicted. 

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Ms. Giuffre denies that the allegations she made against Ms. Maxwell are false. 

Furthermore, Ms. Giuffre did give an interview to journalist, Sharon Churcher, in which Ms. 

Giuffre accurately and truthfully described Defendant Maxwell's role as someone who recruited 

or facilitated the recruitment of young females for Jeffrey Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at 

Exhibit 34, GIUFFRE003678. Ms. Giuffre was also interviewed by the FBI in 2011 and she 

discussed Defendant’s involvement in the sexual abuse. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31, FBI 


Redacted 302, FIUFFRE001235-1246. Those statements were not "false and defamatory," but 


instead truthful and accurate. 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page2 of 66 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


2. In the articles, Ms. Giuffre alleged she had sex with Prince Andrew, “a well-known 
businessman,” a “world-renowned scientist,” a “respected liberal politician,” and a 
“foreign head of state.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Ms. Giuffre does not contest this fact, but believes that it is irrelevant. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


3. In response to the allegations Ms. Maxwell’s British attorney, working with Mr. Gow, 
issued a statement on March 9, 2011, denying “the various allegations about [Ms. 
Maxwell] that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely 
false.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
Ms. Giuffre denies that Mr. Barden, “issued a statement.” Instead it appears to have the 
contact as Ross Gow and a reference to Devonshire Solicitors. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
4. The statement read in full: 


Statement on Behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell 
By Devonshires Solicitors, PRNE Wednesday, March 9, 2011 


London, March 10, 2011 - Ghislaine Maxwell denies the various allegations about her 
that have appeared recently in the media. These allegations are all entirely false. 


It is unacceptable that letters sent by Ms. Maxwell’s legal representatives to certain 
newspapers pointing out the truth and asking for the allegations to be withdrawn have 
simply been ignored. 


In the circumstances, Ms. Maxwell is now proceeding to take legal action against those 
newspapers. 


“T understand newspapers need stories to sell copies. It is well known that certain 
newspapers live by the adage, “why let the truth get in the way of a good story.” 
However, the allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask 
that they stop,” said Ghislaine Maxwell. 


“A number of newspapers have shown a complete lack of accuracy in their reporting of 
this story and a failure to carry out the most elementary investigation or any real due 
diligence. I am now taking action to clear my name,” she said.

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





The document speaks for itself although it is unclear if the original included the italics 

that are inserted by the Defendant above. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

5. Ms. Giuffre’s gratuitous and “lurid” accusations in an unrelated action. In 2008 two 
alleged victims of Epstein brought an action under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act against 
the United States government purporting to challenge Epstein’s plea agreement. They 


alleged the government violated their CVRA rights by entering into the agreement. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





While we would stipulate to the statement in this paragraph starting with the words “In 

2008” , we do not stipulate to the opening sentence fragment Maxwell places in bold. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

6. Seven years later, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre moved to join the CVRA action, 
claiming she, too, had her CVRA rights violated by the government. On January 1, 2015, 
Ms. Giuffre filed a “corrected” joinder motion. 

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
Agreed. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

7. The issue presented in her joinder motion was narrow: whether she should be permitted 
to join the CVRA action as a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21, 
specifically, whether she was a “known victim[] of Mr. Epstein and the Government 


owed them CVRA duties.” Yet, “the bulk of the [motion] consists of copious factual 
details that [Ms. Giuffre] and [her co-movant] ‘would prove . . . if allowed to join.”” Ms. 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page4 of 66 


Giuffre gratuitously included provocative and “lurid details” of her alleged sexual 
activities as an alleged victim of sexual trafficking. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Ms. Giuffre denies that the issues presented in here joinder motion were narrow. The 
issues presented by the joinder motion and related pleadings were multiple and complex, 
requiring numerous details about Ms. Giuffre’s sexual abuse and the perpetrators of her abuse. 
In a pleading explaining why the motion was filed, Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers specifically listed nine 
separate reasons why Jane Doe 3’s allegations that Dershowitz had sexually abused her were 
relevant to the case and appropriately included in the relevant filings: 


1. To establish that Jane Doe 3 had been sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein 
and his co-conspirators (including co-conspirator Alan Dershowitz), which would make 
her a “victim” of a broad sex trafficking conspiracy covered by the federal Crime 
Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, and therefore entitled to participate in the case; 


2. To support then-pending discovery requests that asked specifically for 
information related to contacts by Dershowitz with the Government on behalf of 
Jeffrey Epstein; 


3. To support the victims’ allegation that the Government had a motive for 
failing to afford victims with their rights in the criminal process — specifically, 
pressure from Dershowitz and other members of Epstein’s legal defense team to 
keep the parameters of the non-prosecution agreement (NPA) secret to prevent 
Jane Doe 3 and other victims from objecting to and blocking judicial approval of 
the agreement; 


4. To establish the breadth of the NPA’s provision extending immunity to 
“any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” and the scope of the remedy that the 
victims (including not only Jane Doe 3 but also other similarly-situated minor 
victims who had been sexually abused by Dershowitz) might be able to obtain for 
violations of their rights; 


5. To provide part of the factual context for the scope of the “interface” 
between the victims, the Government, and Epstein’s defense team — an interface 
that was relevant under Judge Marra’s previous ruling that the Government was 
entitled to raise “a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be considered in 
the factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant 
prosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims . . .”; 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Paged of 66 


6. To prove the applicability of the “crime/fraud/miscon duct” exception to 
the attorney-client privilege that was being raised by the Government in 
opposition to the victims’ motion for production of numerous documents; 
7. To bolster the victims’ argument that their right “to be treated with 
fairness,” 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), had been violated through the Government’s 
secret negotiations with one of their abusers; 
8. To provide notice and lay out the parameters of potential witness 
testimony for any subsequent proceedings or trial — i.e., the scope of the testimony 
that Jane Doe 3 was expected to provide in support of Jane Doe | and Jane Doe 2, 
the already-recognized Ms. Giuffre in the action; and 
9. To support Jane Doe 3’s argument for equitable estoppel to toll the six- 
year statute of limitations being raised by the Government in opposition to her 
motion to join — i.e., that the statute was tolled while she was in hiding in 
Australia due to the danger posed by Epstein and his powerful friends, including 
prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz. 
Jane Does #1 and #2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736, DE 291 at 18-26 & n.17 (S.D. Fla. 
2015). Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers had attempted to obtain a stipulation from the Government on 
point #1 above (“victim” status), but the Government had declined. Judge Marra’s ruling 
concluded that certain allegations were not necessary “at this juncture in the proceedings.” DE 
324 at 5. Judge Marra specifically added, however, that “Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these 
factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should Petitioners demonstrate a good faith 
basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter presented for the Court’s 
consideration.” DE 324 at 6. The CVRA litigation continues and no trial has been held as of the 
filing of this brief. As such, the extent to which these factual details will be used at trial has not 
yet been determined. See Docket Sheet, Jane Does #1 and #2 v. U.S., No. 9:08-cv-80736. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
8. At the time they filed the motion, Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew that the media had 
been following the Epstein criminal case and the CVRA action. While they deliberately 
filed the motion without disclosing Ms. Giuffre’s name, claiming the need for privacy 


and secrecy, they made no attempt to file the motion under seal. Quite the contrary, they 
filed the motion publicly.

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


9. 


As the district court noted in ruling on the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre “name[d] several 
individuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they 
took place.” The court ruled that “these lurid details are unnecessary”: “The factual 
details regarding whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are 
immaterial and impertinent . . ., especially considering that these details involve non- 
parties who are not related to the respondent Government.” Accordingly, “[t]hese 
unnecessary details shall be stricken.” /d. The court then struck all Ms. Giuffre’s factual 
allegations relating to her alleged sexual activities and her allegations of misconduct by 
non-parties. The court said the striking of the “lurid details” was a sanction for Ms. 
Giuffre’s improper inclusion of them in the motion. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


10. 


The district court found not only that the “lurid details” were unnecessary but also that 
the entire joinder motion was “entirely unnecessary.” Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers knew 
the motion with all its “lurid details” was unnecessary because the motion itself 
recognized that she would be able to participate as a fact witness to achieve the same 
result she sought as a party. The court denied Ms. Giuffre’s joinder motion.

See Ms. Giuffre’s Response to Point #7, above. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


1d, 


One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named” repeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. 
Maxwell. According to the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. 
Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme” created 
by Epstein: 


= Ms. Maxwell “approached” Ms. Giuffre in 1999 when Ms. Giuffre was “fifteen 
years old” to recruit her into the scheme. 

= Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged 
girls for sexual activities.” 

= Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator” with Epstein in his scheme. 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page7 of 66 


= She “persuaded” Ms. Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to 
the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other 
children.” 

= At the mansion, when Ms. Giuffre began giving Epstein a massage, he and Ms. 
Maxwell “turned it into a sexual encounter.” 

= Epstein “with the assistance of’ Ms. Maxwell “converted [Ms. Giuffre] into...a 
“sex slave.’” Jd. Ms. Giuffre was a “sex slave” from “about 1999 through 2002.” 

= Ms. Maxwell also was a “co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse.” 

= Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea 
agreement, because the immunity protected her from prosecution “for the crimes she 
committed in Florida.” 

= Ms. Maxwell “participat[ed] in the sexual abuse of [Ms. Giuffre] and others.” 

= Ms. Maxwell “took numerous sexually explicit pictures of underage girls involved in 
sexual activities, including [Ms. Giuffre].” /d. She shared the photos with Epstein. 

= As part of her “role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring,” Ms. Maxwell “connect[ed]” 
Epstein with “powerful individuals” so that Epstein could traffic Ms. Giuffre to these 
persons. 

= Ms. Giuffre was “forced to have sexual relations” with Prince Andrew in 

= “[Ms. Maxwell’s] apartment” in London. Ms. Maxwell “facilitated” Ms. Giuffre’s 

= sex with Prince Andrew “by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein.” 

= Ms. Maxwell “assist[ed] in internationally trafficking” Ms. Giuffre and “numerous 
other young girls for sexual purposes.” 

= Ms. Giuffre was “forced” to watch Epstein, Ms. Maxwell and others “engage in 
illegal sexual acts with dozens of underage girls.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
See Ms. Giuffre’s Response to Point #7, above. Ms. Giuffre contests the reference to 
“lurid details”. Moreover, the testimony from numerous witnesses corroborates the statements

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
12. In the joinder motion, Ms. Giuffre also alleged she was “forced” to have sex with 
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, “model scout” Jean Luc Brunel, and “many 
other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful 
business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world 


leaders.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





See Response to Point #7 and 11, above. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


13. Ms. Giuffre said after serving for four years as a “sex slave,” she “managed to escape to a 
foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


Agreed that Ms. Giuffre made this statement and has since discovered evidence that 
indicates she was mistaken on the exact timeframe of her abuse and was with Defendant and 
Jeffrey Epstein from the years 2000 — 2002. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

14. Ms. Giuffre suggested the government was part of Epstein’s “conspiracy” when it 
“secretly” negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding federal 
prosecution of Epstein and his “co-conspirators.” The government’s secrecy, Ms. Giuffre 
alleged, was motivated by its fear that Ms. Giuffre would raise “powerful objections” to 
the agreement that would have “shed tremendous public light on Epstein and other 
powerful individuals. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


Ms. Giuffre did not suggest that the Government was part of Epstein's conspiracy to 
commit sex offenses. The CVRA case deals with whether the Government failed in their 


responsibilities to the victims to inform the victims that the Government was working out a NPA, 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page10 of 66 


and it is Ms. Giuffre's belief that the Government did fail to so inform the victims, and 
intentionally did not inform the victims because the expected serious objection from many of the 
victims might prevent the Government from finalizing a NPA with Epstein. See McCawley Dec. 


at Exhibit 50, Joinder Motion (GIUFFRE00319-00333). 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
15. Notably, the other “Jane Doe” who joined Ms. Giuffre’s motion who alleged she was 
sexually abused “many occasions” by Epstein was unable to corroborate any of Ms. 
Giuffre’s allegations. 
MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
This is untrue. The other Jane Doe could corroborate many of Ms. Giuffre's allegations 
based on a similar pattern of abuse that she suffered by Epstein. She did not know Ms. Giuffre 
though. a. who was deposed in this case, and who was a minor, corroborates the 
same pattern of abuse. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 7, ef Dep. Tr. at 54:25-57:5. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
16. Also notably, in her multiple and lengthy consensual interviews with Ms. Churcher three 
years earlier, Ms. Giuffre told Ms. Churcher of virtually none of the details she described 
in the joinder motion. 
MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
This is untrue. Furthermore, Defendant does not offer any citation or evidence on this 
point. Defendant's statement here is knowingly false. Having read the articles and taken Ms. 
Giuffre's deposition, Defendant knows that Ms. Giuffre did reveal details in 2011 consistent with 
those in the joinder motion. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31, GIUFFRE003678, FBI Redacted 
302, GIUFFRE001235-1246. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


17. Ms. Maxwell’s response to Ms. Giuffre’s “lurid” accusations: the January 2015 
statement. As Ms. Giuffre and her lawyers expected, before District Judge Marra in the 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page11 of 66 


CVRA action could strike the “lurid details” of Ms. Giuffre’s allegations in the joinder 
motion, members of the media obtained copies of the motion. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
See Ms. Giuffre’s Response to Point #7, above. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


18. At Mr. Barden’s direction, on January 3, 2015, Mr. Gow sent to numerous representatives 
of British media organizations an email containing “a quotable statement on behalf of 
Ms. Maxwell.” The email was sent to more than 6 and probably less than 30 media 
representatives. It was not sent to non-media representatives. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Defendant falsely claims that “[a]t Mr. Barden’s direction, on January 3, 2015, Mr. Gow 
sent to numerous representatives of British media organizations an email containing ‘a quotable 
statement on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.’” This is a blatant falsehood about the document that is at 
the heart of this litigation. Record evidence shows that Gow sent that email at Defendant’s 
direction, not at Mr. Barden’s direction. Indeed, on the evening before his deposition, Mr. Gow 
produced an email exchange he had with Defendant in which Defendant directs Mr. Gow to send 


the press statement. It is as follows: 


From: G Maxwell <GMax1@elimax.com> 

Date: Fri, 2 Jan 2015 20:14:53 +0000 

To: Ross Gowcross@acuityreputation.com> 

Ce: Philip Barden<philip.barden@devonshires.co.uk> 
Subject: FW: URGENT - this is the statement 


Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts so not a new individual. 


The allegations made by Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. 


The original allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to 
be untrue 


Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public 
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschwitz is 
involved in having Sexual relations with her, which he denies 


Ms Roberts claims are Obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised 
as news, as they are defamatory. 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page12 of 66 


Chronologically, this email comes at the end of various other email exchanges between 
Defendant and Gow that discuss issuing a press release. The subject line of this email that 
Defendant wrote to Gow states “URGENT ~ this is the statement,” thereby instructing Gow to 
release this statement to the press. Shortly after Defendant sent this email to Gow directing him 
to release the statement, Gow distributed the statement to multiple media outlets. Neither 
Defendant nor Gow have produced any email in which Barden directed Gow to issue this press 
release (nor can they). 

Despite sending it herself, and despite it being responsive to six court-ordered search 
terms, Defendant failed to produce this email. Her press agent, Gow, produced this the evening 
before his deposition on November 17, 2016. At the deposition, Mr. Gow authenticated this 
email and confirmed that Defendant authorized the statement: 


Q. When you sent that email were you acting pursuant to Ms. Maxwell's retention of your 
services? 
A. Yes, I was. 
ae 
(Exhibit 9 was marked for identification.) 
Q. This also appears to be an email chain with you and Ms. Maxwell; is that correct? 
A. It does appear to be so. 
Q. Did you send the top email of the chain that says "Okay, G, going with this"? 
A. I did. 
Q. And did you receive from Ms. Maxwell, the bottom email of that chain? 
A. I believe so. Well, I believe -- yes, yeah, it was forwarded from Ms. Maxwell, yes. 
MR. DYER: Sorry, I don't quite understand that answer. 
THE WITNESS: I misspoke that. I did receive it from Ms. Maxwell. 
MR. DYER: Okay. 
Q. The subject line does have “FW” which to me indicates it’s a forward. Do you know 
where the rest of this email chain is? 
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not 
necessarily accessible at some point in time, so this had been sent to him originally by 
Ms. Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate 
action. I therefore respond, “Okay, Ghislaine, I’ll go with this.” 

It is my understanding that this is the agreed statement because the subject of the 
second one is “Urgent, this is the statement” so I take that as an instruction to send it out, 
as a positive command: “This is the statement.” 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page13 of 66 


See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, November 18, 2016, Ross Gow Dep. Tr. at 14:15-17; 44:6- 
45:13. 

Together, the email and Gow’s testimony unequivocally establish that Defendant — not 
Barden — directed and “command{ed]” Gow to publish the defamatory statement. Accordingly, 
the first sentence of Defendant’s Paragraph 18 is false. 

The second sentence — “This email was sent to more than 6 and probably less than 30 
media representatives” — omits the fact that not only did Gow admit to emailing the statement to 
the press, but he also read it to over 30 media representatives over the phone: 


Q. Do you recall ever reading the statement to the press or the media over the phone? 
A. It's very possible that I would have done so, yes. 


See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep. Tr. at 66:2-25. 
Q. Do you -- do you remember discussing that with The Guardian? 
A. No, I don't. I'm not saying I didn't but I can't recall. You have to bear in mind, if you'd 
be so kind, that I've been speaking to over 30 journalists and media outlets about this, 
and I can't recall every single -- the detail of every single conversation. 

See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep. Tr. at 64:8-14 (emphasis added). Thus, the second 

sentence of Defendant’s Paragraph 18 is also false. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

19. | Among the media representatives were Martin Robinson of the Daily Mail; P. Peachey of 
The Independent; Nick Sommerlad of The Mirror; David Brown of The Times; and Nick 
Always and Jo-Anne Pugh of the BBC; and David Mercer of the Press Association. 


These representatives were selected based on their request—after the joinder motion was 
filed—for a response from Ms. Maxwell to Ms. Giuffre’s allegations in the motion. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Ms. Giuffre agrees to the first sentence. The second sentence is a false. Accordingly, 
there is no record evidence that Gow (or anyone else) “selected” journalists “for a response,” or 
that there was any selection process whatsoever. To the contrary, Gow testified that anyone who 


inquired received a reference to the January 2015 defamatory response: 


13 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page14 of 66 


Q. To the extent you can recall or could estimate, how many other emails do you believe 
you sent bearing that statement that's in Exhibit 2? 


A. I really can't remember but certainly more than six and probably less than 30, 
somewhere in between. Any time there was an incoming query it was either dealt with on 
the telephone by referring them back to the two statements of March 2011 and January 
2015 or someone would email them the statement. So no one was left unanswered, 
broadly, is the -- is where we were. But I can't remember every single person we reached 
out to. 


See McCawley Dec at Exhibit 6 Gow Dep. Tr. at 67:15-68:1 (emphasis added).

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page16 of 66 


21. Mr. Barden, who prepared the January 2015 statement, did not intend it as a traditional 
press release solely to disseminate information to the media. So he intentionally did not 
pass it through a public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow’s firm, Acuity Reputation. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Defendant states: “Mr. Barden, who prepared the statement, did not intend it as a 
traditional press release solely to dissemination information to the media.” Ms. Giuffre contests 
this statement, and all statements regarding Mr. Barden’s beliefs and purposes, and the like. 

Further, as stated in detail in Ms. Giuffre’s Opposition Defendant’s Motion for Summary 
Judgment, this Court should not even consider the Barden Declaration. Additionally, there is 
absolutely no record evidence of Barden’s intent and the Court should not consider it. 

The next sentence states, “So he intentionally did not pass it [the press release] through a 
public relations firm, such as Mr. Gow’s firm, Acuity Reputation.” Again, there is zero record 
evidence to support any assertion of Barden’s intent. To the extent that this sentence claims that 
Barden did not give the statement to Gow, Ms. Giuffre does not dispute it; as described above, 
Defendant gave the statement to Gow with instructions to publish it. See McCawley Dec. at 
Exhibit 48, RG(UK)_000009, imaged in full at paragraph 81, supra. To the extent that this 
sentence claims that the statement did not pass “through a public relations firm, such as Mr. 
Gow’s firm, Acuity Reputation,” Ms. Giuffre disputes that statement. Record documentary 
evidence and testimony establish that this statement was disseminated through a public relations 
firm, namely, Ross Gow’s firm, Acuity Reputation. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep. 
Tr. at 109:4-6 (“Q. Approximately how long have you been providing such services? A. Acuity 


was set up in 2010.”).

ie) 
Nv 


The January 2015 statement served two purposes. First, Mr. Barden intended that it 
mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s reputation from the press’s republication of Ms. 
Giuffre’s false allegations. He believed these ends could be accomplished by suggesting 
to the media that, among other things, they should subject Ms. Giuffre’s allegations to 
inquiry and scrutiny. For example, he noted in the statement that Ms. Giuffre’s 
allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they are “obvious lies” and 
therefore should not be “publicized as news.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
Ms. Giuffre objects to this paragraph in its entirety. She disputes that the January 2015 
statement “served two purposes,” as this statement is wholly unsupported by the record, which 
Defendant again neglects to cite. Ms. Giuffre also contests the second sentence in which 
Defendant claims that “Mr. Barden intended that it mitigate the harm to Ms. Maxwell’s 
reputation from the press’s republication of Ms. Giuffre’s false allegations.” First, Ms. Giuffre 
disputes any statement of Barden’s intent as explained above. Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that 
there was any “republication” by the press as a matter of law, as explained in her memorandum 
of law opposing summary judgment, as the press did not “republish” the press statement under 
New York law. Third, Ms. Giuffre disputes that her allegations are “false,” and cites to the 
following non-exhaustive sampling of evidence to corroborate her allegations against Defendant:

used women and girls to collect underage girls for his abuse GIUFFRE005614-005700 
e See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 41, Epstein’s Flight Logs showing that Defendant flew 

with Ms. Giuffre 23 times GIUFFRE007055-007161 

Next, Defendant states, “He [Barden] believed these ends could be accomplished by 
suggesting to the media that, among other things, they should subject Ms. Giuffre’s allegations to 
inquiry and scrutiny.” Ms. Giuffre disputes any statement as to Barden’s “belief” (supra). Ms. 
Giuffre disputes that the harm to Defendant’s reputation could be mitigated by the media’s 
inquiry into and scrutiny of Ms. Giuffre’s allegations, because a deeper inquiry would only 
reveal additional evidence corroborating Ms. Giuffre’s allegations, such as the evidence put forth 
in Ms. Giuffre’s opposition memorandum of law and detailed in the bulleted citations, supra. 

Defendant then states, “For example, he [Barden] noted in the statement that Ms. 
Giuffre’s allegations changed dramatically over time, suggesting that they are ‘obvious lies’ and 
therefore should not be ‘publicized as news.”” First, Ms. Giuffre disputes that Barden noted 
anything in the statement, as that is unsubstantiated by the record evidence. Not to do 
Defendant’s work for her, but the closest evidence Defendant has for such a statement is 
testimony from the Gow deposition wherein Gow speculates that Barden “had a hand in” 
drafting the press statement, an opinion which may or may not be based on first-hand 
knowledge. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6, Gow Dep. Tr. at 45:14-17 (Q. Okay. A. And I say, 
“Thanks, Philip” because I’m aware of the fact that he had a hand, a considerable hand in the 
drafting.”) This is wholly insufficient to show who drafted the passages quoted by Defendant 
above. Regardless of those passages’ original author, it is ultimately Defendant who “noted” 


anything because it is her statement and she directed that it be sent to the media and public. 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page20 of 66 


Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that her allegations have changed over time, “dramatically” 
or otherwise. Third, Ms. Giuffre disputes that the press release “suggest[ed]” that her allegations 
are “obvious lies,” because Defendant’s press release affirmatively, unambiguously stated that 
her allegations are “obvious lies” — there is no subtlety, suggestion, or statement of opinion here. 
See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp.3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (“. . . these statements (as they 
themselves allege), are capable of being proven true or false, and therefore constitute actionable 
fact and not opinion.” 


DEFEN 





T’S PURPORTED FACTS 

23. Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be “a shot across the bow” of 
the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish Ms. Giuffre’s allegations 
without conducting any inquiry of their own. Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly 
noted that Ms. Giuffre’s allegations were “defamatory.” In this sense, the statement was 
intended as a cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients 


understand the seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of Ms. 
Giuffre’s obviously false allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

This paragraph is another purported statement of Defendant’s counsel’s “intent.” 
Defendant states: “Second, Mr. Barden intended the January 2015 statement to be a ‘shot across 
the bow’ of the media, which he believed had been unduly eager to publish Ms. Giuffre’s’ 
allegations without conducting any inquiry of their own.” Not only does Defendant once again 
refer to Mr. Barden’s intent, but she also mischaracterizes the statement as a “shot across the 
bow” of the media. The press release did not threaten or give warning to the media in any way 
whatsoever. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 26, GM_00068, full image copied in Ms. Giuffre’s 
Paragraph 18, supra. 

Next, Ms. Giuffre disputes the sentence, “Accordingly, in the statement he repeatedly 


noted that Ms. Giuffre’s allegations were ‘defamatory.’” Barden did not “note” anything in the 


statement, nor does Defendant cite to any record evidence that he does. Furthermore, Ms. Giuffre 


20 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page21 of 66 


denies that any of her allegations are defamatory in the slightest, as they are all true and 
substantiated by record evidence (supra). 

Ms. Giuffre also disputes the sentence, “In this sense, the statement was intended as a 
cease and desist letter to the media-recipients, letting the media-recipients understand the 
seriousness with which Ms. Maxwell considered the publication of Ms. Giuffre’s obviously false 
allegations and the legal indefensibility of their own conduct.” First, Ms. Giuffre objects to any 
statement of Barden’s intent, as articulated above. Second, Defendant’s conventional press 
release was in no way any type of “cease and desist letter.” There is no record evidence in 
support of this claim, and Defendant unsurprisingly cites to none. Third, Ms. Giuffre disputes 
that any media-recipients would be given to understand “the seriousness with which Ms. 
Maxwell considered the publication of Ms. Giuffre’s obviously false allegations and the legal 
indefensibility of their own conduct” by Defendant’s self-serving press release, as that is 
unsupported by the record. Finally, Ms. Giuffre rejects that her allegations are "obviously false,” 
a claim which is completely unsupported by record evidence. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
24. Consistent with those two purposes, Mr. Gow’s emails prefaced the statement with the 
following language: “Please find attached a quotable statement on behalf of Ms. 

Maxwell” (emphasis supplied). The statement was intended to be a single, one-time- 

only, comprehensive response—quoted in full—to Ms. Giuffre’s December 30, 2014, 


allegations that would give the media Ms. Maxwell’s response. The purpose of the 
prefatory statement was to inform the media-recipients of this intent. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





21 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page22 of 66 


Ms. Giuffre disputes that any part of Defendant’s press release is “consistent with those 
two [of Barden’s] purposes.” Indeed, Ms. Giuffre disputes this and any statement relating to 
Barden’s “purposes,” as explained above. 

Next, Ms. Giuffre disputes that, “The statement was intended to be a single, one-time- 
only, comprehensive response — quoted in full — to Ms. Giuffre’s December 30, 2014, allegations 
that would give the media Ms. Maxwell’s response.” First, Ms. Giuffre disputes this and any 
statement relating to Barden’s “intent” as explained above. Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that 
anyone intended the press release to be a one-time-only, comprehensive response. The record 
evidence says otherwise: Gow repeatedly issued this statement via email and over the phone for 
months on end. 

Next, Defendant states, “The purpose of the prefatory statement was to inform the media- 
recipients of this intent.” First, Ms. Giuffre disputes this and any statement relating to Barden’s 
purpose as explained above. Second, Ms. Giuffre disputes that the press release was to inform 
the media of anything. Defendant issued a press release, instructed them to publish it (by telling 
them it was “quotable”), see McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 48, RG(UK)_000009 (supra), and hired 
a press agent to feed it to the press: 


Q. Did Ms. Maxwell retain the services of you or your firm? 

A. Yes, she did. 

ae 

Q. Is it your belief that that agreement was in effect on January 2nd, 2015? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Do you recall the terms of that agreement? 

A. Well, it was a re-establishment of an existing agreement so if we go back to the 
original agreement, it was to provide public relations services to Ms. Maxwell in the 
matter of Giuffre and her activities. 


22 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page23 of 66 


See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6 Gow Dep. Tr. at 12:19-21; 13:9-16. The record evidence shows 
that Defendant’s intent was for the press to publish her press release: any other interpretation is 
not only contrary to logic, but unsupported by the record. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
25. Ms. Giuffre’s activities to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. Ms. 
Giuffre has engaged in numerous activities to bring attention to herself, to the prosecution 
and punishment of wealthy individuals such as Epstein, and to her claimed interest of 
bringing light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. 
MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
Agreed to the portion of Defendant’s assertion in bold font. Ms. Giuffre has not engaged 
in activities to bring attention to herself, rather she has taken action to aid in the prosecution of 
her abusers, and she seeks to bring light to the rights of victims of sexual abuse. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


26. Ms. Giuffre created an organization, Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida corporation, 
directly related to her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Ms. Giuffre created Victims Refuse Silence, Inc., in order to help other sexually 


trafficked victims find the resources they need to recover and heal. See 


www.victimsrefusesilence.org. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


27. The “goal” of Victims Refuse Silence “was, and continues to be, to help survivors 
surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual 
abuse.” Toward this end, Ms. Giuffre has “dedicated her professional life to helping 
victims of sex trafficking.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Agreed. 


23 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page24 of 66 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


28. Ms. Giuffre repeatedly has sought out media organizations to discuss her alleged 
experience as a victim of sexual abuse. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Denied. Ms. Giuffre was approached by numerous media outlets and refused to speak to 
most of them. Media organizations sought her out; she did not seek them out. See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 35, GIUFFRE003690, email from Sharon Churcher seeking to interview Ms. 
Giuffre. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


29. On December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre publicly filed an “entirely unnecessary” joinder 
motion laden with “unnecessary,” “lurid details” about being “sexually abused” as a 
“minor victim[]” by wealthy and famous men and being “trafficked” all around the world 
as a “sex slave.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





See Ms. Giuffre’s Paragraph 7, supra, listing multiple reasons why details were, in fact, 
necessary. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


30. The Ms. Giuffre’s alleged purpose in filing the joinder motion was to “vindicate” her 
rights under the CVRA, expose the government’s “secretly negotiated” “non-prosecution 
agreement” with Epstein, “shed tremendous public light” on Epstein and “other powerful 
individuals” that would undermine the agreement, and support the CVRA Ms. Giuffre’s’ 
request for documents that would show how Epstein “used his powerful political and 


social connections to secure a favorable plea deal” and the government’s “motive” to aid 
Epstein and his “co-conspirators.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
See Ms. Giuffre’s Paragraph 7, supra, listing multiple purposes of Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers’ 


filing of the motion. 


24 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page25 of 66 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


31. Ms. Giuffre has written the manuscript of a book she has been trying to publish detailing 
her alleged experience as a victim of sexual abuse and of sex trafficking in Epstein’s 
alleged “sex scheme.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





See Ms. Giuffre’s Paragraph 52, infra, explaining that the context of this statement is 
misleading. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


32. Republication alleged by Ms. Giuffre. Ms. Giuffre was required by Interrogatory No. 6 
to identify any false statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell that were “‘published globally, 
including within the Southern District of New York,’” as Ms. Giuffre alleged in 
Paragraph 9 of Count I of her complaint. In response, Ms. Giuffre identified the January 
2015 statement and nine instances in which various news media published portions of the 
January 2015 statement in news articles or broadcast stories. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Ms. Giuffre objects to this paragraph in its entirety, starting with the bolded heading 
(“Republication alleged by Ms. Giuffre”). There is no “republication” as a matter of law in this 
case, as explained in Ms. Giuffre’s memorandum of law. Accordingly, Ms. Giuffre is not and has 
not alleged republication. As noted in her objection that, it is Defendant who possesses the 
knowledge as to where the defamatory statements were published; unsurprisingly, Defendant 
failed to comply with Ms. Giuffre’s discovery requests on the same. 

As Defendant already knows, Ms. Giuffre provided a sampling of Defendant’s 
defamatory statements published by the news media, as “identification of an exhaustive 
responsive list would be unduly burdensome.” This, of course, is because Defendant caused her 
statement to be published in an enormous number of media outlets. Ms. Giuffre’s full response to 
Interrogatory No. 6 is below. As the Court can see, these nine instances were a good-faith effort 


to provide some samples (as it would be virtually impossible to provide all of them), below. Ms. 


25 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page26 of 66 


Giuffre has also put forth an exhaustive expert report and expert testimony from Jim Jansen 
regarding the dissemination of Defendant’s defamatory press release. 


Ms. Giuffre objects because the information interrogatory above is in the 
possession of Defendant who has failed to comply with her production obligations 
in this matter, and has failed to comply with her production obligations with this 
very subject matter. See Document Request No. 17 from Ms. Giuffre’s Second 
Request for Production of Documents to Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell 
has not produced all “URL or Internet addresses for any internet version of such 
publication” that she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to send. 


Ms. Giuffre further objects because the information requested above is in 
the possession of Defendant’s agent, who caused the false statements to be issued 
to various media outlets. Ms. Giuffre has not had the opportunity to depose 
Maxwell’s agent Ross Gow; therefore, this answer remains incomplete. 


Consequently, Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or supplement 
her responses, as information is largely in the possession of the Defendant and her 
agent. Ms. Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in that it violates Rule 33 as its 
subparts, in combination with the other interrogatories, exceed the allowable 
twenty-five interrogatories. Ms. Giuffre objects to this request because it is in the 
public domain. Ms. Giuffre also objects in that it seeks information protected by 
the attorney-client/work product privilege, and any other applicable privilege 
stated in the General Objections. 


Notwithstanding such objections, Ms. Giuffre has already produced 
documents supplements such responsive documents with the following list of 
publications. While the identification of an exhaustive responsive list would be 
unduly burdensome, in an effort to make a good faith effort towards compliance, 
Ms. Giuffre provides the following examples, which are incomplete based on the 
aforementioned reasons:

Ross Gow 


Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. 
The allegations made by Victoria Roberts against 
Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations 
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown 
to be untrue. 


Each time the story is re told it changes with new 
salacious details about public figures and world leaders 
and now it is alleged by Ms. Roberts that Alan 
Dershowitz is involved in having sexual relations with 
her, which he denies. 


‘Ms. Roberts's claims are obvious lies and should be 
treated as such and not publicized as news, as they are 
defamatory. 


Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and 
defamatory claims remains the same. Maxwell strongly 
denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have 
appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves 
her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old 
defamatory claims.

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


33. In none of the nine instances was there any publication of the entire January 2015 
statement. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





While there may be certain publications who did not print every word of Defendant’s 
lengthy press release, most publications quoted the most salient, to-the-point parts of 
Defendant’s statement that call Ms. Giuffre a liar. In each of the nine articles listed above, the 
defamatory statement, as articulated by the Complaint and as identified by the Court as 
actionable, is published. See Giuffire v. Maxwell, 165 F. Supp.3d 147, 152 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) 
(“statements that Giuffre’s claims ‘against [Defendant] are untrue,’ have been ‘shown to be 
untrue,’ and are ‘obvious lies’ have a specific and readily understood factual meaning: that 
Giuffre is not telling the truth about her history of sexual abuse and Defendant’s role, and that 
some verifiable investigation has occurred and come to a definitive conclusion proving that fact. 
Second, these statements (as they themselves allege), are capable of being proven true or false, 
and therefore constitute actionable fact and not opinion”). Ms. Giuffre also put forth extensive 
evidence of the mass distribution of Defendant’s defamatory statement to over 66 million 
viewers through her expert witness Jim Jansen. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 24, Expert Report 
of Jim Jansen. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
34. Ms. Maxwell and her agents exercised no control or authority over any media 
organization, including the media identified in Ms. Giuffre’s response to Interrogatory 


No. 6, in connection with the media’s publication of portions of the January 2015 
statement. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
Ms. Giuffre disputes this statement in its entirety, as it is completely devoid of record 


evidence. In fact, the record establishes the contrary. First, Defendant hired Gow because his 


28 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page29 of 66 


position allowed him to influence the press to publish her defamatory statement. A sampling of 


Gow’s testi 


imony establishes just that: 


Did Ms. Maxwell retain the services of you or your firm? 
Yes, she did. 


Is it your belief that that agreement was in effect on January 2nd, 2015? 

Yes. 

Do you recall the terms of that agreement? 

Well, it was a re-establishment of an existing agreement so if we go back to the 
original agreement, it was to provide public relations services to Ms. Maxwell in 
the matter of Giuffre and her activities. 


You can answer -- to the extent that anything you testify to is not protected by a 
privilege. 


Ms. Roberts first came to my attention on or around March 2011 when I was 


called into a meeting with Philip Barden and Ms. Maxwell at Devonshires law office, 


that

work commenced on or around March of 2011. 


Does this document fairly depict pages from your -- from Acuity Reputation's

It does. 

Do you see where it says "We manage reputation and forge opinion through 
lic relations, strategic communications and high level networking"? 

I do. 

Is that a true statement? 

Say it again. Sorry. 

Is that a true statement? 

It is, yes. I wrote that statement. 


Okay. Do you see where your website claims that your company has "excellent

I do. 

Is that a true statement?

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page30 of 66 


A. That is true, yeah.

Q. Is it correct that you advertise your “excellent relationships with the media" 
because your services often include giving communications to the media on

A. Yes. 


See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 6 Gow Dep. Tr. at 13:9-16; 15:18-16:3; 109:12-22; 110:16-21; 
111:3-7. In addition to testimonial evidence, the proof is also in the result. By using Gow to issue 
her press release, Defendant caused her statement to be published by numerous major news 
organizations with wide readership all over the globe. Accordingly, the record evidence shows 
that Ms. Maxwell, through her agent, had immense control and authority over the media, 
convincing major news outlets to publish her words based on nothing more than a single email 
from Gow. 


DEFEN. 





T’S PURPORTED FACTS 
35. Ms. Giuffre’s defamation action against Ms. Maxwell. Eight years after Epstein’s guilty 
plea, Ms. Giuffre brought this action, repeating many of the allegations she made in her 
CVRA joinder motion. 
MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
Agreed, but noting that the defamation cause of action against Defendant did not accrue 
until Defendant defamed her in January of 2015, the same year Ms. Giuffre filed suit against 
Defendant for defamation. 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


36. The complaint alleged that the January 2015 statement “contained the following 
deliberate falsehoods”: 


(a) That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.” 


(b) That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.” 
(c) That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.” 


30 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page31 of 66 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Agreed. However, in discovery, Defendant was finally forced to produce the complete 

press release she issued. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 26, GIUFFRE00068. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
37. Ms. Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her fiancé long before meeting Epstein 

or Ms. Maxwell. After leaving the Growing Together drug rehabilitation facility in 1999, 

Ms. Giuffre moved in with the family of a fellow patient. There she met, and became 

engaged to, her friend’s brother, James Michael Austrich. She and Austrich thereafter rented 

an apartment in the Ft. Lauderdale area with another friend and both worked at various jobs 
in that area. Later, they stayed briefly with Ms. Giuffre’s parents in the Palm Beach/ 

Loxahatchee, Florida area before Austrich rented an apartment for the couple on Bent Oak 

Drive in Royal Palm Beach. Although Ms. Giuffre agreed to marry Austrich, she never had 

any intention of doing so. 

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Ms. Giuffre did not voluntarily live independently from her parents with her fiancé, rather 
Ms. Giuffre was a troubled minor child who was not truly engaged prior to meeting Defendant and 
Epstein. Where Ms. Giuffre lived, and who she lived with, are not relevant to the issues being 
decided in this action. Again, this is merely a transparent distraction from the case that is 
actually at issue, and is being used for the sole purpose of inserting conjecture in an effort to 
distract the Court and ultimately the jury. 

Although Austrich testified that he proposed to Ms. Giuffre on Valentine’s Day, see 
Austrich at p. 19, Ms. Giuffre was a troubled teen who could not realistically be considered a 
fiancé in the true sense of the word, nor was she of legal age to marry. In fact, as accurately 
described by Defendant, Ms. Giuffre never had any intention of marrying Austrich. Giuffre Dep. Tr. 
at 127:22-128:21. Given that Ms. Giuffre was a child with limited legal capacity at this point, and 


that she did not have any intention of marrying Austrich, a reasonable person could not assert that 


Ms. Giuffre was engaged. 


31 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page32 of 66 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


38. Ms. Giuffre re-enrolled in high school from June 21, 2000 until March 7, 2002. After 
finishing the 9th grade school year at Forest Hills High School on June 9, 1999, Ms. 
Giuffre re-enrolled at Wellington Adult High School on June 21, 2000, again on August 
16, 2000 and on August 14, 2001. On September 20, 2001, Ms. Giuffre then enrolled at 
Royal Palm Beach High School. A few weeks later, on October 12, 2001, she 
matriculated at Survivors Charter School. Id. Survivor’s Charter School was an 
alternative school designed to assist students who had been unsuccessful at more 
traditional schools. Ms. Giuffre remained enrolled at Survivor’s Charter School until 
March 7, 2002. She was present 56 days and absent 13 days during her time there. Id. 
Ms. Giuffre never received her high school diploma or GED. Ms. Giuffre and Figueroa 
went “back to school” together at Survivor’s Charter School. The school day there lasted 
from morning until early afternoon. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Ms. Giuffre denies this statement. Either Defendant is blatantly misleading this Court or 
Defendant simply does not understand how to interpret Ms. Giuffre’s school records. The record 
produced by Defendant (GM0888) is specifically titled “A07. Assignment History,” which 
reflects semester start and end dates per each 180 day school year, not dates that Ms. Giuffre 


physically enrolled or withdrew from school. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 27, GM0888.

While “Grade 30” indicates adult education, Ms. Giuffre’s attendance records indicate that she 


was not present in school between 6/21/00-09/20/01 (see withdrawal codes W32 and W47).

http://www. fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/886 1 /urlt/0094063-appendb.pdf 





More importantly, Ms. Giuffre’s school transcripts clearly indicate “NO COURSES 
TAKEN” for the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 school years. (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 27, 
GM_00893.) Ms. Giuffre’s attempt to work and resume school at Survivor’s Charter School as a 
10" grader in the 2001-2002 school year was limited to a portion of the school year (10/20/01- 
03/07/02), and further substantiates Ms. Giuffre’s testimony that she attempted to get away from 
Epstein’s abuse, along with the following testimony by Figueroa: 


Q: Was there a period of time between 2001 and when she left in 2002 here she was 
not working for Jeffrey? 

Yes. 

What period of time was that? 

It was pretty much, like, when she was actually working as a server. Like, 
basically because we were trying to not have her go back there. Like, she did not 
want to go back there. And we were trying to just work without needing his 
money, you know.”

Q: So the thing that Virginia was tired of ... What was it that Virginia was trying to 
get away from and stop with respect to working at Jeffrey Epstein's house? 


A: To stop being used and abused.

Even still, if the records are correct, which Ms. Giuffre does not concede, the records 
indicate that Ms. Giuffre’s attendance was poor, with 69 days present and 32 days absent out of a 
required 180 day school year and that she was not enrolled at the end of the school year

See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 27, GM_00893. 

Ms. Giuffre’s obvious gap in her school attendance, her presence verified by Epstein’s 
pilot on flight logs, and an abundence of witness testimony all corroborate her story that she was 
that Ms. Giuffre was flying domestic and internationally with Epstein at least 32 times between 
12/11/00-07/28/01 and 06/21/02-08/21/02 (Defendant traveling with Ms. Giuffre on 23 of the 
flights). See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 15 and 41, Pilot, David Rodgers’ Dep. Tr. 96:12-166;

McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 104: 9-14 (Q: Do you know how long Virginia 
had been coming over to the house before she started traveling on an airplane with Ghislaine and 
Jeffrey? THE WITNESS: Not too long. I don't think it was too long after that); See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 37, GIUFFRE004721 (passport application). 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
39. During the year 2000, Ms. Giuffre worked at numerous jobs. In 2000, while living with 
her fiancé, Ms. Giuffre held five different jobs: at Aviculture Breeding and Research 

Center, Southeast Employee Management Company, The Club at Mar-a-Lago, Oasis 

Outsourcing, and Neiman Marcus. Her taxable earnings that year totaled nearly $9,000. 


Ms. Giuffre cannot now recall either the Southeast Employee Management Company or 
the Oasis Outsourcing jobs. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


35 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page36 of 66 


Ms. Giuffre disputes this statement. During 2000, Ms. Giuffre shared an apartment with 
her then boyfriend, James Michael Austrich and his friend, Mario. See McCawley Dec. at 
Exhibit 2, Austrich Dep. Tr. at p. 92. Although Austrich testified that he proposed to Ms. Giuffre 
on Valentine’s Day, see Austrich at p. 19, Ms. Giuffre was a troubled teen who could not 
realistically be considered a fiancé in the true sense of the word nor was she of legal age to 
marry. While Ms. Giuffre held various jobs in 2000, “[SSA] records do not show the exact date 
of employment (month and day) because [they] do not need this information to figure Social 
Security benefits.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 46, GIUFFRE009176). 

The reason that Ms. Giuffre cannot recall two companies listed on her SSA records 
(Southeast Employee Management Company or Oasis Outsourcing) is simply because they were 
not her employers. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 470-472. Had Defendant 
bothered to run a simple google search, she could have ruled them out as being payroll and 


benefit administration companies. See http://www.oasisadvantage.com/west-palm-beach-peo; 





http://www.progressiveemployer.com/; 
http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/2006050100615 1/en/Progressive-Employer-Services- 
Purchases-Southeast-Employee-Management. 

Ms. Giuffre has testified that she believes she worked at Taco Bell, at an aviary, then 
Mar-a-Lago (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at p. 53, 470). Austrich also 
testified that Ms. Giuffre worked with him at Taco Bell, as well as a pet store for “over a month” 
before working at Mar-a-Lago (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Austrich Dep. Tr. at p. 16, 30, 
98). Neither Taco Bell nor the pet store are listed on Ms. Giuffre’s SSA records because they 
were most likely paid through payroll companies. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 46, 


GIUFFRE009178. Ms. Giuffre also testified that she volunteered at an aviary where they 


36 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page37 of 66 


eventually put her on their payroll, but paid her very little. Giuffre Dep. Tr. at p. 52; Aviculture 
Breeding and Research Center taxable earnings for 2000 is $99.48, See McCawley Dec. at 
Exhibit 46, GIUFFRE009178. 


DEFEN. 





T’S PURPORTED FACTS 


40. Ms. Giuffre’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2000. Ms. Giuffre’s 
father, Sky Roberts, was hired as a maintenance worker at the The Mar-a-Lago Club in 
Palm Beach, Florida, beginning on April 11, 2000. Mr. Roberts worked there year-round 
for approximately 3 years. After working there for a period of time, Mr. Roberts became 
acquainted with the head of the spa area and recommended Ms. Giuffre for a job there. 
Mar-a-Lago closes every Mother’s Day and reopens on November 1. Most of employees 
Mar-a-Lago, including all employees of the spa area such as “spa attendants,” are 
“seasonal” and work only when the club is open, i.e., between November | and Mother’s 
Day. Ms. Giuffre was hired as a “seasonal” spa attendant to work at the Mar-a-Lago Club 
in the fall of 2000 after she had turned 17. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Ms. Giuffre disputes this statement. Defendant cannot simply infer Ms. Giuffre’s 
employment history and claim it to be undisputed. The Mar-a-Lago Club produced 177 pages of 
records in response to Defendant’s subpoena. However, not one page indicated Ms. Giuffre’s 
actual dates of employment, nor whether she was a full-time or seasonal employee. In fact, the 
only significant record produced was a single, vague chart entry indicating that Ms. Giuffre was 


terminated in 2000. MAR-A-LAGO 0173, 0176.

Job postings and job descriptions produced by Mar-a-Lago from 2002 and later are 
irrelevant to Ms. Giuffre’s employment because they are from after she worked there. Ms. 
Giuffre testified that Mar-a-Lago was a summer job. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre 
Dep. Tr. 56, 550. In fact, her father, Sky Roberts, testified that he referred his daughter for 
employment, and she did not get the job through a posting (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, 
Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 72); he drove his daughter to and from work consistent with his full time 
schedule (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 74); he believes the spa — 
like the kitchen/dining room - was open to local guests in the summer (See McCawley Dec. at 
Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. 138-139); and that his daughter was not attending school when 
she worked at Mar-a-Lago (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. 134). In 
addition, Juan Alessi testified that it was “Summer” when Defendant approached Ms. Giuffre at 
Mar-a-Lago because he specifically remembered “that day I was sweating like hell in the -- in 
the car, waiting for Ms. Maxwell to come out of the massage.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, 
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 94:24-95:2. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
Al. Ms. Giuffre represented herself as a masseuse for Jeffrey Epstein. While working at 
the Mar-a-Lago spa and reading a library book about massage, Ms. Giuffre met Ms. 

Maxwell. Ms. Giuffre thereafter told her father that she got a job working for Jeffrey 

Epstein as a masseuse. Ms. Giuffre’s father took her to Epstein’s house on one occasion 

around that time, and Epstein came outside and introduced himself to Mr. Roberts. Ms. 

Giuffre commenced employment as a traveling masseuse for Mr. Epstein. Ms. Giuffre 

was excited about her job as a masseuse, about traveling with him and about meeting 

famous people. Ms. Giuffre represented that she was employed as a masseuse beginning 
in January 2001. Ms. Giuffre never mentioned Ms. Maxwell to her then-fiancé, Austrich. 

Ms. Giuffre’s father never met Ms. Maxwell. 

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


Ms. Giuffre denies Defendant’s false and factually unsupported narrative. In Florida, a 


person cannot work as a masseuse unless she is “at least 18 years of age or has received a high 


38 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page39 of 66 


school diploma or high school equivalency diploma.” Fla. Stat. § 480.041. Ms. Giuffre was a 
minor child, under the age of 18, when she was working at Mar-a-Lago as a spa 
attendant. Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 61:9-61:24. She was approached by Defendant, who told her she 
could make money as a masseuse, a profession in which Ms. Giuffre had no experience. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 111:12-111:21; 116:19-117:12. (Sky Roberts, 
Ms. Giuffre father, verified Ms. Giuffre’s account that Defendant recruited his daughter to “learn 
massage therapy.” See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 17, Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 80:7-19; 84:18 - 
85:1). 

Ms. Giuffre’s father drove her to Jeffrey Epstein’s house, the address of which was given 
to her by Defendant. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 117:20-118:1. Ms. 
Giuffre was lead into the house, and was instructed by Defendant on how to give a massage, 
during which Epstein and Defendant turned the massage into a sexual encounter, and offered Ms. 
Giuffre money and a better life to be compliant in the sexual demands of Defendant and 
Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 198:20-199:3; 199:15-199:18. 
The minor Ms. Giuffre then began travelling with Defendant and Epstein on private planes and 
servicing people sexually for money—working not as a legitimate masseuse, but in a position of 
sexual servitude. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 5, 1, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 193:22-194:16; 
201:24; 204:24:205:5; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 104:9-104:14. 

Epstein’s house manager, Juan Alessi, described Defendant’s methodical routine of how 
she prepared a list of places ahead of time, then drove to each place for the purpose of recruiting 
girls to massage Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 18, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 34; 
GIUFFRE000105 at 57-58; GIUFFRE000241-242 at p. 212-213. Alessi also stated that on 


multiple occasions he drove Defendant to pre-planned places while she recruited girls for 


39 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page40 of 66 


massage. /d. He furthered testified that he witnessed Ms. Giuffre at Epstein’s house on the very 
same day that he witnessed Defendant recruit Ms. Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 18, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 96-98; GIUFFRE000102-103 at p. 48-49. 

Johanna Sjoberg, through her sworn testimony, demonstrated that Defendant recruited 
her in a similar fashion by driving to the college campus where she attended school and 
approached her to work at Epstein’s home answering phones. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, 
Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 8-9. Sjoberg testified that she answered phones for one day before 
Defendant propositioned her to rub feet for $100.00 an hour. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, 
Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 13. The following day, Sjoberg was paired with Defendant’s assistant, 
Emmy Taylor, who provided her with massage training on Epstein. Sjoberg at 13-15. Ms. 
Giuffre’s then-boyfriend, Austrich, testified that he could not recall the name of the person who 
recruited Ms. Giuffre. However, he did say that she was recruited by someone to work for 
Epstein as a massage therapist, but that Ms. Giuffre did not have any experience. See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 2, Austrich Dep. Tr. at 34-35, 100-101, 127-128. Neither Ms. Giuffre nor Sjoberg 
were licensed or trained in massage, but were invited soon after being recruited to travel with 
Epstein on his private plane to massage him. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16, Giuffre Dep. Tr. 
at 16-17; Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 13-15; Austrich Dep. Tr. at 109-110; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 104. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
42. Ms. Giuffre resumed her relationship with convicted felon Anthony Figueroa. In 

spring 2001, while living with Austrich, Ms. Giuffre lied to and cheated on him with her 

high school boyfriend, Anthony Figueroa. Ms. Giuffre and Austrich thereafter broke up, 
and Figueroa moved into the Bent Oak apartment with Ms. Giuffre. When Austrich 
returned to the Bent Oak apartment to check on his pets and retrieve his belongings, 

Figueroa in Ms. Giuffre’s presence punched Austrich in the face. Figueroa and Ms. 


Giuffre fled the scene before police arrived. Figueroa was then a convicted felon and a 
drug abuser on probation for possession of a controlled substance. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


40 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page41 of 66 


This entire statement is wholly irrelevant to the case being tried, and is improperly being 
inserted to tarnish the record. Ms. Giuffre’s dating history as a young teen bears no relation to 
the allegations made within Ms. Giuffre’s complaint against Defendant. As previously stated, 
Defendant is attempting to muddy the record with nonsensical teen drama in an effort to detract 
from her salacious sexual abuse of a minor child. Such statements bear no relation to the issues 
presented through her motion for summary judgment, and should be given weight reflecting the 
same. As specifically set forth in Ms. Giuffre’s objections to designated testimony, the alleged 
information would be excluded by multiple rules of evidence, and contested by Ms. Giuffre. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Virginia Dep. Tr., passim. Moreover, it was the Defendant who 
solicited Anthony Figueroa to recruit high school aged girls for Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at 
Exhibit 4 Figueroa Tr. at 200 and 228-229. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


43. Ms. Giuffre freely and voluntarily contacted the police to come to her aid in 2001 
and 2002 but never reported to them that she was Epstein’s “sex slave.” In August 
2001 at age 17, while living in the same apartment, Ms. Giuffre and Figueroa hosted a 
party with a number of guests. During the party, according to Ms. Giuffre, someone 
entered Ms. Giuffre’s room and stole $500 from her shirt pocket. Ms. Giuffre contacted 
the police. She met and spoke with police officers regarding the incident and filed a 
report. She did not disclose to the officer that she was a “sex slave.” A second time, in 
June 2002, Ms. Giuffre contacted the police to report that her former landlord had left her 
belongings by the roadside and had lit her mattress on fire. Again, Ms. Giuffre met and 
spoke with the law enforcement officers but did not complain that she was the victim of 
any sexual trafficking or abuse or that she was then being held as a “sex slave.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


This statement is misleading in several respects and irrelevant. The fact that Ms. Giuffre 
did contact police on two occasions for two specific purposes and did not take that opportunity to 
also inform the police of everything else that was going on in her life at the time is immaterial. 


Defendant implies that anytime someone calls the police for one thing they should tell the police 


41 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page42 of 66 


about every other crime regardless of the relevance to the crime to which the police responded 
and regardless to the threat to herself should she report on these powerful people. Moreover, as 
Professor Coonan explained: 


Popular understandings of the term “sex slave” might still connote images of violent 
pimps, white slavery, or of victims chained to a bed in a brothel in the minds of some 
people. To call Ms. Giuffre a victim of sex trafficking would however very accurately 
convey the reality that she along with a great many other victims of contemporary forms 
of slavery are often exploited by the “invisible chains” of fraud and psychological 
coercion. 


See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 23, Coonan Expert Report at 20. Ms. Giuffre specifically testified 

that she was fearful of Defendant and Epstein, and, accordingly, she would not have reporter her 

abusers. She also knew that Epstein had control over the Palm Beach Police. See McCawley Dec. 

at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 240:3-241:2. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

44. From August 2001 until September 2002, Epstein and Maxwell were almost entirely 
absent from Florida on documented travel unaccompanied by Ms. Giuffre. Flight 
logs maintained by Epstein’s private pilot Dave Rodgers evidence the substantial number 
of trips away from Florida that Epstein and Maxwell took, unaccompanied by Ms. 
Giuffre, between August 2001 and September 2002. Rodgers maintained a log of all 
flights on which Epstein and Maxwell traveled with him. Epstein additionally traveled 
with another pilot who did not keep such logs and he also occasionally traveled via 
commercial flights. For substantially all of thirteen months of the twenty-two months 
(from November 2000 until September 2002) that Ms. Giuffre lived in Palm Beach and 
knew Epstein, Epstein was traveling outside of Florida unaccompanied by Ms. Giuffre. 
During this same period of time, Ms. Giuffre was employed at various jobs, enrolled in 
school, and living with her boyfriend. 

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
The flight logs produced in this matter provide substantive evidence of Ms. Giuffre’s 

travel while in the control of Defendant and Epstein, but are clearly incomplete. Moreover, Ms. 

Giuffre also was flown by Defendant on commercial flights. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, 

Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 155:5-11. Ms. Giuffre disputes Defendant’s statement to the contrary, as 


reliance upon incomplete records to prove that Ms. Giuffre was not in fact in the presence of 


42 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page43 of 66 


Defendant and Epstein is insufficient. Ms. Giuffre incorporates additional details contained in 
Response #38 and #46 herein. 

Ms. Giuffre’s obvious gap in her school records, her presence verified by Epstein’s pilot 
on flight logs, and witness testimony, corroborate her story that she was traveling with Defendant 
and Epstein. In fact, flight logs and pilot testimony clearly prove that Ms. Giuffre was flying 
domestic and internationally with Epstein at least 32 times between 12/11/00-07/28/01 and 
06/21/02-08/21/02 (Defendant traveling with Ms. Giuffre on 23 of the flights). 

As Defendant acknowledges in her own statement #44, flight records are incomplete. 
There were several pilots and co-pilots that flew Epstein and Maxwell (Lawrence “Larry” 
Visoski, David (Dave) Rodgers, Bill Hammond, Pete Rathgeb, Gary Roxburgh, and Bill 
Murphy) in multiple aircrafts (JEGE, Inc. Aircraft # N908JE — Type B-727-31, and Hyperion 
Air, Inc. Aircraft # N909JE — Type G-1159B). Yet, only one pilot, David Rodger’s produced 
flight records. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 41, David Rodger’s Flight Log, 
GIUFFRE007055- GIUFFRE007161. In addition, many of the girls recruited by Defendant 
routinely traveled on commercial flights for the purposes of providing massages to Epstein or 
guests at Epstein’s New York, New Mexico, or U.S. Virgin Island homes. See McCawley Dec. 
at Exhibit 16, Sjoberg Dep. Tr. at 27. 

As thoroughly depicted below, Ms. Giuffre’s passport application, travel records and 
witness testimony clearly demonstrate flight logs are incomplete because only one pilot kept a 
log, and Ms. Giuffre also flew commercially while she worked for Defendant and Epstein. For 
example, on December 11, 2000, while underage, Ms. Giuffre appears on Rodger’s flight log 
(flight #1433) traveling with Epstein, Maxwell and Emmy Taylor from PBI (Palm Beach, FL) to 


TEB (Teterboro, NJ) then on December 14, 2001 (#1434) continues traveling with Epstein and 


4B 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page44 of 66 


Maxwell to TIST (U.S. Virgin Islands); however, there is no flight records of Ms. Giuffre’s 
return to Palm Beach. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 15, see McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 41, 
Rodger’s Dep. Ex. 1 at GIUFFRE007095; see also Rodger’s Dep. Tr. 96-98 (“Q: And do you 
know how Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Adam Perry Lang, and Virginia get off of St. 


Thomas or leave the island? A: No. I do not. Probably a charter, I'm guessing.”).

On January 12, 2001, at Defendant’s directive, Ms. Giuffre applied for a Passport to 
travel with them internationally. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 37, GIUFFRE004721, passport 
application listing travel plans to London; flight logs subsequently lists Ms. Giuffre traveling to 


London with Defendant, Epstein and others). 














On January 26, 2001, while underage, Ms. Giuffre appears on Rodger’s flight log (flight 
#1444) traveling with Epstein, Maxwell and Emmy Taylor from TEB (Teterboro, NJ) to PBI 
(Palm Beach, FL); however, there is no flight record indicating how Ms. Giuffre got to New 
York. On January 27, 2001 (#1445) continues traveling with Epstein, Maxwell and Emmy 


Taylor from PBI (Palm Beach) to TIST (U.S. Virgin Islands) returning from TIST (U.S. Virgin

On March 5, 2001 Ms. Giuffre, Maxwell, Epstein, Emmy Taylor traveled aaa: 


internationally (flight #1464) leaving PBI (West Palm Beach) to CYJT (Stephenville, Canada); 


then on March 6, 2001 (#1465) they continued on to LFPB (Paris, France) with a layover for

A few glaring examples of how Ms. Giuffre’s travel records are incomplete is that Ms. 
Giuffre traveled from ADS (Addison, Texas) on May 3, 2001 (#1501) to SAT (San Antonio, 
Texas); then departs SAT (San Antonio, Texas) on May 5, 2001 (#1502) to PBF (Pine Bluff, 
AR) but there is no record produced that explains how Ms. Giuffre arrived in Addison, Texas or 
how she returned to Palm Beach from Pine Bluff, AR. Although Epstein’s plane appears to have 
to originated from Palm Beach on April 23, 2001, Ms. Giuffre’s name doesn’t not appear on the 
log. See Rodger’s Dep. Ex. 1 at GIUFFRE007099; Rodger’s Dep. Tr. at 130-132 (“Q: Do you 
know how Virginia Roberts got to Addison, Texas? A: No. ... Q: Went to Addison and picked 
up Virginia Roberts? A: It looks like it.”). 

Another prime example of how incomplete Ms. Giuffre’s travel records are is on on May 
14, 2001. While Ms. Giuffre appears on flight #1506 with Epstein, Maxwell, Emmy Taylor and 
others (including one unidentified female) from TIST (U.S. Virgin Islands) to TEB (Teterboro, 
NJ), there is no record produced explaining how Ms. Giuffre arrived to the U.S. Virgin Islands or 
where she stayed when she landed in New York. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 15, Rodger’s 
Dep. Ex. 1 at GIUFFRE007100; Rodger’s Dep. Tr. at 132-133 (“Q: What were the other possible 
avenues back in those days for Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell to travel to the Virgin 
Islands? A: They could have done a charter, possibly.”) (/d. at 134-135 “Q: All right. So at some 
point in time, between May 7th and May 14th — A: Uh-huh. Q: -- somebody flies the Gulfstream

From September 29, 2002 through October 19, 2002, Defendant and Epstein sent Ms. 
Giuffre on a commercial flight to Thailand for massage training and provided her with all 
accommodations. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 43, Giuffre00741 1-Giuffre007432. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
45. Ms. Giuffre and Figueroa shared a vehicle during 2001 and 2002. Ms. Giuffre and 

Figueroa shared a ’93 white Pontiac in 2001 and 2002. Ms. Giuffre freely traveled around 

the Palm Beach area in that vehicle. In August 2002, Ms. Giuffre acquired a Dodge 

Dakota pickup truck from her father. Figueroa used that vehicle in a series of crimes 


before and after Ms. Giuffre left for Thailand. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Ms. Giuffre and Tony Figueroa did not share a vehicle during 2001 and 2002. Instead, 
Figueroa borrowed Ms. Giuffre’s car while she was traveling with Defendant and Epstein. 
Figueroa testified that he “got to take the car, because she was going somewhere else in the 
world and did not need it, so...” Figueroa Dep. Tr. At 89-90. 

In fact, Ms. Giuffre was frequently traveling with Defendant and Epstein. See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 1, Alessi Dep. Tr. at 9-14 (stating that Virginia started traveling on an airplane 
with Ghislaine and Jeffrey “not too long” after she started going over to the house). Figueroa 
further testified that Virginia “would normally go about two weeks out of every month” with 
Epstein. Figueroa Dep. Tr. at 90. He further stated, “Pretty much every time I took her there, it 
was always to his mansion. I picked her up one time -- maybe it was a couple of times --from 
the jet stream place. But pretty much every single time it was at the hou- -- at the mansion.” Jd. 
Moreover, Ms. Giuffre testified she purchased a car from the $10,000 payment she received from 
Epstein after she was forced to have sex with Prince Andres in London at Defendant’s home 


when Ms. Giuffre was a minor. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 120:1-20. 


51 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page52 of 66 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
46. Ms. Giuffre held a number of jobs in 2001 and 2002. During 2001 and 2002, Ms. 

Giuffre was gainfully employed at several jobs. She worked as a waitress at Mannino’s 

Restaurant, at TGIFriday’s restaurant (aka CCI of Royal Palm Inc.), and at Roadhouse 

Grill. She also was employed at Courtyard Animal Hospital (aka Marc Pinkwasser 

DVM). 

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

This statement is laughable. Ms. Giuffre was hardly gainfully employed during a time 
period in which she was trying to escape from the grip Epstein and Maxwell had on Ms. Giuffre. 
While Social Security provides that she earned nominal amounts of earning statements for 2001 
and 2002, the records do not indicate the month or quarter of the year’s work. See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 46, GIUFFRE009176. For a brief period, Ms. Giuffre attempted to go back to 
school to earn her GED, and tried unsuccessfully to hold down waitressing jobs. See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 27, GIUFFRE009179. 

For example, in 2001, Ms. Giuffre earned $212.00 as a waitress working “briefly” at 
Mannino’s Restaurant. (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 472). In 2002, Ms. 
Giuffre earned $403.64 at CCI of Royal Palm Beach working there (TGI Fridays) for a “short 
time period.” (See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 473). Then, Ms. Giuffre 


worked at Roadhouse grill until about March 2002 earning $1,247.90 (See McCawley Dec. at 


Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 474).

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page54 of 66 


to Thailand in September 2002 to receive formal training as a masseuse. Figueroa drove 
her to the airport. While there, she initially contacted Figueroa frequently, incurring a 
phone bill of $4,000. She met Robert Giuffre while in Thailand and decided to marry 
him. She thereafter ceased all contact with Figueroa from October 2002 until two days 
before Mr. Figueroa’s deposition in this matter in May 2016. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 
Ms. Giuffre did travel to Thailand to receive massage training in September 2002. 
However, Defendant has inaccurately told only part of the story. Defendant has conveniently left 
out certain key facts, which includes the fact that Ms. Giuffre was given an assignment from 
Defendant and Epstein that she had to recruit another underage girl from Thailand, and bring that 
young girl back to Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 43, GIUFFRE 003191. The 
document Ms. Giuffre was give directs her to “call Ms. Maxwell.” See McCawley Dec. at 
Exhibit 32, GIUFFRE003191. It is not disputed by Defendant or Epstein, that Ms. Giuffre was 
expected to return to Epstein and Maxwell upon completion of her massage training and 
assignment. It is undisputed by Ms. Giuffre that she did not return to Defendant and Epstein, but 
instead escaped clear across the world to Australia where she remained in hiding from Defendant 
and Epstein for several years. 
DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
48. Detective Recarey’s investigation of Epstein failed to uncover any evidence that Ms. 
Maxwell was involved in sexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or 
possession of child pornography. Joseph Recarey served as the lead detective from the 
Palm Beach Police Department charged with investigating Jeffrey Epstein. That 
investigation commenced in 2005. Recarey worked only on the Epstein case for an entire 
year. He reviewed previous officers’ reports and interviews, conducted numerous 
interviews of witnesses and alleged victims himself, reviewed surveillance footage of the 
Epstein home, participated in and had knowledge of the search warrant executed on the 
Epstein home, and testified regarding the case before the Florida state grand jury against 
Epstein. Detective Recarey’s investigation revealed that not one of the alleged Epstein 
victims ever mentioned Ms. Maxwell’s name and she was never considered a suspect by 
the government. None of Epstein’s alleged victims said they had seen Ms. Maxwell at 
Epstein’s house, nor said they had been “recruited by her,” nor paid any money by her, 


nor told what to wear or how to act by her. Indeed, none of Epstein’s alleged victims ever 
reported to the government they had met or spoken to Ms. Maxwell. Maxwell was not 


54 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page55 of 66 


seen coming or going from the house during the law enforcement surveillance of 
Epstein’s home. The arrest warrant did not mention Ms. Maxwell and her name was 
never mentioned before the grand jury. No property belonging to Maxwell, including 
“sex toys” or “child pornography,” was seized from Epstein’s home during execution of 
the search warrant. Detective Recarey, when asked to describe “everything that you 
believe you know about Ghislaine Maxwell’s sexual trafficking conduct,” replied, “I 
don’t.” He confirmed he has no knowledge about Ms. Maxwell sexually trafficking 
anybody. Detective Recarey also has no knowledge of Ms. Giuffre’s conduct that is 
subject of this lawsuit. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

This statement is false. Detective Recarey knew that Maxwell was involved in the illegal 
sexual activities at Epstein's house. He wanted to speak to her, but Maxwell did not return his 
calls. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 28:23-29:10. Detective Recarey 
concluded that Defendant’s role was to procure girls for Epstein. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 
13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 29:16-29:20. In the execution of the search warrant, stationary was 
found in the home bearing Maxwell's name, and notes were written by house staff to Maxwell. 
See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 45:13-25; Jd. at 83:3-83:15; see also 
Message Pads, GIUFFRE 001412, 001418, 001435, 001446, 001449, 001453, 001454. A key 
piece of evidence in the investigation were message pads uncovered in trash pulls, and from 
inside the residence during the search warrant. Those message pads revealed numerous calls left 
at the house for Maxwell, indicating she was staying in the house during the days when Epstein 


was engaging in illegal sex acts with minors. 


Additionally, a walk through video taken during the execution of the search warrant 
revealed photos of topless females at the home, and there was even a photograph of Maxwell 
naked hanging in the home. The house staff who were deposed in the civil cases each testified to 


Maxwell being the boss in charge of everyone in the house. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibits 1, 


55:

19, 21, Banasiak Dep. Tr. at 8:21-9:16; 14:20-15:6; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 23:11-23:20; Rodriguez 
Dep. Tr. at 169:1-169:4. 

Rodriguez, the house butler from 2004 through 2005, a time period that revealed daily 
sexual abuse of underage females, testified that Maxwell kept a list of the local girls who were 
giving massages at her desk, and that Maxwell kept nude photos of girls on her computer. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 238:4-238:22; 302:19-303:10; 306:1- 
306:24. Recarey testified that when the search warrant was executed, the house had been 
sanitized and the computers removed from the home. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, 
Recarey Dep. Tr. at 72:25-73:15. Banaziak testified that the computers were removed by 
Adriana Ross, another employee who answered to Maxwell. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 19, 
Banaziak Dep. Tr. at 54:7-22. 

The record is replete with testimony demonstrating that Maxwell recruited Virginia, and 
recruited other females, who in turn recruited other females, all who were sexually abuse by 
Epstein; meaning, it is undisputed that Maxwell started the top of the pyramid of local Palm 
Beach girls who were all eventually identified as victims. See, e.g., McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 1, 
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 34:19-35:3; 98:5-98:12; 104:15-104:23. The co-conspirator who maintained 
direct contact with the many underage victims was Sarah Kellen, whose sole responsibility was 
to schedule underage girls to visit Epstein for sex. Sarah reported directly to Maxwell. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez Dep. Tr. at 26:10-26:20. On the day when the search 
warrant was executed, the house maid, Ruboyo was scheduled to report to the house that day at 8 
am; however, she received a call from Maxwell telling her not to go. See McCawley Dec. at 


Exhibit 20, Rabuyo Dep. Tr. at 81:20-82:25. Maxwell orchestrated and ran the entire sex 


56 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page57 of 66 


trafficking scheme from a high level, and insulated herself from most of the underage girls who 
were being paid for sex. 

Tony Figueroa, Ms. Giuffre's ex-boyfriend, did testify that Maxwell personally requested 
that he find and bring girls to Epstein for sex once Ms. Giuffre had escaped, and that when he 
brought the girls Maxwell interacted with them. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 4, Figueroa Dep. 
Tr. at 200:6-18; 228:23-229:21. Rodriguez testified unequivocally that Maxwell was "the boss" 
and that she knew everything that was going on. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 21, Rodriguez 
Dep. Tr. 169:1-169:4. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
49. No nude photograph of Ms. Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home. Epstein’s 
housekeeper, Juan Alessi, “never saw any photographs of Virginia Roberts in Mr. 

Epstein’s house.” Detective Recarey entered Epstein’s home in 2002 to install security 


cameras to catch a thief and did not observe any “child pornography” within the home, 
including on Epstein’s desk in his office. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

This is false. Nude photographs were displayed throughout Epstein’s home. 
Furthermore, Alfredo Rodriguez testified to Maxwell having pornography on her computer. 
Rodriguez Dep. Tr. 150:10-17; 306:1-306:24. He also testified to there being a collage of nude 
photos in Epstein's closet. Jd. 253:14-254:18. That collage was eventually taken into evidence 
by Detective Recarey, who testified to that fact in his deposition. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 
13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 73:19-73:24. And those photos are still in the possession of the FBI or 
US Attorney's Office. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 13, Recarey Dep. Tr. at 74:2-74:7. 

Numerous other people have testified about nude photographs being on display in the 
home including Ronaldo Rizzo, who visited the home on numerous occasions and who was 
reprimanded by Maxwell herself for looking at the nude photos. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 


14, Rizzo Dep. Tr. at 25:19-26:20. Additionally, the search warrant video, taken at a time when 


57 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page58 of 66 


the house had already been sanitized, revealed photographs of nudity displayed, including a 
photograph of Maxwell herself in the nude. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 44, Search Warrant 
Video attached to the Deposition of Recarey. 

Johanna Sjorberg testified that the Defendant bought her a camera for the specific 
purpose of her taking nude photos of herself. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 16 Sjoberg Tr. at 
150. Finally, Virginia Giuffre testified that there was a nude photograph of her at the house. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5 Virginia Giuffre Tr. at 232 and 333. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

50. Ms. Giuffre intentionally destroyed her “journal” and “dream journal” regarding 
her “memories” of this case in 2013 while represented by counsel. Ms. Giuffre 
drafted a “journal” describing individuals to whom she claims she was sexually trafficked 
as well as her memories and thoughts about her experiences with Epstein. In 2013, she 
and her husband created a bonfire in her backyard in Florida and burned the journal 
together with other documents in her possession. Jd. Ms. Giuffre also kept a “dream 


journal” regarding her thoughts and memories that she possessed in January 2016. To 
date, Ms. Giuffre cannot locate the “dream journal.” 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


The dream journal contained memories of Ms. Giuffre’s dreams. While Ms. Giuffre has 
looked for this journal, which is wholly irrelevant to this case, she has been unable to locate it. 
Ms. Giuffre also wrote in a personal journal some of her experiences with Maxwell and Epstein, 
which were harmful and painful. In an effort to relieve herself of those past painful experiences, 
Ms. Giuffre followed the advice of a therapist, and burned the journal as a form of cathartic 
release at a time when she was under no obligation to maintain the personal memorialization of 
personal and painful experiences. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 205:13- 


206:10. 


58 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page59 of 66 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 

51. Ms. Giuffre publicly peddled her story beginning in 2011. Ms. Giuffre granted 
journalist Sharon Churcher extensive interviews that resulted in seven (7) widely 
distributed articles from March 2011 through January 2015. Churcher regularly 
communicated with Ms. Giuffre and her “attorneys or other agents” from “early 2011” to 
“the present day.” Ms. Giuffre received approximately $160,000 for her stories and 
pictures that were published by many news organizations. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 


Defendant's statement misrepresents history. In 2011, Ms. Giuffre was still in hiding 
from Epstein and Maxwell in Australia. Ms. Giuffre was not looking to sell anything or even 
speak with anyone about what had happened to her in her previous life from which she 
dramatically escaped. Journalist, Sharon Churcher, located Ms. Giuffre and impressed the 
importance of Ms. Giuffre standing up to those who had harmed her and speak with Federal 
authorities, which Ms. Giuffre did in 2011. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31, Redacted 302 


GIUFFRE001235-01246. 


In addition, Churcher impressed the importance of bringing the abuse of Defendant and 
Epstein to public light to prevent their continued abuse of others. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 
35, Giuffre003690. After much deliberation, Ms. Giuffre agreed to be interviewed by Churcher, 
and was compensated for sharing her story, which came at a heavy price of being publicly 
scrutinized. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
52. Ms. Giuffre drafted a 144-page purportedly autobiographical book manuscript in 

2011 which she actively sought to publish. In 2011, contemporaneous with her 

Churcher interviews, Ms. Giuffre drafted a book manuscript which purported to 

document Ms. Giuffre’s experiences as a teenager in Florida, including her interactions 

with Epstein and Maxwell. Ms. Giuffre communicated with literary agents, ghost writers 
and potential independent publishers in an effort to get her book published. She 


generated marketing materials and circulated those along with book chapters to numerous 
individuals associated with publishing and the media.

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page60 of 66 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATE 





'T CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

Defendant’s characterization of these activities are out of context and thus misleading. In 
2008, Ms. Giuffre received a Victim Notification Letter from the United States Attorney’s office 
for the Southern District of Florida, see McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 30, GIUFFRE0010202, 
regarding her sexual victimization by Epstein. Thereafter, in 2011, she sought psychological 
counseling from a psychologist for the trauma she endured. Also that year, journalist Sharon 
Churcher sought her out, and traveled half way around the globe to interview her on painful 
subjects. Ms. Giuffre was interviewed by the FBI in 2011. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 31, 
FBI Redacted 302 GIUFFRE01235-1246. She was also getting psychological help. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 38, Lightfoot Records, GIUFFRE00543 1-005438. In that situation, 
Ms. Giuffre began to draft a fictionalized account of what happened to her. It was against this 
backdrop of her trauma being unearthed, her steps to seek psychological counseling for it, that 
she drafted this manuscript. Doing so was an act of empowerment and a way of reframing and 
taking control over the narrative of her past abuse that haunts her. 

“Writing ‘I’ has been an emancipatory project for women.” Perreault, Jeanne, 
“AUTOGRAPHY/ TRANSFORMATION/ ASYMMETRY,” Women, Autobiography, Theory A Reader 
edited by Sidonie Smith & Julia Watson. Indeed, scholars have written that the act of engaging in 
autobiography or even accounts loosely based on autobiography, is a process of taking control of 
one’s own narrative and one’s own self: “Thus a specific recitation of identity involves the 
inclusion of certain identity contents and the exclusion of others; the incorporation of certain 
narrative itineraries and internationalities, the silencing of others; the adoption of certain 


autobiographical voices, the muting of others.” Smith, Sidonie, PERFORMATIVITY,

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PRACTICE, RESISTANCE, Women, Autobiography, Theory A Reader edited by 
Sidonie Smith & Julia Watson. 

Indeed, even a cursory look at the manuscript penned by Ms. Giuffre informs the reader 
that she is trying to put forth a more palatable and more empowering narrative to over-write that 
powerlessness she felt when being abused by Defendant and Epstein. While Ms. Giuffre 
explored trying to publish her story to empower other individuals who were subject to abuse, she 
ultimately decided not to publish it. See McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. 249:16- 
18; 250:19-251:3. 

DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 
53. Ms. Giuffre’s publicly filed “lurid” CVRA pleadings initiated a media frenzy and 
generated highly publicized litigation between her lawyers and Alan Dershowitz. On 

December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre, through counsel, publicly filed a joinder motion that 

contained her “lurid allegations” about Ms. Maxwell and many others, including Alan 

Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, Jean-Luc Brunel. The joinder motion was followed by a 

“corrected” motion and two further declarations in January and February 2015, which 

repeated many of Ms. Giuffre’s claims. These CVRA pleadings generated a media 

maelstrom and spawned highly publicized litigation between Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers, 

Edwards and Cassell, and Alan Dershowitz. After Ms. Giuffre publicly alleged Mr. 

Dershowitz of sexual misconduct, Mr. Dershowitz vigorously defended himself in the 

media. He called Ms. Giuffre a liar and accused her lawyers of unethical conduct. In 

response, attorneys Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz who counterclaimed. This 
litigation, in turn, caused additional media attention by national and international media 
organizations. 

MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 

See Ms. Giuffre’s Paragraph 7, supra, explaining why the allegations were necessary and 
appropriate for multiple reasons. Ms. Giuffre disputes Defendant’s false characterization of these 


events, and, indeed, the media attention was caused by Defendant’s is suing her defamatory press 


release.

Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page62 of 66 


DEFENDANT’S PURPORTED FACTS 


54. Ms. Giuffre formed non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to attract publicity and speak 
out on a public controversy. In 2014, Ms. Giuffre, with the assistance of the same 
counsel, formed a non-profit organization, Victims Refuse Silence. According to Ms. 
Giuffre, the purpose of the organization is to promote Ms. Giuffre’s professed cause 
against sex slavery. The stated goal of her organization is to help survivors surmount the 
shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse. Ms. 
Giuffre attempts to promote Victims Refuse Silence at every opportunity. For example, 
Ms. Giuffre participated in an interview in New York with ABC to promote the charity 
and to get her mission out to the public. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT CONTROVERTING DEFENDANT’S FACTS 





Ms. Giuffre did not form the non-profit Victims Refuse Silence to "speak out on a public 
controversy," but instead to simply help survivors of sexual abuse and sexual trafficking. In 
order to provide assistance to victims, Ms. Giuffre attempted to talk about the non-profit’s 


mission when she had the opportunity to do so. See www.victimsrefusesilece.org. 


MS. GIUFFRE’S STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS

116:19-117:12; Alessi Dep. Tr. at 94:24-95:2; Sky Roberts Dep. Tr. at 80:7-19; 84:18 -85:1. 

63. At the time Maxwell recruited Virginia to Jeffrey Epstein's house, Virginia was 
either 16 or 17 years old, depending on whether this occurred just before or just after Virginia's

63 


Case 18-2868, Document 281, 08/09/2019, 2628234, Page64 of 66 


67. Epstein and Maxwell turned the massage into a sexual encounter. See McCawley 
Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 198:20-199:3; 199:15-199:18. 

68. Virginia was not a professional masseuse, and was not old enough to be a 
masseuse in Florida even though Maxwell testified she only hired professional masseuses. See 
McCawley Dec. at Exhibit 5, Giuffre Dep. Tr. at 61:9-61:24, 111:12-111:21, 116:19-117:12; Fla.

3 Q. Okay. And who would find the massage 
4 therapist to bring to the house? 
3 A. They would call me in my office, and they 
6 would say, Get me a massage at 10:00 with this 
7 person. 
8 I have a list of the massage therapists, a 


9 Rolodex, or a card, and I would call them for the 


10 specific time they want a massage. And I would do 
1: that. 

12 O I don't think I asked the right -- the 
13 question that I was looking to ask, so let me go 
14 back. 

15 Did you go out looking for the girls -- 
16 A. No. 

Hr Q. -- to bring --

20 A. Never. 

21 Q. Who did? 

22 A. Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Epstein and their 

23 friends, because their friends relayed to other 


24 friends they knew a massage therapist and they would 


25 send to the house. So it was referrals.

2 foundation. Hold on. That misstates what is 
3 happening in this deposition, because the word 
4 "recruit" was introduced by the lawyers in this 
3 deposition. So I object to your 
6 characterization of the testimony. 
7 BY MR. EDWARDS: 
8 Q. I'll read for you the question and the 
9 answer. 
10 The question was: "QUESTION: When did 


1 that role get transferred from you to Ms. Maxwell, 
12 the role of looking after girls or calling the 


13 girls? 


14 "ANSWER: I didn't look after -- out for 
15 girls. Ms. Maxwell was the one that recruit. I 

16 remember one occasion or two occasions she would say 
17 to me, John, give me a list of all the spas in Palm 


18 Beach County, and I will drive her from one to the 


19 other to PGA in Boca; and she would go in and drop 


20 credit cards -- not credit cards but business cards 

21 and she would come out. And then we'd go to -- she 

22 will recruit the girls. Was never, never done by me 
23 or Mr. Epstein or anyone else that I know of." 

24 Is that truthful testimony? 

25) A. It is truthful; however, I think

2 "recruiting," for myself, for my point of view, is 
3 hiring immediately and recruit the person. 
4 I think she was looking for massage 


3 therapists. She was looking for the best kind. She 


6 went -- and you're right, I went one time with her, 
I or twice maybe, to different spas and different 

8 clubs, great clubs, I mean, in Boca, in Fort 

9 Lauderdale, in -- in Palm Beach. She was looking 


10 for the best massage therapists available. 


11 How she find these girls, I don't know. I 
12 just drove there. I just was the driver. I never 
13 was involved with any of the offerings or 

14 negotiations or meeting these girls. Never. 

15 Q. Okay. Ms. Maxwell was the one that would 


16 meet the girls? 

17 A. Yeah. 

18 Q. Okay. Did you ever check any of the IDs 
19 for any of these girls? 

20 A. I was not -- that was not in my everyday 


21 things to do. It was not. 


22 Q. That was just not part of your job? 

23 A. That was not my job. 

24 Q. Did Ms. Maxwell take photographs while she 
25 was at the Palm Beach house?

6 A. I could not hear what they were saying, 

7 but I did see it. 

8 Q. Did you park the car or did you stop right 
9 there and --

12 A. Never. Never. 

13 Q. Okay. Did Ms. Maxwell tell you that 

14 Virginia's father worked at the Mar-a-Lago?

16 think we find out later, after the -- she says, My 
17 father works -- I think it was from Virginia, that 


18 she says her father works at Mar-a-Lago. 

19 It is information from her. I don't think 
20 it was Ms. Maxwell that told me anything. She don't 
Al. have to -- she don't have to talk to me. I mean, 

22 Ms. Maxwell will not go and talk to me about this -- 
23 these people's family. I don't know. She never

A I know when I first started there, they were 


corporate, but then they were a franchise. They were 
bought out. But I'm not sure if when I got there they 
were a franchise or not. 

Q Got it. 

Do you know if Ms. Roberts had any previous 
employment before she worked at Taco Bell? 

A I think by the apartment, she worked for KFC for 
a little while. 

MS. MENNINGER: Are you looking at Ms. 

Roberts? 

THE WITNESS: I'm thinking. I can't 

remember. I remember something with KFC. They 

had one really close to us. I think she worked 

there for a tiny, tiny bit. I'm not sure. 

MS. MENNINGER: Okay. 
BY MS. MENNINGER: 

Q Before the Taco Bell? 

A Or she could've applied there. It's just in my 
head. She might have just applied there, and didn't get 
it, and that's why I brought her to Taco Bell. 

Q Okay. 


A Because we were both the night managers.

No. 

Do you know about what years this was? 
Not really. 

Do you know about how old you were? 
When, what? 


I'm just focused on the period of time in which 


you were living at her parent's house in the trailer. 


A I was probably 18 when we moved in there. 

Q And you said you were only there for a couple of 
months? 

A Not that I remember. Like, it might have been a 
little longer. I'm not sure. 

Q Were you engaged to Ms. Roberts? 

A Yes. 

Q When did you become engaged to her? 

A When we were living in Oakland Park. 

Q Tell me about the engagement. How did it come 
about? 

A Well, we fell in love, and -- I believe it was 


Valentine's Day when I proposed. 


Q

Did you have a ring? 
Yes. 

Did she accept? 

Yes.

A Yes -- well, for a while. I mean, I know at the 
end, I wasn't working anywhere. 

Q Why weren't you working? 

A I don't remember the exact reason. 

Qo Had you quit? 

A I believe so. I know the pet store let me go 
for walking on to the other side talking to somebody. But 


I don't remember why I left Dunkin' Donuts. 


Q Do you believe that you were fired from Dunkin' 
Donuts? 
A No. That pet store was the only time anybody 


ever fired me. 


Q That will stick in your brain. 
A Yeah. 
Q At the time that you left the pet store, was 


Ms. Roberts still working there? 


A Yes. 

Q And how long do you recall her working there? 
A Not long. 

Q I hate to do this to you, but what does "not 


long" mean to you, weeks, months, days? 

A Over a month. That's really all I can say. 
Maybe over a month before she went to work at the 
Mar-a-Lago or Donald Trump's country club.

Q Did you know her friend by the name of Tony 
Figueroa? 

A Somewhat. 

QO Tell me what you remember about Tony Figueroa. 

A Other than him being an idiot, not much. 

QO Did you have any interactions with Mr. Figueroa? 


A Very little. 
Q When do you recall seeing him, like, in what 


city, I mean? 


A Up in West Palm Beach. 

Q Did he come over to your apartment? 

A I believe so. 

Q Did you believe them to be having a 
relationship? 

A At the very end when I left, yes. 

Q Was that one of the reasons for your leaving? 

A One of them. 

Q What were the others? 

A Well, after I found out about that, that's when 


I heard about all the other stuff that was happening. 

Q What did you hear about all the other stuff? 

A Well, I mean, after she went to work for 
Mar-a-Lago then she was, I guess, recruited to go work for 


Jeff something. I don't remember his last name.

Q Is that what she told you "she was recruited"? 
A Yeah. Well, she didn't use those words. But I 
don't know why else anybody would take -- like, they hired 


her over there as a massage therapist, but she didn't have 
any experience. 

Q At Mar-a-Lago -- 

A At Mar-a-Lago, yes. Then all of a sudden one 
day, she was working for Jeff, whatever his name was. 

Q Let me just take a step back. You found out 
towards the end of your relationship with Ms. Roberts that 
she was then having a relationship with Mr. Figueroa. Is 
that right? 

A I don't know if it was a relationship. But, 
yes. 

Q Enough to cause you to think you didn't want to 


be engaged anymore? 


A Yes. 

Q Did you and Ms. Roberts have a fight at that 
time? 

A Yes. 

Q What do you remember about the fight? What do 


you recall? 
A I don't recall. I remember us having a fight 
and then leaving not too long afterwards. 


Qo You referred to finding out all this other stuff

how long we lived there. 

Q Okay. At some point in time, though, while 
you're living on her parent's property, it becomes 1999? 

A Yeah, I believe. 

QO Okay. And so when you started living at her 
parent's property, you're 18, she's 15, but at some point 
in time you turn 19 and she turned 16? 

A Yes. 

Q Okay. And at some other point in time, she 


leaves the job at the pet store? 


A Pet store, yeah. 

Q And goes to work at the Mar-a-Lago? 

A Yes. At Donald Trump's country club, yeah.

A But if she had to get clean for her job, she 
would have gotten clean for the job. 

Q Okay. Do you remember her being hired as a 
bathroom attendant there, a locker room attendant? 

A Now that you're saying that, some kind of 
attendant sounds familiar. But I don't really remember. 
All I remember is for the massage. As a -- I don't 
remember exactly what she got hired for at Donald Trump's 
place. But I just remember the masseuse thing. 

But as you're saying "the attendant," the 
attendant sounds familiar because I doubt her father would 
hire her as a massage therapist without knowing anything. 

Q So you had known her for some period of time 


before she gets this job at the Mar-a-Lago, right? 


A Right. 

Q Did she have any massage therapy training 
whatsoever? 

A No. 

Q Ever given a massage to anyone? 

A Not that I remember. 

Q Ever given a massage to you? 

A Not until she was already doing the massage 


stuff. But, no, I don't remember any kind of massage 
training or even like an inkling for it. 


Q Okay. Then when she goes to work for

Q Okay. And is there anything that would tell you

world that would remind you right now?

Virginia have any massage experience?

dropped her off and somebody always brought her back. I 
don't really remember picking her up too much. 
Q Okay. And in the beginning, she was telling you 


that she was performing massages?

Q Do you remember her coming home and saying "I 
got a job with Jeff"? 

A I remember she said she got a job with Jeff. 

Q Did she tell about that job? 

A I think it was -- I think at the time it was for 
massage therapy, like, she was going to be a masseuse. 

Q And she was excited about it? 

A Yeah. 

Q She wasn't sad about it?

remember much from back then.

just got a job with Jeff," right?

Jeff before you moved into the Bent Oak apartment, but you 
don't know. Correct?

THE WITNESS: YeS- But I would think we 
would have had to have had the money by then. So 


that was the only time she was making real good 


money.

Q And do you know how much that apartment cost? 


A I know it was expensive.

Q Right? 

A Yeah. 

Q And she travelled the world? 

A Uh-huh (affirmative). Yes. 

Q Did JJ say there was anything weird about 
her job? 

A No. 

MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 

BY MS. MENNINGER: 

Q Did you know whether she had any massage 
training? 

A I did not. Like I said, the past three -- 


three or four years before then, I had no contact 
with her whatsoever. So I had no clue what she was 
certified in or had done with her life. 
Q Okay. I would like to take about a five-

certain times and stuff. And it would just -- you 
know, it just did not make sense to me that it it 
was just a masseuse, you know. Like I said, he's a 


billionaire. You can afford another masseuse. Why 
do you need her, you know. 

Q Do you know whether he -- 

(Brief interruption.) 

A Let me turn this down. 

Qo Sorry. 

A I'm sorry. 

(Briefly off the record.) 

Q Do you know whether he had other masseuses 
at the time? 

A I -- I really don't know. All I know is 
he would have Virginia, obviously, go out and look 
for other girls, also, to bring back, as well. 

QO And how do you know that? 

A Because she had explained to me that 
sometimes when she would go out on trips that her 
and Ms. Maxwell and stuff would go out to, like, 
clubs and stuff and just try and pick up girls to 


bring back, so... 


Q That's what Virginia told you? 
A Yes. 
Q All right. Did any of your information --

(Brief interruption.) 
A I thought I muted it. 
Q Did any of your information come from 
anywhere other than Virginia? 
A No. 
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 
A Like I said, I did not talk -—- I did not 


really speak to any of them other than, you know, 
hi, how's it going and stuff like that, until I had 
actually met Jeffrey. And then he was the only one 
I ever really spoke with. I had met Ms. Maxwell a 
couple of times, but it was never, like, you know, 
actual conversations, so... 
BY MS. MENNINGER: 

Q All right. Well, let me -- when did you 
meet Jeffrey? 

A I'd probably say -- probably a few months 


after I had moved in with her. 


Q Okay. And how did you come to meet 
Jeffrey? 

A Dropping her off over at his mansion. 

Q And did you drop her off using her car? 

A Yes. 

Qo And so she just asked you: Can you take 


me over there?

A Yeah. 

Q And did she tell you where to go? 

A Yeah. She told where he lived and 
everything. And then obviously I got to take the 
car, because she was going somewhere else in the 
world and did not need it, so... 

Q You were dropping her off for a multi-day 
trip? 

A Yeah. She would normally go about two 
weeks out of every month, so... 

Q Two weeks straight? 

A Yeah. It was two weeks home and two weeks 
gone, basically. 

Q Did you always take her to his house, 
OKs as 

A Yeah. Pretty much every time I took her 
there, it was always to his mansion. I picked her 
up one time -- maybe it was a couple of times -- 
from the jet stream place. But pretty much every 
single time it was at the hou- -- at the mansion. 

(Brief interruption.) 

Q Okay. So you're -- is that your phone? 
I'm -- 

A No, it is. I thought I muted it.

talking like that, so... 

Q Okay. Where did your first conversation 
with Jeffrey take place? 

A I'm pretty sure it was in the kitchen or 
the living room. 

Q Inside the house? 

A Yeah, it was inside the house. I've never 


seen him anywhere else other than in the mansion or 


getting off the jet. 


QO So you were allowed to go inside the 
house -- 

A Yeah. 

Q -- with Ms. Roberts? 

A Yeah. But I never went upstairs. I've 


only been in the kitchen, the living room, and by 
the pool. 

Q How many times would you estimate that you 
had been over to the house? 

A I mean, at least once every two weeks to 
drop her off, you know. 

Q Was there a period of time between 2001 
and when she left in 2002 where she was not working 
for Jeffrey? 

A Yes. 


Q What period of time was that?

A It was pretty much, like, when she was 
actually working as a server. Like, basically 
because we were trying to not have her go back 
there. Like, she did not want to go back there. 
And we were trying to just work without needing his 
money, you know. 

Q All right. And if I can re-call up that 
Exhibit 2, can you see from here when about she was 
working as a server? 


A March 4th, '02. 


Q Do you know about how long she worked 
there? 

A I do not. I'm not sure. 

Q Days? Weeks? Months? Anything? 

A I really have no clue. 

Q Okay. How old was Ms. Roberts in 2002, if 


you know? 

A I'd probably say, like, 18 or so, maybe. 

Q If her birthday is in '83 -- 

A Oh, if it's in '83, then I'd say -- 
because I was born in '82, so a year younger than me 
would be... 

Q 18, 19? 

A Yeah, somewhere around there.

Q I guess my question is: Did she ever tell 
you that she had started as a regular masseuse for 
him and then transitioned to something other than a 
masseuse? 

A No. She never said that it transitioned. 
But she ended up explaining to me what had happened 
before, so... 

QO What has —- what is that? 

A That her and Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey would 
obviously be doing stuff, all three of them 
together. Like I said, that they would all go out 
to clubs to pick up girls and try and find them to 
bring back for Jeffrey. And then she told me about 
how, like I said, her and Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey 
were all intimate together on multiple occasions. 


Qo When did she tell you this? 


A I'm not exactly sure on the dates. 

Q Was it while you were still together? 

A Yes. 

Q Did you -- had you met Ms. Maxwell? 

A Yeah, I had met her a couple of times. 

QO When did you meet Ms. Maxwell? 

A Dates, I'm unsure of. But it was pretty 


much, like I said, at Jeffrey's house in the 


kitchen.

Q Was it earlier in the time you were with 
her, or.. 
A It was about -- I'd say about six months 
or so. I don't know. I'm not exactly positive. 
Q All right. So at the time you met 


Ms. Maxwell, had Ms. Roberts already told you that 
she had been intimate? 

A No. She had told me about that, I 
believe, after I had max- -- after I had already met 
her. 

Q Okay. And tell me everything that you 
remember about what Ms. Roberts said about being 
intimate with Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein at the 
same time. 

A I remember her talking about, like, 
strap-ons and stuff like that. But, I mean, like I 
said, all the details are not really that clear. 
But I remember her talking about, like, how they 
would always be using and stuff like that. 

Q She and Ms. Maxwell and Mr Epstein would 
used strap-ons? 

A Uh-huh (affirmative). 

Q How did you feel about that? 

A I just -- obviously not happy about it.

A I did not. 

Q When the FBI interviewed you, did you 
mention this to them? 

A I mentioned -- anything they asked me, I 
did not hold anything back. 

Q Okay. Do you recall specifically talking 
about sex with the Prince? 

A I -- I don't recall talking to them about 
that, but, I mean, it's -- it could be possible. 

Q Other than sex with the Prince, is there 


anyone else that Jeffrey wanted Ms. Roberts to have 
sex with that she relayed to you? 

A Mainly, like I said, just Ms. Maxwell and 
all the other girls. 

Q Ms. Maxwell wanted -- Jeffrey wanted 
Virginia to have sex with Ms. Maxwell? 

A And him, yeah. 

Qo And did she tell you whether she had ever 
done that? 

A Yeah. She said that she did. 

Qo And when did she tell you that? 

A I'm not sure on the date. 

Q And what did she describe having happened? 

A I believe I already told you that. With 


the strap-ons and dildos and everything.

Virginia telling you that? 

A And JJ and Michael. 

Q Okay. So you had heard from some other 
people, and then later -- 

A Yeah. Before she had come back to the 
apartment, they said that she was a masseuse for 
this guy. And then when she came back, she told me.

again -- I'm sorry.

went with Virginia, and you dropped her off; and 
some occasions you went inside? 

A Yeah. 

Q And some of the occasions you went inside, 


you hung out by the pool? 


A Yes. 

Q Or in the kitchen with the chef? 

A Yeah. 

Q All right. And in the total of all the 


times that you went inside the house, you saw 


Ms. Maxwell -- I think you got up to six times? 
A Yeah, about five or six times. 
Q All right. Total? 
A Total. 
QO That's not five or six times where -- 
A That was period, all together. 
Q -- you brought girls? 
A No. All together, period. 


Q All right. I thought you said when I was 
asking you questions that Ms. Maxwell never asked 
you to bring girls. 

A I don't remember saying that. 

Qo Okay. Well, tell me. When did 
Ms. Maxwell ask you to bring a girl? 


A Never in person. It was, like, literally,

like, on the phone maybe, like, once or twice. 

Q All right. Did Ms. Maxwell call you 
frequently? 

A No. 

Q All right. How many times do you think 
Ms. Maxwell called you, at all? 

A I'd just say that probably a just a few, a 
couple of times. Maybe once or twice. 

Q One or two -— 

A The majority of the time it was pretty 


much his assistant. 


Q How do you know Ms. Maxwell's voice? 
A Because she sounds British. 
Q So someone with a British accent called 


you once or twice and asked for -- 

A Well, she told me who she was. 

Qo Okay. And what did she say when she 
called you and asked you to bring girls? 

A She just said, "Hi. This is Ghislaine. 
Jeffrey was wondering if you had anybody that could 


come over." 


Q Okay. When did that happen? 

A I'm not exactly sure on the time frame. 

Q Was it after the Roadhouse Grill or 
before?

Q So the thing that Virginia was tired of -- 
just so that the record is clear -- well, I'll let 
you answer in your words. Just be clear. 

What was it that Virginia was trying to 
get away from and stop with respect to working at 
Jeffrey Epstein's house? 

MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Form, 
foundation -- as to Virginia's thought 
processes. 

A To stop being used and abused. 

BY MS. MENNINGER: 
Q How do you know that? 


MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Form. 


Foundation. 
A Due to all the things that I have come 
to -- that have been brought to light, and in the 


experiences that I've had, and the conversations 
that I have had with her. Like, it just all adds up 
to: that; so... 

BY MS. MENNINGER: 

Q When Virginia was wanting to get out, did 
she ever express that it was the times of work that 
she was trying to get away from? 

A No. 


Q Okay. What was she specifically

Q Was she getting paid as much as she was 
getting paid to work for Jeff Epstein? 

A Definitely not. 

Q She no longer had cash all around? 

A Nope. 

Q You mentioned that there was -- you had 
several conversations with Virginia when she was 
discussing them wanting -- or I think the word you 


used was force, but later we tried to clarify that, 
but them forcing her to have sex with Prince Andrew. 
Do you remember that? 

A Yeah. 

Q And that you expressed that you were 
worried for her safety if she were to decline that? 

A Yes. 

QO What about your conversation with Virginia 
on that particular occasion made you worried for 
Virginia's safety? 

A Just the way she was talking to me. Like, 
she just sounded scared. 

Q And what -- what -- try to dig back and 
remember what exactly she was saying and how she was 
saying it, if you could just describe that for us. 

A She said that she went to go in -- I 


remember at one time she was talking to me about how

you don't. 

Do you have any reason to believe that any 
of your previous sworn statements that you have made 
are not true? 

A No. 

MR. EDWARDS: I just object and ask that 
if we're going to ask the witness questions about any 
of her statements in whole or in part that the 
witness be allowed to see the statement, review the 


statement and then answer your questions. 


Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) You may answer the 
question. 

A Can you reask the question? I'm sorry. 

Q Do you have any reason to believe that any 


of your prior sworn statements are untrue? 

A I have no reason to believe that my prior 
statements are untrue. 

Q Has anyone told you to say something that 
was not true in connection with this case? 

A No, ma'am. 

Q All right. I'd like to start witha 
lawsuit that you filed under the caption Jane Doe 
versus Jeffrey Epstein. 

Do you recall that lawsuit? 

A I believe so.

(Exhibit 1 marked.) 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) I'm going to show you 
an exhibit that we are marking as Defendant's 
Exhibit 1. 

MR. EDWARDS: Can I see that for a second? 

I'd just like to make an objection on the 
record for the misidentification of this document. 

While there was a lawsuit filed under the 
style of Jane Doe versus Jeffrey Epstein, Jane Doe 
was not Virginia Giuffre. And the lawsuit that's now 
being handed to this witness is Jane Doe 102 versus 
Jeffrey Epstein. 

Is that the document we're talking about? 

MS. MENNINGER: Counsel, if you have an 
objection, you should state the basis for your 
objection in a non-leading, non-suggestive manner. 

If you have any other record to make, you 
can do so in a pleading filed with the Court. 

MR. EDWARDS: Sure. My objection is 
you've misrepresented what you've handed the witness. 
I want to make sure that the witness is holding what 
you actually want her to be holding as opposed to the 
lawsuit you said that you were going to hand her. 

That's it. 

MS. MENNINGER: Counsel, I will ask the

January 19th, 2015? 
A At the very top of the page it says 
January 21st, 2015. 
Q The date it was filed. Is there a date 


just above the signature block? 


A Oh, yes, sorry. Yes, there is. 

Q And what date -- what date was that? 

A The 19th day of January, 2015. 

Q Okay. And this document is something that 


you believe contains the truth, correct? 

A To the best of my knowledge at the time, 
yes. 

Q All right. Did something change between 
the time then and today that makes you believe that 
it's not all accurate? 

A Well, as you can see, in line 4 on page 1, 
I wasn't aware of my dates. I was just doing the 
best to guesstimate when I actually met them. 

Since then I've been able to find out that 
through my Mar-a-Lago records that it was actually 


the summer of 2000, not the summer of 1999. 


Q Oh, I'm sorry. Are you back on page 1? 
A On the first page.

MR. EDWARDS: Objection. Asked and 


answered. 
Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) You may answer. 
MR. EDWARDS: Answer again. 
A Again, I wouldn't say it's untrue. Untrue 


would mean that I would have lied. And I didn't lie. 
This was my best knowledge at the time. And I did my 
very best to try to pinpoint time periods going back 

such a long time ago. 

It wasn't until I found the facts that I 
worked at Mar-a-Lago in 2000 that I was able to 
figure that out. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) And approximately when 
did you learn those facts about the dates you worked 
at Mar-a-Lago? 

A I would say it was mid-2015. 

Q Mid-2015 is the first time you became 


aware of the dates -- 


A I don't know the exact -- 

Q If you could just let me finish. 

A I'm sorry. 

Q That's all right. Approximately mid-2015 


when you learned the true dates that you had worked 
at Mar-a-Lago? 
A That's correct. Sorry.

MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 

A Uhm, I don't know, to be honest. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) And in what order did 
Taco Bell, Publix and Mar-a-Lago go, and the aviary, 
sorry? 

A Oh, I would have to guess. Do you want me 
to guess? 

Q Sure. 

A Um, I would say Publix. And then, I think 
that's when I helped my boyfriend out at Taco Bell 


and then I think the aviary. 


Q And where was the Taco Bell? 
A I was living in Fort Lauder -- I think it 
was Fort Lauderdale. Don't quote me on that, but 


somewhere in Florida, Broward County, something like 


that. 
Q And who were you living with at that time? 
A Michael. His name is James, but Michael. 
Q So you were living with Michael when you 


worked at the Taco Bell, right? 

A Yes, I was living with him. 

Q And you worked with Michael when you 
worked at the Publix, correct? 

A No. 

Q Okay. So Publix came after Taco Bell or

Q Whatever address you were living at, at 
the time you started at Mar-a-Lago. 

A Hn LOxehatchee, Florida 
33470. 

Q How is it that you came to work at 
Mar-a-Lago? 

A My dad is a maintenance manager or 
supervisor, I don't know what you call it. But he 
worked in the maintenance department, mostly on 
tennis courts, working on the air conditioning, 


helping set up for functions. And he got me a summer 


job there. 
Q Okay. And you said you were on a break? 
A Yes. 
Q What were you on a break from? 
A I think like -- this is going back so long 


now, but I was attempting to get my GED. And it, 
summer came, so school stops during the summertime 


here in America, and I got a summer job. 


Q All right. And where were you in school? 

A I don't actually know the name of the 
place. It's -- yeah, I know. 

Q A GED place? 

A Yeah, it was, like, I was previously in 


Royal Palm Beach High School, but, I mean, because of

to Defendant's Exhibit 12 at page 15. And under the 
heading Response to Interrogatory Number 9, do you 
see that where it says -- 

A Yes. 

Q -- Ms. Joffrey (pronouncing) -- Giuffre, 
excuse me, responds as follows? 

A Yes. 

Q Okay. It says you worked as a locker room 
attendant for the spa area, correct? 

A Yes. 

Q And it says records produced in this case 
identify the date of employment as 2000, correct? 

A Yes. 

Q What records that were produced in this 
case cause you to believe that the employment began 
in 2000? 

A Uhm, is this going back to another 
question that I'm not allowed to answer? 

Q No. 

A I have seen the documents, and I know that 
my employment now was in 2000. 

Q What documents did you see that caused you 
to make that answer? 

A The Mar-a-Lago employment documents.

Q What did the masseuses' uniform look like? 
A I don't remember. 

Q No recollection at all? 

A None whatsoever. 

Q Color? 

A No, sorry. I remember mine. 

Q Okay. How did it come to pass that you 


were no longer working at Mar-a-Lago in two to three 


weeks? 
A I was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell. 
Q Okay. And how long had you been working 


at Mar-a-Lago when you were approached by Ghislaine 


Maxwell? 
A Roughly two to three weeks. 
Q Okay. Where in the spa were you when you 


were approached by Ghislaine Maxwell? 

A Just outside the locker room, sitting 
where the other girl that works there usually sits. 
She was away from the desk. I was reading a book on 


massage therapy. 


Q Was that indoors or outdoors? 
A Outdoors.

locker room attendant one day. And. Yeah. 

Q What was the name of the massage therapist 
that you were speaking with? 

A Oh, I have no idea. 

Q Can you give me any physical description 
of any of them? 

A Um, there was one who had blonde short 
hair. There was -- I would say there's probably 
about four massage therapists that work in there. 
So, I mean, I don't remember all of them. 

Q Okay. What time of day was it? 


MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 


A Afternoon. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) How late? 

A Anywhere between 2 to 4. 

Q And what time did you get off of work?

Q And what was the rest of your conversation 


with Ms. Maxwell? 
I'm sorry, I don't think you finished. 

A Thank you. Well, she noticed I was 
reading the massage book. And I started to have 
chitchat with her just about, you know, the body and 
the anatomy and how I was interested in it. And she

told me that she knew somebody who was looking for a 
traveling masseuse. 

And I said, Well, I don't have any 
accreditations. This is the first book I've ever 
read. She goes, That's okay. I know somebody. We 
can train you. We can get you educated. You know, 
we can help you along the way if you pass the 
interview. 

If the guy likes you, then, you know, it 
will work out for you. You'll travel. You'll make 
good money. You'll be educated, and you'll finally 
get accredited one day. 

Q Okay. 

A She finished off by, you know, giving me 
her number. And I told her I'd have to ask my dad. 
And I called my dad. I ran over, actually, to see my 
dad, talked to him. He said it would be okay. I 
used the phone from Mar-a-Lago to call her and tell 
her that I was allowed to come over. 

And she said, Great. Meet me here at -- I 
don't remember the exact address, but it was 
El Brillo Way in Palm Beach -- after you get off. 
And my dad drove me.

that she gave?

had that conversation with you? 


A No, she did not. 

Q Did you tell her your age? 

A No, I did not. 

Q And so somewhere you wrote down a phone 


number to call her back at? 


A Um-hum. 

Q All right. And where did you write that 
down? 

A Probably just a piece of paper lying 


around the desk. 
Q Okay. But you don't remember? 
A I mean, no, I don't have that piece of 


paper anymore, so no. 


Q Okay. And did you write down an address? 
A Yes. 
Q And what number do you think you called?

Q When did you get your first car? 

A After my trip to London to meet Prince 
Andrew. 

Q Okay. What kind of car did you get? 

A A Dodge Dakota. 


And did you purchase that yourself? 
Yes, I did. 


And how much did it cost? 


Pr O PF 0 


I don't remember off the top of my head 
how much it cost. 

Q Who did you buy it from? 

A My dad helped me bargain with it. I don't 
remember where we bought it from. 

Q And was the title put in your name or your 


dad's name? 


A I think the title was put in my name. I 
think. I mean, my dad was with me. I've never 
registered a car or anything like that before. So -- 

Q So that was your first time? 

A Yes. 

Q Memorable, right? 

A Yes. 

Q When you got there, a butler or someone 


answered the door, is that what you said? 
A No, Ghislaine answered the door.

A Yes. 

Q Who else was at home when you got home? 

A My mom, my dad and my brother. 

Q Which brother? 

A Sky. 

Q And anyone else who was there at the time? 
A I believe Michael might have been living 


with me at that time. So he might have been there. 

Q Do you recall if he was there when you got 
home? 

A I don't really remember. I remember what 
I did when I got home, that I basically made a 
beeline for the bathroom. 

Q Let me ask you a question. Michael was 
living with you at that home, at your parents' home 


at the time, is your best recollection today; is that 


right? 
A That's my best recollection, yes. 
Q When you say living with you, were you 


guys staying in the same room? 


A Yes. 
Q Were you engaged at that time to him? 
A That was a really weird relationship. He 


was a friend who looked after me, and he did propose 
to me and I did say yes. But my heart was never in

it. 
He was somebody that helped me off the 
streets so I felt compelled to say yes to him. 

Q Okay. So when he proposed to you and you 
said yes, did that take place before you started 
working at Mar-a-Lago or after you started working at 
Mar-a-Lago? 

A Before. 

Q And so if he were living with your parents 
at that time, you were living in the same room; is 


that correct? 


A I believe so. 

Q And your parents understood him to be your 
fiance? 

A I don't think they agreed with it, but I 


think they understood it as that. I mean -- 

Q I mean, you communicated to them that he 
had proposed and you had accepted? 

A Yeah, in not such a pretty way. I mean, 
they obviously weren't very happy about it. And it 
wasn't my true intentions to ever marry him. 

Q Okay. 

A But I did it to make him feel okay. I 
didn't want to be mean.

A I believe Juan Alessi was pretty much 


within ear distance. 


Q Could you see him? 

A Yes. 

Q Okay. 

A Like I said, in ear distance, when I mean 


ear distance like hearing, in the hearing vicinity. 
And it was in the same time that she was asking him 
to drop me off at home. 

Q Okay. When you were driving home the 
first night with Juan Alessi, did you have any 
conversation with him? 

A No. I had told him my address. It was a 


very quiet ride. 


Q Did you ride in the front or the back? 
A The front. 
Q It is your contention that, Ghislaine 


Maxwell had sex with underage girls virtually every 
day when I was around her, correct? 

A Yes. 

Q All right. With whom did Ghislaine 
Maxwell have sex in your presence? 

A Well, there's a lot of girls that were 
involved. We weren't on a first name basis with each 
other. I wouldn't be able to give you lists of names

of girls. It was continuous. 
Q It was continuous. Name one girl that 
Ghislaine Maxwell had sex with in your presence. 
A Emmy Taylor. I mean, that's a name that I 
know well because Emmy was always around. 
I'm trying to think of her name, sorry. 
Sarah. Her name used to be Sarah Kellen. I think 
she's changed it now that she's married. 
| (phonetic) -- I can't 
pronounce her last name properly, but it's around 
those lines. 
There were a lot of other girls that I 
honestly can't remember their names. I'm sorry. I 
wish I could help out more because I really would 
like to provide more witnesses for this, but I can't 
remember a lot of girls' names. 
Q So those are the three names of females 
that you observed Ghislaine Maxwell have sex with -- 
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) -- is that what I 
understand your answer to be?

Q More than 20? 

A I would say more than 20. 

Q More than 50? 

A I don't think more than 50, but -- 

Q Did -- 

A I don't have an exact number. I mean, 
if -- I think if you look at the flight logs, you 


know, that helps, but then they're not fully 
complete. We only have flight logs to one plane and 


then there's a time I was flown commercially into the 


island. 

Q Um-hum. 

A So it's really hard for me to gauge a 
number. 

Q Okay. Do you have any photographs of 


yourself on the island? 

A I know I used to, but they would be left 
in that apartment. 

Q What other locations did you participate 
in sexual contact with Ghislaine Maxwell, other than 


the island? 


A Everywhere. New York, Palm Beach. 
Q Where in New York? 

A The mansion, Jeffrey's mansion. 

Q Okay. Anywhere else in New York?

think I met Prince Andrew in 2001. And Glenn Dubin 
and Stephen Kaufmann were, like I said, the first 
people I was sent out to after my training. So TI 
don't know. I'm not going to give you an exact time 


if I don't know it. 


Q I asked you the relative order. 
A And I'm trying to give you it. 
Q And where does Alan Dershowitz fit into 


that group of people? 


A Same. I can't tell you piece by piece by 
piece who -- I know Glenn Dubin was first. 

Q Okay. 

A And I know Stephen Kaufmann was one of the 


first I was sent to. Alan Dershowitz could have been 

between there. Between, sorry, between Glenn and 

Stephen. The first time I was with Alan Dershowitz 

was in New York, so I wasn't actually sent to him. 

It actually happened at one of Jeffrey's residences. 
(Ms. McCawley left the deposition.) 

A So it's very hard for me to 
chronologically give you each person individually. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Okay. Name the other 
politically connected and financially powerful people 
that Ghislaine Maxwell told you to go have sex with?

because that's how it went. They instructed me to go 
to George Mitchell, Jean Luc Brunel, Bill Richardson, 
another prince that I don't know his name. A guy 
that owns a hotel, a really large hotel chain, I 
can't remember which hotel it was. Marvin Minsky. 

There was, you know, another foreign 
president, I can't remember his name. He was 
Spanish. There's a whole bunch of them that I 
just -- it's hard for me to remember all of them. 
You know, I was told to do something by these people 
constantly, told to -- my whole life revolved around 
just pleasing these men and keeping Ghislaine and 
Jeffrey happy. Their whole entire lives revolved 
around sex. 

They call massages sex. They call 
modeling sex. They call -- 

Q I asked you the names for people. Are you 
going to tell me any other names or is that all of 
them? 

A I'm trying to think. That's the answer 
I'm trying to give to you. It's that it's so hard to 
just keep naming and naming and naming.

many times you want me to keep answering this 
question. Both told me to do this, okay? They both 
sent me to these people. 

How many times do you want me to answer 
this? 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) I think you're 
answering a different question so that's why I'm 
going to ask you again. I am not asking you anything 
about a time when Jeffrey and Ghislaine together told 
you to go do something. I'm asking you to name a 
single time during which Ghislaine Maxwell acting 
alone directed you to go have sex with another 
person? 

MR. EDWARDS: Objection. Asked and 
answered. Harassing. Argumentative. 

A I've given you the names of the people 
that Ghislaine instructed me to go have sexual 
relations with. I am not discluding (sic) the fact 
that Jeffrey also told me. 

Ghislaine told me from her mouth to do 
these things. Jeffrey told me from his mouth to do 
these things with these people. Ghislaine instructed 
me to do the things that I did with Jeffrey Epstein 
on the very first meeting that I had with him. She 
brought me there under the preclusion (sic) that I

was going to be trained as a masseuse and that she 
instructed me to take off my clothes and to give oral 
sex to Jeffrey Epstein. 
Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Excuse me. I've asked 
you for the names. 
A I've just given you a name. Jeffrey 


Epstein is a big name. 


Q All right. 
A She instructed me on that one. 
Q So you're saying -- 


MR. EDWARDS: The witness is finishing her 
answer right now. She's in the process of explaining 
one of the people Ghislaine told her to have sex 
with. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) So you're saying 
Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to have sex with 
Jeffrey Epstein? 

A Correct. 

Q Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to have sex 
with Glenn Dubin? 

A Correct. 

Q What words did Ghislaine Maxwell tell you 
to go have sex with Glenn Dubin?

A I can't tell you where we were. I know

to =- 

A New Mexico.

to New Mexico.

A No, she was not in the room. She was in 
another cabana. 

Q And other than telling you to go give the 
owner of this large hotel chain a massage, do you 
remember any other words she used to you to direct 
you in what you should do? 

A Not at the time, no. 

Q Where did -- where were you and where was 
Ms. Maxwell when she directed you to go have sex with 
Marvin Minsky? 

MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 

A I don't know. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Where did you go to 
have sex with Marvin Minsky? 

A I believe it was the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
Jeff's -- sorry, Jeffrey Epstein's island in the U.S. 


Virgin Islands. 


Q And when was that? 

A I don't know. 

Q Do you have any time of year? 

A No. 

Q Do you know how old you were?

another prince, the large hotel chain owner and 
Marvin Minsky, is there anyone else that Ghislaine 
Maxwell directed you to go have sex with? 

A I am definitely sure there is. But can I 
remember everybody's name? No. 

Q Okay. Can you remember anything else 
about them? 

A Look, I've given you what I know right 
now. I'm sorry. This is very hard for me and very 
frustrating to have to go over this. I don't -- I 
don't recall all of the people. There was a large 
amount of people that I was sent to. 

Q Do you have any notes of all these people 


that you were sent to? 


A No, I don't. 

Q Where are your notes? 

A I burned them. 

Q When did you burn them? 

A In a bonfire when I lived at Titusville 


because I was sick of going through this shit. 

Q Did you have lawyers who were representing 
you at the time you built a bonfire and burned these 
notes? 

A I've been represented for a long time, but 
it was not under the instruction of my lawyers to do

this. My husband and I were pretty spiritual people 
and we believed that these memories were worth 
burning. 
Q So you burned notes of the men with whom 
you had sex while you were represented by counsel in 
litigation, correct? 


MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 


A This wasn't anything that was a public 
document. This was my own private journal, and I 
didn't want it anymore. So we burned it. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) When did you write 


that journal? 

A Just over time. I started writing it 
probably in, I don't know, I can't speculate, 2012, 
2011. 

Q So you did not write this journal at the 
time it happened? 

A No. 

Q You started writing this journal 
approximately a decade after you claim you finished 
being sexually trafficked, correct? 

A Yes. 

Q And you started writing a journal after 
you had a lawyer, correct?

THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're back on the 
record at 2:55. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Do you have any 
photographs of yourself either nude or in a sexually 
compromising position that you claim were taken by 
Ghislaine Maxwell? 

A I do not have any of those in my evidence. 


But if you ask Ghislaine Maxwell, she would have 


plenty. 

Q Do you have any in your storage boxes in 
Sydney? 

A No. 

Q Do you know whether your attorneys have 


any such photographs that you claim were taken by 


Ghislaine Maxwell? 


A No. 
Q You don't know or they don't have them? 
A I don't know. And I don't think they have 


them. If they had them, they would have told me. 
You should ask your client. She's got plenty of 
them. 

Q What type of camera did Ghislaine Maxwell 
use? 

A It was a black camera. And it had a, I 
don't know the types and names of them, but the lens

that goes out. 


Q Was it digital or single reflex? 
A Again, I don't know types of cameras. I 
mean, I use my phone for using a camera. So it's a 


black camera and it had a lens that you could put out 


further or bring back. 


Q Did you ask her to take any photographs of 
you? 

A No. She asked to take photographs of me. 

Q Was it a film or a digital camera? 

A I never saw how she printed them out. 

Q What's the first time you told anybody 


that you had been sexually trafficked? 
MR. EDWARDS: Form. 

A Tony Figueroa, my ex-boyfriend, knew some 
of the stuff that was happening, though I did not go 
in great detail to him, being that he's my boyfriend. 
And then the first person I really opened up to about 
everything was my husband. 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did you tell Tony 
Figueroa that you were forced to have sex with 
Jeffrey Epstein? 

A Yes.

to have sex with Ghislaine Maxwell?

any interactions with law enforcement? 


A Yes. 
Q When? 
A When I tried to break away from Jeffrey 


and Ghislaine, I started making myself unavailable. 
And I got a job at Road House Grill. And Tony used 
to come pick me up in the afternoons, at nighttime, 
and he'd sit at the bar. And there's this big cup 
that's got tips in it. 

I was in the back room. And I had to -- 
first you have to sign out and you have to take off 
your aprons, put your aprons away. And there's a 
whole bunch of cleaning up stuff you have to do. 

In that time period, Tony grabbed money 
from a cup that had money in it. That was for the 
bartenders for their tips. My boss called me the 
next day. He told me that I had stolen the money, 
which I hadn't. And I came back and I returned the 
money after I confronted Tony about it. Gave the 
money back to him and he said, I'm sorry, but it's 
just law that I have to call the police. So he 
called the police. 

And knowing that Jeffrey has got the Palm 
Beach Police Department in his pocket, I went to 
Jeffrey Epstein and I told him what had happened.

And Jeffrey said, Don't worry about it. Let me take 
care of it for you. 
Q Okay. I'm sorry. When did you have 


interaction with law enforcement, then? 


A What year? 

Q Did you speak with a law enforcement 
officer? 

A I don't believe I spoke to them. Jeffrey 


handled everything. 


Q Okay. And you said that you had finished 
your shift at -- this is at the Road House Grill, 
correct? 

A Correct. 

Q You had finished your shift? 

A Yeah, it was the end of the shift. 

Q Okay. And you had cleaned up and were 


checking out, correct? 
A Yeah, it's a completely separate part of 
the -- it's like back of the house. Do you know what 


that means, like in waitering terms? 


Q (Indicating. ) 
A Yeah, back of the house. 
Q And what was -- who was this boss that you 


spoke to? 
A I can't remember his name.

exclusivity? 
A Yes. 
Q What was that period? 
A I believe it was like a three-month period 


or something. 

Q Okay. And what other terms of the 
contract, do you recall? 

A I couldn't talk to any other news 


publication about the story. 


Q Anything else? 

A Not that I know of. 

Q Were you happy when the period was up? 
A Well, I mean, at that time I wanted to 


write about my story. So I guess, yes, I was happy 
when that period was up. 

Q And you were actively writing a book at 
that time, correct? 

A My manuscript. I've never published it. 

Q You were writing the manuscript at the 
time of your period of exclusivity with Sharon 
Churcher, correct? 

A Those three months were just craziness. I 
think I started after that. 

Q You think you started writing the book 
after the 90 days were up?

A Yeah. 

Q And then you attempted to sell that 
manuscript, correct? 

A I didn't attempt to sell it. I went to 
other publications, like, what do you call them? 
People -- I'm trying to think of the name of the 
word. People who publish books, not like a newspaper 
or anything. And I inquired about what they thought 
of my manuscript and if they thought it was, you 
know, a good story. And, yeah. 

Q So you sent the manuscript to these people 


for the purposes of trying to publish the book, 


correct? 
A Some people, yes. 
Q And you were trying to get money from the 


book publication, correct? 


A Well, I wasn't going to sell it to them 
for free. 
Q But you were unsuccessful in finding 


someone to publish it, correct? 
A Well, I was always on the fence with it. 
I wasn't too sure if I wanted to or didn't want to. 
I was more seeking judgment based upon these people 
who have done this plenty and plenty of times. 
Still to this day, I mean, I've had people

who have been interested in it and I still don't know 
if I want to do it yet. I mean, I think there's a 
lot more that can go into it, you know. 

Q You were actively sending the manuscript 
to people for purposes of having them reach a deal 
with you and publish it, correct? 

A No deal was ever talked about. What we 
talked about was the possibility of publishing it, is 
it publishing-worthy, would I need to get a 
ghostwriter. You know, this is the first time I've 


ever written a manuscript so I didn't know what I was 


doing. 

Q Okay. You contacted Jarred Weisfeld, 
correct? 

A Correct. 

Q I'm going to mark a document as 


Defendant's Exhibit 16. It is a composite exhibit.

calm the anxiety and everything down. 
Q Before you met Jeffrey Epstein, had you 
used any drugs? 
A Sure, yes. 
Q Which drugs had you used prior to meeting 


Jeffrey Epstein? 


A I smoked pot. I've taken Ecstasy. 

Q Cocaine? 

A Yeah, I would have snorted cocaine, 
um-hum. 

Q Did you ever abuse alcohol before meeting 


Jeffrey Epstein? 

A No, I was -- I wasn't even of age to be 
able to buy it. I mean, if there was alcohol at 
parties I would have drank it, but I wouldn't say I 
abused it. 

Q Okay. Were there ever occasions upon 
which you were observed to be drunk by other people, 
prior to meeting Jeffrey Epstein? 

A If you're drinking, the possibility of 
getting drunk is always there. I don't -- I can't 
recall exact situation where that was the case, 
but -- 

Q Were you diagnosed as a drug addict prior 
to meeting Jeffrey Epstein?

A Yes. 
Q And you believe the Neiman Marcus was 
located in which city? 
A Well, it's around Fort Lauderdale. I 
can't tell you exactly. Fort Lauderdale is so big, 


like Broward County? Is that the word for it? 


Q And what did you do at Neiman Marcus? 

A I worked in the changing rooms. 

Q And what did you do in the changing room? 
A I think I just like -- if I remember 


right, I just put clothes away that people left in 
there. Probably went out to get sizes, different 
sizes for women who wanted different sizes of the 


same product. 


Q And where did you work after Neiman 
Marcus? 

A Taco Bell. 

Q Did you work at Southeast Employee 


Management Company? 


A I don't recognize that. I don't know if 
that's a payroll company or what it is. I don't know 
what Southeast -- what is it called? 

Q Southeast Employee Management Company. 

A No, I don't remember that.

Q Going to different offices and filling in? 
A No. 

Q Did you work for Oasis Outsourcing? 

A I don't -- I don't know if that's a 


payroll company or if that's an actual place, but 
that doesn't ring a bell. 

Q Did you -- do you know how much you got 
paid when you were working at places like Oasis 
Outsourcing? 

A Well, considering I don't know if I worked 


at Oasis Outsourcing, I wouldn't even know how much I 


got paid. 
Q Did you review your Social Security 
records? 
A Yes. 
Q You saw Oasis Outsourcing listed there? 
A Right, but like I said, it doesn't even 


ding a bell at all. 
Q Do you know how much money they said you 
made from them?

A Yeah, if you could. I'm happy to answer 
your questions. I want to be helpful, so... 

Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Great. Well, do you 


remember how much money you made from Oasis 
Outsourcing? 

A Like I said, I don't even remember working 
for Oasis Outsourcing, or what it is, so I couldn't 
tell you. 

Q Do you remember how much money you were 


making per hour at Neiman Marcus? 


A No, not off the top of my head. 

Q Do you know how many months you worked 
there? 

A Not long. I'd probably say -- I mean, I 
don't know. I'm not going to guess. But around the 
three-month mark would be my -- I don't know the 


exact answer. 


Q Do you remember any of your coworkers? 

A No. 

Q Did you work at Mannino's? 

A Briefly, yes. 

Q What is Mannino's? 

A A cute little Italian restaurant in 
Wellington.

Q And what did you do at Mannino's? 

A I did waitressing.

A Again, very shortly. Short time period, 


and I was a waitress again. 


Q And how much did you make there? 

A I have no idea. 

Q Did you get fired? 

A No. 

Q Why did you leave? 

A I was -- that's around the time period 
that I was approached by -- I can't remember his 


name, but he owned a veterinary clinic or he was a 
vet, one of the two, and he offered me to come work 
for him. 

Q When you were working at TG -- TGI 


Fridays, were you also working at the Roadhouse 


Grill? 
A No. 
Q Those were not at the same time?

consecutively like after each other.

Grill? 

A Yes. 

Q And why did you leave there? 

A We all know that the thing that went down 
there. Tony picked me up and took some money out of 


a jar, and then I went to go give it back to the guy, 
thinking that it would be all right, and it wasn't. 
So I got fired, I think.

longer locate that agreement. 
Q. Was that agreement ever renewed? 
A. It was renewed, I believe on or around the 


beginning of January 2015, potentially the 2nd of January 


via email. 
QO. Was the agreement revised when it was renewed? 
A. It wasn't revised. It was a straightforward 


re-establishment of the original agreement. 
Q. Is it your belief that that agreement was in 


effect on January 2nd, 2015? 


A. Yes. 
Q. Do you recall the terms of that agreement? 
A. Well, it was a re-establishment of an existing 


agreement so if we go back to the original agreement, it 
was to provide public relations services to Ms. Maxwell 
in the matter of Guiffre and her activities. 

MS. SCHULTZ: I'm marking as Exhibit 2, a 
document labeled GM 00068. 

(Exhibit 2 was marked for identification) 

MR. DYER: Why don't you start making a pile of 
them, Mr. Gow, because it may be that later on you'll be 
asked to go back to them. 

THE WITNESS: Yes, sir. 

MR. DYER: You don't have copies for me of 


these documents?

22 Philip Barden and Ms. Maxwell at Devonshires law office,

24 unpleasant allegations about Ms. Maxwell's private life.

was called in to protect Ms. Maxwell's reputation, and 
to set the record straight. That was -- and that work 
commenced on or around March of 2011. 

Q. What do you mean by "set the record straight"? 

A. Ms. Guiffre's allegations about Ms. Maxwell 
were, we believe, and to this day continue to believe, 
untrue, defamatory, and fantastical. And with 
Devonshires' lawyers, we set about putting out -- 
crafting a statement which would put Ms. Maxwell's point 
of view across that Ms. Guiffre's allegations were untrue 
and, frankly, abhorrent. 

Q. What advice did you give Miss Maxwell as part 
of your retention? 

A. It is standard procedure in cases where it's 
understood that a party may be defaming one's client that 
one puts out a statement correcting those allegations and 
providing a clearer picture of where the truth lies. So 
it was very much our counsel that Ms. Maxwell put out a 
statement, vehemently denying the allegations. 

Q. When you testified that Ms. Guiffre, I'm going 
to refer to her by just her married name, came to your 
attention at that March 2011 meeting at Devonshires with 
Mr. Barden and Ms. Maxwell, correct, and you learned 
about her at that meeting; is that correct? 


A. Correct.

remaining, so... 
I've marked as Exhibit 3 RG(UK) 00002. Do you 
recognize this email? 
A. I do. 
Q:; Did you receive this email? 
A. I did, on the -- on New Year's Day 2015. 
Q. Did you contact Ms. Maxwell after receiving 


this email? 


A. I did. 

Qo. Did you make any response to Mr. Ball in any 
form? 

A. I did. 

Q. Can you tell me what you -- what response you 
made? 


A. Well, the response to Mr. Ball was part of a 
series of responses having spoken to my client within 24 
hours or so, we got back to Mr. Ball with an agreed 
statement which went out to a number of media. 

Q. When you say "agreed statement" can you tell me 
more about what you mean? Who agreed to the statement? 

A. I need to give you some context, if I may, 
about that statement. 

So, this is on New Year's Day. I was 
in France so the email time here of 21:46, in French 


time was 22:46, and I was getting up early the next

morning to drive my family back from the south of 
France to England, which is a 14-hour journey, door to 
door. So on the morning of the 2nd of January, 
bearing in mind that Ms. Maxwell, I think was in New 
York then, she was five hours behind, so there was 
quite a lot of, sort of time difference between the 
various countries here, I sent her an email, I 
believe, saying -- parsing this -- forwarding this 
email to her saying "How do you wish to proceed?" And 
then I was on the telephone -- I had two telephones in 
the car, I received in excess of 30 phone calls from 
various media outlets on the 2nd of January, all 
asking for information about how Ms. Maxwell was 
looking to respond to the latest court filings, which 
were filed on the 30th of December as I understand. 

And by close -- towards close of play 
on the 2nd, I received an email forwarded by 
Ms. Maxwell, containing a draft statement which my 
understanding was the majority of which had been 
drafted by Mr. Barden with a header along the lines of 
"This is the agreed statement." At close of play on 
the 2nd. 

So I -- I was -- I had gone under the 
Channel Tunnel and I was sitting on the other side and 


that email, which my understanding was that it had

been signed off by the client, effectively, was then 
sent out to a number of media, including Mr. Ball and 
various other UK newspapers. 

Q. Mr. Gow, when you say "end of play" and "close 
of play," are you referring to sending the email that's 
Exhibit 2? 

A. Yes, I am. 

MR. DYER: My understanding is that it went to 
people other than those listed? 

THE WITNESS: Yes, that is -- 

MR. DYER: Just a sample. 

THE WITNESS: That is a sample. Everyone who 
effectively -- well, the detail on this, I was driving, 
so my eldest son in the back had my BlackBerry and was 
trying to capture -- it was a pretty chaotic day. 

Most people in the UK were on holiday. In fact, 
it was a holiday weekend, our office was closed, my PA was 
on holiday, so my son was basically doing an internship in 
the back of the car, downloading the names of the callers 
from various media outlets and -- so we had a list of 
those so when I got to the car park, at the end of the 
Eurotunnel thing in the UK, I had numerous names, so the 
email went out to a wide range of people. 

But the 30 or so calls I had is an aggregate 


number, so there might have been five calls from the BBC

this email chain is? 

A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday 
in the UK, but Mr. Barden was not necessarily accessible, 
at some point in time, so this had been sent to him 
originally by Ms. Maxwell, and because he was 
unavailable, she forwarded it to me for immediate action. 
I therefore respond, "Okay, Ghislaine, I'll go with 
this." 

It is my understanding that this is 
the agreed statement because the subject of the second 
one is "Urgent, this is the statement" so I take that 
as an instruction to send it out, as a positive 
command: "This is the statement." 

Q. Okay. 

A. And I say, "Thanks, Philip" because I'm aware 
of the fact that he had a hand, a considerable hand in 
the drafting. 

Q. Okay. Could I ask you to please refer back to 
Exhibit 2. Looking also at Exhibit 9, Exhibit 9 appears 
to have five sentences in it. Do you agree that those 
same five sentences are part of the communication that is 
borne in Exhibit 2? 

A. Sorry, could you say that again. I'm just 
following what your -- 


0. It was a bad question. Let me try that again.

1 Q. Okay. Have you ever communicated anything 
2 regarding Ms. Guiffre's criminal allegations to the press 
3 or the media? 
4 A. As part of a wider conversation about her 
5 unsavory allegations about Ms. Maxwell, it's possible 
6 that I might have done, but I can't recall the detail, 
7 I'm afraid. 
8 0: Do you -- do you remember discussing that with 
9 The Guardian? 
10 A. No, I don't. I'm not saying I didn't but I 
11 can't recall. You have to bear in mind, if you'd be so 
12 kind, that I've been speaking to over 30 journalists and 
13. media outlets about this, and I can't recall every single 
14 -- the detail of every single conversation. 
15 Q. Earlier you testified with regard to Exhibit 2 
16 that in the days following sending that email, you also 
17 communicated with other press and media outlets. Do you 
18 recall today any of the other press and media outlets you 
19 communicated with, in addition to those listed at the top 
20 of that email? 
21 A. The Guardian, The Sun, from the top of my 
22 memory, but in addition to -- in addition to emails there 
23 would have been telephone calls and I'm -- there may not 
24 be a transcript of those calls, these are emails inter 
25 alia, others, and I can't recall every single email that

Q. That's all the questions I have about that 
document . 

A. Thank you. 

Q. Regarding communications you made after sending 
the email in Exhibit 2, I believe, and please correct me 
if I'm wrong, you testified that you received 30 or more 
calls that were -- that you would classify as press 
inquiries regarding Ms. Guiffre; is that correct? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Do you recall emailing the statement to other 
entities beyond what is on the list on Exhibit 2? 

A. Yes, I think I answered that previously. Yes 
I mean there is a far -- I said inter alia, so there is a 
wider range of people that I would have emailed it to in 


response to incoming queries -- 


Q. Do you -- 

A BU. vl iS 

Q. Sorry. 

A. I can't remember every single one. 

Q Do you recall ever reading the statement to the 


press or the media over the phone? 
A. It's very possible that I would have done so, 


yes.

MR. DYER: Do you mean Exhibit 2? 

MS. SCHULTZ: Yes. Exhibit 2. 

THE WITNESS: To be clear, Exhibit 2 was the 
base document. 

MS. SCHULTZ: Uh-hmm. 

THE WITNESS: In addition to the 2011 March 
statement. Those were the two working documents that 
were always referred to, both of which -- well, the first 
one was in a public domain and was on record on the 
Devonshires -- on -- with Devonshires name at the top on 
PR Newswire which is a global delivery service. So that 
was easily accessible by people. And the second one was 
the -- further to the 2nd of January 2015. 

BY MS. SCHULTZ: 

0. To the extent you can recall or could estimate, 
how many other emails do you believe you sent bearing 
that statement that's in Exhibit 2? 

A. I really can't remember but certainly more than 
six and probably less than 30, somewhere in between. 

Any time there was an incoming query 
it was either dealt with on the telephone by referring 
them back to the two statements of March 2011 and 
January 2015 or someone would email them the 
statement. So no one was left unanswered, broadly, is 


the -- is where we were. But I can't remember every

Q. Okay. So is it your testimony that you reached 


out to individuals who did not first contact you? 


A. No. We were in response mode. 
Q. Okay. 
A. There was enough to do responding to incoming 


queries, I wouldn't have been making more work, to be 
honest. 
Q. Alright. 
MR. DYER: So journalists paid no attention to 


your "No further communication will be provided on the 


matter."

18 the case that Mr. Barden and I were encouraging 
19 Ms. Maxwell to make a statement, but she was very 
20 reluctant to do so. 
21 MR. DYER: Right. I think you've got him to 
22 accept that up until some time March, April, May, he may

21 been involved in some number of years of therapy, in 
22 which the purpose -- part of the purpose of the

2 Q. I'm not talking about friends. I'm 


3 talking about individuals -- 


4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to object 
3 to you interrupting the witness who was 
6 answering your question. The question 
7 was, have you ever seen anyone, female 
8 under the age of 18 at the house and 
9 that's the question she was answering. 
10 If you want to strike that question and 
11 ask another question, feel free, but let 
12 the witness respond, please. 
13 MS. McCAWLEY: I will do that. 
14 Q. Have you ever observed a female 


15 under the age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home 


16 that was not a friend, a child -- one of your 
17 friend's children? 

18 A. Again, I can't testify to that 

19 because I have no idea what you are talking 
20 about. 

Al Q. You have no idea what I'm talking 
22 about in the sense you never observed a 


23 female under the age of 18 at Jeffrey 
24 Epstein's home that was not one of your 


25 friend's children, is that correct?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

4 A. How would I possibly know how 
3D: someone is when they are at his house. You 
6 are asking me to do that. I cannot possibly 


7 testify to that. As far as I'm concerned, 


8 everyone who came to his house was an adult 
9 professional person.

2 -- just another one of Virginia's many 
3 fictitious lies and stories to make this a 
4 salacious event to get interest and press. 


3 It's absolute rubbish. 
6 Q. Were you in charge of hiring 
a individuals to provide massages for Jeffrey 


8 Epstein? 


9 A. My job included hiring many people. 
10 There were six homes. As I sit here, I hired 
11 assistants, I hired architects, I hired 
12 decorators, I hired cooks, I hired cleaners, 


13 I hired gardeners, I hired pool people, I 


14 hired pilots, I hired all sorts of people. 


15 In the course and a very small part 
16 of my job was from from time to time to find 
17 adult professional massage therapists for 


18 Jeffrey. 


19 Q. When you say adult professional 

20 massage therapists, where did you find these 
21 massage therapists? 

22 A. From time to time I would visit 

23 professional spas, I would receive a massage 


24 and if the massage was good I would ask that 


25) man or woman if they did home visits.

2 Q. Did you hire her? 
3 A. First of all, I don't hire girls 


4 like that, so let's be clear, I already 


5 testified to that, and I have no idea what 


6 you are referring to. 

7 O% When you say girls like that, what 
8 do you mean? 

9 A. I hire people who are professional 


10 at the house. You are asking if I hired 
1 somebody to do what, I don't know what you 
12 are talking about. I hired people to work in 


13 the homes. 


14 Q. What was Nadia Marcinkova doing? 
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form 
16 and foundation. 

17 A. I have no idea what Nadia 

18 Marcinkova was doing. I didn't hire her and 
19 I don't know what you are referring to.

6 are referring to. Would you like to ask the 


7 question properly? 

8 Q. I think it was proper. I will ask 
9 it again. 

10 Did you ever assist in getting 

1 Virginia Roberts a cell phone to use during 


12 the time that she worked for Jeffrey Epstein? 
13 A. I have no recollection of doing 

14 anything of that nature. 

15 Q. Did you ever tell Virginia that you 
16 wanted her to have a cell phone so that she 


17 could be on call regularly? 


18 A. I have no recollection of that 

19 conversation. 

20 0% How often would Virginia come over 

21 to the house in Palm Beach to give massages? 

22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the 

23 form and foundation.

25. 0. How often did Virginia Roberts come

2 over to the house in Palm Beach to give 
3 massages? 
4 A. It's important to understand that I 


5 wasn't with Jeffrey all the time. In fact, I 


6 was only in the house less than half the 


z time, so I cannot testify to when I wasn't in 
8 the house how often she came when I wasn't 

9 there. 

10 What I can say is that I barely 

11 would remember her, if not for all of this 


12 rubbish, I probably wouldn't remember her at 
13 all, except she did come from time to time 
14 but I don't recollect her coming as often as 
15 she portrayed herself. 

16 Q. How many times a day on an average 


17 day would Jeffrey Epstein get a massage? 


18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the 

19 form and foundation. 

20 A. When I was at the house and when I 
Al. was there with him, he received a massage, on 
22 average, about once a day. 

23 Q. Just once? 

24 A. Yes. 

25 QO. Were there days when he received

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

2. him at any of those homes? 
3 A. Again, Virginia is absolutely 


4 totally lying. This is a subject of 

D defamation about Virginia and the lies she 

6 has told and one of lies she told was that 

7 President Clinton was on the island where I 

8 was present. Absolutely 1000 percent that is 
9 a flat out total fabrication and lie. 

10 Q. You did fly on planes, Jeffrey 

11 Epstein's planes with President Clinton, is 


12 that correct? 


13 A. I have flown, yes.

15 President Clinton and Jeffrey are friends?

17 it like that, no.

3 were on the trip in Europe?

2 her but you would have to ask Jeffrey what he 


3 brought her on the trip for. 


4 Q. But she would travel with him when 
3D: there was a work trip like this? 
6 A. I can't -- I'm seeing that she is 


at on this flight but I have no idea what she is 


8 doing, he invited her, it would not be my 
9 job. 
10 0. What about Nadia Bjorlin, would she 


11 regularly travel with Jeffrey on flights? 
12 A. I have no idea, you would have to 


13 look through the flight logs. I have no 


14 idea. 
15 Q. Your recollection is -- what is 
16 your recollection, do you recollect Nadia 


17 traveling often on flights with Jeffrey?

19 don't recollect her actually on the flight at

3 are but from the message pads. 


4 Did you want to correct anything? 
3 A. I want to make an addendum. 

6 Would you mind rereading the last 
7 question back to me? 

8 (Record read.) 

9 A. I also just want to say that at 


10 this point I cannot recollect flying to 

1 parties. Jeffrey went for work so -- was 

12 this in Santa Fe, this flight as well. 

13 Q. The flight we were looking at, yes 
14 but it was to Santa Fe -- 

15 A. I don't recall going to any parties 
16 in Santa Fe at any time but certainly flying 
AT to Santa Fe for a party seems highly 

18 improbable. 

19 Q. So I'm going to direct your 

20 attention to the document that I set before

2 with Jeffrey in Palm Beach, do you recall a 


3 process for taking, anybody at the house 


4 taking messages when incoming phone calls 

3 came in? 

6 A. You are supposed to take a message 
7 and receive the message and write the message 
8 down. Who was the message was for, what time 


9 it was taken and who took it and what the 


10 message was, obviously. 
11 Q. Does what's in front of you look 
12 familiar with respect to the message pads

14 A. It is familiar. 
15 Q. I'm going to direct your attention 


16 to the second page of it? 


17 MR. PAGLIUCA: These all have SAO 
18 numbers on them or Bates ranges and I 

19 don't see any of your Bates ranges on 

20 these. I know you have produced message 
21 pads but those have your Bates range 

22 numbers on them and I'm wondering if 

23 these are different documents. 

24 MS. McCAWLEY: It's the same, just

3 A. I can only testify -- 

4 Q. Let me finish the question so the 
3 record is clear. 

6 Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein 

7 sexually abused minors? 

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the 

9 form and foundation. 

10 QO. You can answer. 

11 A. I can only testify to what I know. 
12 I know that Virginia is a liar and I know 
13 what she testified is a lie. So I can only 


14 testify to what I know to be a falsehood and 
15 half those falsehoods are enormous and so I 
16 can only categorically deny everything she 
17 has said and that is the only thing I can 

18 talk about because I have no knowledge of 

19 anything else. 

20 Q. I'm not asking about Virginia. I'm 
21 asking whether you believe that Jeffrey 

22 Epstein sexually abused minors? 

23 A. Again, I repeat, I can only go on 
24 what I know and what I know is a falsehood 


25) based on what Virginia said.

2 What I'm asking you is whether you 
3 believe Jeffrey Epstein abused minors? 
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form 
3 and you made your record, she answered 
6 the question. A fair reading of her 
7 answer is she doesn't have a belief 
8 because she doesn't have any personal 
9 knowledge.

1. testifying for the witness. Let her 
12 answer the question. 
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: It's a fair answer 
14 to the question. 
15 Aw Again, I testified my only personal 
16 knowledge concerns Virginia and everything 
17 Virginia has said is an absolute lie, which 
18 is why we are here in this room. If you are 
19 asking me to testify about things I have no 
20 knowledge of other than the police report 
21 that you showed me, I am not in a position to 
22 make a statement based on that because you 
23 are asking me to speculate and I cannot 
24 speculate.

Ay Q. Ms. Maxwell, is it your belief that 
18 Jeffrey Epstein interacted sexually with 
19 minors? 
20 A. Again, you are asking me the same 
21 type of question exactly but with different 
22 language. Again, my only knowledge of 
23 somebody who claims these things that I have 
24 personal knowledge of is Virginia. Virginia

4 did or didn't do because if Virginia is the 


3 example of what that story is and everything 


6 she said is false, so everything that leads

6 she was driven by her father to Palm Beach.

19 What part of that meeting was an 
20 obvious lie?

23 she was or wasn't or where she was or wasn't, 


24 they have all changed. She was either front

2 A. No. I did not state that at all, 
3 you are mischaracterizing my words and what I 
4 said. 
3 What I said was that we can all 


6 agree and I think at this point there is not 


7 one person in this room, however much you 
8 would like her to be younger, to say she was 
9 not 17 because that has been a very offensive 


10 thing that you have all done. So she was 17. 


1 At 17 you are allowed to be a professional 


12 masseuse and as far as I'm concerned, she was 
13 a professional masseuse. There is nothing 

14 inappropriate or incorrect about her coming 
15 at that time to give a massage. Her entire 
16 characterization of her first time at the 

17 house was to me an obvious lie, given it was 
18 impossible for her entire story to take place 
19 given I was speaking to her mother the entire 


20 she was at the house. 

Al. Q. So it was impossible that day, that 
22 first day she came and you were speaking to 
23 the mother, for Virginia Roberts to have had 
24 sex with Jeffrey Epstein during the time that 


25 you were outside with her mother?

4 you in your court papers that took place 


3 because those allegedly according to her lies 


6 involved some aspect of me.

14 let's take the next time she comes.

17 you have put out is based on this first 

18 appalling story that was written, repeated, 
19 multiply by the press that lied about her

3 borne out of years of feeling the pressure of 
4 this entire lie that she has perpetrated from 
3 our first time and whilst I recognize that

8 that terrible story has been told and retold 


9 and rehashed when I know it to be 100 percent

14 in a massage with her in Jeffrey Epstein's

16 for were professional and adult.

20 USVI under the age of 18?

8 responsible for finding professional people 
9 to work in the homes, age appropriate adult 


10 people, so from pool attendants, to 
11 gardeners, to chefs, to housekeepers, to 


12 butlers, to chauffeurs and one of the

2 A. The process -- 

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

10 completely empty and you physically observe him

Oe And then some of the remaining messages, 
"Johanna, work Sunday at 4 p.m.; A, Monday after 
school; left message for Courtney W and NT," are 
these individuals that you later learned were 
underaged girls that had been to Jeffrey Epstein's 
home? 

MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and 

foundation. 

THE WITNESS: That's correct. 

BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. What types of documents do you remember 
retrieving from the trash pulls from Jeffrey 
Epstein's home? 

A. There was numerous items. It was a lot of 
handwritten notes on different -- different pads of 
paper. Some of the pads had names on it, whether it 
was Epstein, whether it was Ghislane Maxwell, 
whether it was -- there were phone messages. 

When I say "phone messages," I mean, you 
know, the kind that come in a book. They are carbon 
copied, so the yellow copy always stays with the 
book, but the white copy is torn off. So there was 


always a carbon copy of the actual phone message.

8 Ox How did you know that? 

9 A. The computers had been removed from the 
10 home. 
Li Q. How did you know the computers were 
12 removed? 
13 A. Based on -- based on the dangling wires 


14 left behind, the monitors left, but the actual CPU 


15 of it was missing. 

16 When you went into the bedroom of Jeffrey 
17 Epstein, everything was removed from the -- the 
18 shelves, from the armoire. 

19 Q. Did you find nude photographs of girls? 
20 A. Yes.

10 THE WITNESS: Some of the items that were

2 even Nadia. And what I found very repulsive, 
3 out of the ordinary, was Nadia was wearing a 
4 swimsuit that was very revealing and 


3 basically, her bottom basically went up her 


6 butt, revealing all of her buttocks. So 


i again, in the context not very appropriate 
8 for the situation. 
9 O's Could you tell the relationship of 


10 age between the three girls that you have 


11 described and Nadia, for instance? 

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form 
13 and foundation. 

14 A. Nadia seemed to be a bit older, I 
15 would say. 

16 Q. How does this end, or is there, 

17 what do you do next? How does this meeting 
18 that you've just described break up? 

19 A. I asked to excuse myself and asked 
20 where the bathroom was, so I'm pointed inside 
21 the house, to go inside the house to the 

22 bathroom. 

23 I walk in there, and I walk, as I'm 


24 walking to the bathroom, what caught my eye, 


25) and I had to take a double lock, there were

2 pictures of naked women, half-dressed girls. 
3 So I went to the bathroom, again, from 
4 someone, myself working in private service, I 
3 always know in houses there are cameras, so 
6 again, I was very reluctant to stare, because 
a you never know when you are on camera. 
8 So I used the bathroom, and I came 


9 out, and you know, curiosity got the best of 
10 me, and I leaned over and started looking at 
11 these pictures for a brief minute, and it was 
12 just so coincidental that as I did that, Ms. 
13 Maxwell enters, and she immediately says to 
14 me that Jeffrey would like for me to rejoin 
15 the party immediately. 

16 Or. How many pictures of nude females 


AT did you see in Jeffrey Epstein's home? 


18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form 
19 and foundation. 

20 Ay I can't recall the exact number. 
21 Oi Can you describe the pictures that 


22 you saw in terms of what the people, what the 
23 people or person within the picture was 
24 wearing, what the age range would be of the 


25 person that's in the photograph, any poses,

3 perception was correct? 
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection. 
D A. It was younger. Yes; I «did: 
6 Or. How old was this girl? 
7 A. 15 years old. 
8 Q. What happens next when Ghislaine 


9 Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein and a 15-year-old 


10 girl walk into Eva Anderson's home? 

1 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form. 
12 Foundation. 

13 A. They proceed into the dining room 
14 area, which is across from the living room 
15 area. I go into the kitchen and I hear a 

16 conversation start. Very muffled, I could 


17 not hear any particulars about the 


18 conversation whatsoever. 

19 My wife and I are in the kitchen 

20 preparing the evening meal. Eva brings the 
21 young girl into the kitchen. In the kitchen, 
22 there is an island with three barstools. Eva 


23 instructs the young girl to sit to the 
24 furthest barstool on the right. 


25 ‘Oo. Describe for me what the girl

2 looked like, including her demeanor and 
3 anything else you remember about her when she 
4 walks into the kitchen. 
3 A. Very attractive, beautiful young 
6 girl. Makeup, very put together, casual 
7 dress. But she seemed to be upset, maybe 


8 distraught, and she was shaking, and as she 

9 sat down, she sat down and sat in the stool 
10 exactly the way the girls that I mentioned to 
1 you sat at Jeffrey's house, with no 

12 expression and with their head down. But we 
13 could tell that she was very nervous. 

14 Q. What do you mean by distraught and 


15 shaking, what do you mean by that? 


16 A. Shaking, I mean literally 

17 quivering. 

18 Or What happens next? 

19 A. We were, again, the absurdity, 

20 never introduced. Like you would walk into a 
21 room and say this is -- so my wife and I are 


22 in the kitchen and this young girl is sitting 


23 there. It was a very uncomfortable moment. 
24 I look at my wife. And so I want to ease the 
25 moment, and so I introduced myself and I

2 introduced my wife, and she doesn't really 
3 respond. 
4 And I asked her, are you okay? And 


3 she doesn't really respond. Nothing verbal, 
6 no cues, her head is still down. I ask her 
7 if she would like some water, tissue, 


8 anything, and she basically doesn't respond. 


9 Ors You ask her for a tissue? 

10 A. If she would like a tissue or some 
1. water at the time. 

12 Q. Was she crying at the time? 

13 A. My perception, she was on the verge 


14 of crying. And I'm trying to loosen the 

15 situation every way I know how, so the only 
16 way I knew how, and I thought maybe this will 
17 comfort her, I said oh, by the way, do you 


18 work for Jeffrey. 


19 And she says that, I guess kind of 
20 made her feel comfortable, because maybe it 
21 was that comment or my persistence, and she 


22 said yes. So I said, what do you do? And 


23 she says I'm Jeffrey's executive assistant, 
24 personal assistant. Which, from looking at 
25 her, just didn't seem to suit.

2 And I blurted out: You're his 
3 executive personal assistant? What do you 
4 do? And she says I was hired as his 
3 executive personal assistant. I schedule his 
6 appointments. 
7 And I'm shocked, and I blurt out: 


8 You seem quite young, how did you get a job? 
9 How old are you? And she says to me, point 
10 blank: I'm 15 years old. 

11 And I said to her: You're 15 years 
12 old and you have a position like that? At 

13 that point she just breaks down hysterically, 
14 so I feel like I just said something wrong, 
15 and she will not stop crying. My wife and I 
16 were at a loss for words, and I keep on 

17 trying to console her, and nothing I was 

18 saying, are you all right, do you needa 

19 tissue, do you need water, consoles her. 

20 And then in a state of shock, she 
21. just lets it rip, and what she told me was 


22 just unbelievable.

2 A. She proceeds to tell my wife and I 
3 that, and this is not -- this is blurting 
4 out, not a conversation like I'm having a 
3 casual conversation. That quickly, I was on 
6 an island, I was on the island and there was 
a Ghislaine, there was Sarah, she said they 
8 asked me for sex, I said no. 
9 And she is just rambling, and I'm 
10 like what, and she said -- I asked her, I 
1: said what? And she says yes, I was on the 
12 island, I don't know how I got from the 
13 island to here. Last afternoon or in the 
14 afternoon I was on the island and now I'm 
15 here. And I said do you have a -- this is 
16 not making any sense to me, and I said this 
17 is nuts, do you have a passport, do you have 
18 a phone? 
19 And she says no, and she says 
20 Ghislaine took my passport. And I said what, 
21 and she says Sarah took her passport and her 
22 phone and gave it to Ghislaine Maxwell, and 
23 at that point she said that she was 
24 threatened. And I said threatened, she says

3 And I'm just shocked. So the

D on, again, like I said, how she got here, she 
6 doesn't know how she got here. Again, I 
ah asked her, did you contact your parents and 
8 she says no. 
9 At that point, she says I'm not 


10 supposed to talk about this. I said, but I 


1 said: How did you get here. I don't 
12 understand. We were totally lost for words. 
13 And she said that before she got 


14 there, she was threatened again by Jeffrey 


15 and Ghislaine not to talk about what I had 


16 mentioned earlier, about -- again, the word 
1.7 she used was sex. 

18 Or And during this time that you're

Is it, if you came to know that person -- 

A. Uh-huh. 

Q. -- as a frequent flyer passenger, you

initial at some point? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection. 
THE WITNESS: Well, we don't really have a 
frequent flyer program that we do, so to speak. 
A lot of times I would do it because if you 
would write out everybody's name there is not 


enough space, you know, to get everybody's name 


in that little square there.

A. What were the years again? 

Q. The years of this book, 1995 -- 

A. I wouldn't say through 2013. But, yes, 
95 through 2000 sometime. Probably, I would have 
to go back and -- well, you can see in there. 

Q. We will get to it. 

A. There will be a point where you don't see 
her much. But to say it went through 2013 would not 


be accurate. 
Q. Let's do it this way: The person that you 


have reflected on numerous notations --

first and last name?

What does that mean?

Q. How many passengers would that Gulfstream

A. Twelve passengers, I believe. 
Q. And do you know how Jeffrey Epstein, 


Ghislaine Maxwell, Adam Perry Lang, and Virginia get 
off of St. Thomas or leave the island? 

Re No. I do not. Probably a charter, I'm 
guessing. 

Q. If -- who would fly the -- well, is there 
any other plane that Jeffrey Epstein was able to 
access back then that was a private plane? 

MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to foundation. 
THE WITNESS: No. At that point in time 
we don't have the Boeing yet. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 

Q. So how many airplanes did Jeffrey Epstein 
back then? 

A. Well, we -- I don't know if we had the 421 
then. We may or may not have. But it wouldn't -- 


you know, you wouldn't be flying the 421 down to 


St. Thomas with Jeffrey. It is too long of a 
flight. 

Q. The Cessna? 

A. The Cessna 421, correct.

Q. Yeah. It shows up on the next page. We 
will get there. 

A. Does it? Okay. 

So then, yes, the answer is, yeah, we 
still had the airplane. But we wouldn't have used 
that. 

Q. So is there any way of telling how Jeffrey 


Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Adam Perry Lang, and 
Virginia were in the Virgin Islands on that, from 
December 14th, 2000 -- 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to foundation. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. -- based on your knowledge or your logs or 


anything else? 


A. No, I wouldn't have any way of knowing. 
Q. Okay. 
A. Because the next flight that they are on 
was like this Palm Beach one, January 16th. So I 


wouldn't have any idea. 
Q. Okay. To your knowledge, did Jeffrey 


Epstein ever fly commercially?

A. He probably has. Back then at this time, 
I'm going to say probably not. But I know that he 
has flown commercially. But usually that would be 
like going to Europe, maybe. 

Q. Okay. January 16th through the 25th, 


those flights, do you see that block that I'm 
talking about? 

Re ¥es,. 

Q. Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy 
Tayler, and then at times Shelly Lewis, do you see 
that?

Q. The 25th it lands in Teterboro. And the 
next day, on the 26th, leaves out of Teterboro with 


Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy Tayler, and 


Virginia Roberts. This time you wrote the whole 
name. 

A. Right. Right. 

Q. So when you write the full name, does that 
signify -- that's when you may have learned her last 
name? 

A. Correct. 

Q. And do you know how she -- how she got up 


to New Jersey or New York?

time we landed at Cahokia with passengers on board. 

Q. What was the problem? 

A. We had a -- we had a static line that had 
cracked and it was causing our altimeters to not 
agree. And then we went to the alternate system, 
things got really worse because it was stopped up 
with a mud dauber somewhere in the system. That is 
why I remember that flight. 

Q. When you landed in St. Louis did the 


passengers get off the plane? 


A. Yes. And then they airlined -- I believe 
they airlined. They could have taken a charter, I 
don't recall. But I know they didn't leave with us.

to take it into Teterboro. 

Q. So while you had the Gulfstream, it seemed 
like Teterboro?

hours, four hours, maybe.

3 a little book store. And I remember she bought, I 
6 think, five pairs of reading glasses because she 

cf thought Jeffrey would like them. He had them all 
8 over the house. On every table there was reading

2 suggesting a photo, and they told us to go get 
3 on the couch. And so Andrew and Virginia sat

D her that he had taken this girl's virginity, the

9 Jeffrey?

AT you were testifying earlier that Jeffrey told you a

Q Do you remember there being a job posting that 
you felt like was appropriate for Virginia or did you just 
go out and talk to the woman who ran the spa area on your 
own? 

A I just talked to Angela. 

Q Okay. Do you recall whether this was intended 
to be a full-time job? 

A I don't remember if it was full time or just 
summer jobs or, you know, during season. It was probably 
for a season because Mar-a-Lago is seasonal. 

I mean, I was there year round but a lot of 
people are seasonal, you know, because it's like 
snowbirds, you know, summertime comes and nobody wants to 
be down in south Florida. 

Q What would you call the season, the seasonal 
aspect of Mar-a-Lago? What's the season? 

A Probably from September or October to, you know, 


maybe May, I guess. 


Q Is that the coolest time? 
A Times of the year, yes. 
Q And it's more guests that come during that 


period of time? 
A Yes. 
Q And is there more staff brought on during that 


period of time?

A We've got to call her something, but, you know, 
I didn't really know what her job title was, but I was 
glad that they would give her a job. 

Q Right. 

A You know, and that, you know, I was hoping she 
would be happy; that way she could, you know, go back and 


forth to work with me. She didn't have to drive or 


nothing.

I just don't remember. 
Q Do you remember whether Virginia wore a uniform?

Q So you don't know if it was a couple days or a 
couple weeks or a couple months or a couple years? 
Anything in that -- 

A Well, it wasn't a couple years. It might have 
been two weeks to two months. I don't know. It wasn't a 
whole long time, you know. 

QO Where were you when Virginia told you she might 
be going to try to get this other job? 

A Probably at work. She might have told me, like, 
at lunch or whatever. I don't remember. That was so many 
years ago. I just remember she said Ms. Maxwell was going 
to, you know, get her a job with Jeffrey Epstein and learn 
massage therapy. And I thought, well, that's great, you 
know, because learning new jobs is all about life, you 
know. 

You've got to learn each -- you know, I've 
learned a lot of different things over my lifetime so it's 
good to learn every new job you can because that can help 
you later in life and that's what I think I told her. 

Q Okay. So the best you can recall today is you 
had a conversation with her sometime at lunch perhaps at 
Mar-a-Lago where she told you she was going to try to get 
another job? 

A Yes. And I thought that was a good thing. 


Q Do you know now that you recall that, what

daughter's boyfriend. 

Q Why didn't you care for Michael? 

A I didn't think anybody was good enough for my 
daughter but that's just me. 

Q I suspect you're right about all fathers. 

Do you remember her telling you anything about 


what her job with Mr. Epstein was going to be or was? 


A She said it was going to be massage therapy. 

Q Okay. Did she tell you she was getting some 
training? 

A Yes. 

Q Did she tell you about the training? 

A No. She just said she was being trained in

right, were approximately 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.?

was working there? 

MR. EDWARDS: Form. 

THE WITNESS: She didn't work that long. 

MS. MENNINGER: Okay. 

THE WITNESS: Like I say, it was more, like, 

a couple of weeks. It wasn't -- 

BY MS. MENNINGER: 

Q Well, earlier you testified it, might have been 
a couple of months? 

A Well, you know, for me, two weeks, two months, I 
mean, I don't even remember how long I worked at 
Mar-a-Lago. I told you I worked there six years and 
according to them, it was, like, three years. Seemed like 
Six. 

Q Well, earlier you testified that Mar-a-Lago was 
more of a seasonal place, correct? 

A Yes, well, it is seasonal. But I mean, they 
could be open up the spa area during the summer too 
because I'm sure a lot of people in Palm Beach come to get 


massages and things like that. I mean, you know, the only

part they close off is where the chefs and all that, where 
they didn't do any more big events and stuff. 

Q Okay. 

A But I think the kitchen was still open. I mean, 
they had a dining room. 

Q So if she didn't work there that long 
August 2000 -- even though August is in the summer -- it 
would not be unusual in your mind? 

A No. 

Q Okay. So she could have started working in 
August of 2000, correct? 

A She could have, yeah. 

Q And while you don't think she worked all the way 
until September of 2001 -- 

A No. 

Q -- that would be consistent with your 
recollection of it being more seasonal in the fall, 
September -- 

MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
BY MS. MENNINGER: 

QO So if she worked in the fall, September, 
October, something like that, that seems likes that 
accords with your memory, correct? 


MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.

year, so it could have been -- I remember it was a very 
hard day because | had to wait in the sun outside in a

Ms. Maxwell told me to get him out. 
Q. Did she tell you why? 


A. No. She didn't -- I guess she didn't want to

6 didn't like working for Mrs. Maxwell? 

wi A. That's correct. 

8 Q. Can you tell me why,,.@ther than that she 

9 blamed you for everything? 

10 A. She came from a very wealthy family and she

iz that she was rotten spoiled and she tried to drive Lhe 
13 house like a palace and not a home. 

I was -- I discussed it with her, many, many 

Lb times we have discussions. And sometimes I even refuse 
16 to do her orders, knowing that I was going to he b ad 
17 up by Mr. Epstein or do the right thing, my thinking of 
18 running the house should be. But we neycr had a good 
29 relationship at all from the beginning, I don't think 
20 so. But I was -- have to be her driver amd she will go 
21 and shop all over the malls and I will have to go behind 
22 her, pay for it and bring the bags to the car. 

23 Next day or the same day she will do shopping 
24 and buy and say, John, go to this store and get it. It 
25 was a lot of work. It was a lot that she created and

1, A. I don't know what kind of business but she was 
2 the one who organized I would say employment with this

Expert Report of Professor Terry Coonan, J.D. 
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) 


Giuffre v. Maxwell 
Case No. 15-cv-07433-RWS 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page400 of 883 


international commercial dimensions of the sex trafficking scheme recounted by Ms. Giuffre. It 
is both factually and legally correct to characterize what Ms. Giuffre experienced as 
victimization in a sex trafficking conspiracy. 

Conclusion 4 


Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s account appears credible and consistent in its most salient parts 
with the testimony of other witnesses and with contemporary trends in U.S. sex trafficking. 


The description of exploitation recounted by Ms. Giuffre, while not the most common 
sex trafficking scenario (many cases involve even more brutal forms of pimp-driven prostitution) 
nonetheless is quite consistent with larger patterns of commercial sexual exploitation. The 
conspiracy in this case was premised upon the exploitation of minors and young women who 
seem to have had certain identifiable vulnerabilities that rendered them prone to exploitation. 
The criminal scheme that emerges from the depositions and police reports involved a very 
calculated pattern of recruiting, grooming, and an attempt to “normalize” the repeated 
exploitation of its victims. 

While the accounts of witnesses vary in some of their details, the essential elements of a 
sex trafficking conspiracy clearly emerge when viewed in the totality of the circumstances that 
are recounted in the case record. Ms. Giuffre refers to herself at times as a “‘sex slave.” This is 
not factually incorrect, given her experiences, though current U.S. law might prefer to 
characterize her as a victim of sex trafficking. Popular understandings of the term “sex slave” 
might still connote images of violent pimps, white slavery, or of victims chained to a bed ina 
brothel in the minds of some people. To call Ms. Giuffre a victim of sex trafficking would 
however very accurately convey the reality that she along with a great many other victims of 
contemporary forms of slavery are often exploited by the “invisible chains” of fraud and 


psychological coercion.

I. INTRODUCTION 

le I have been retained by the law firm of Farmer, Jaffe, Weissing, Edwards, Fistos 
& Lehrman, P.L. to provide expert analysis and opinion on behalf of Ms. Virginia Giuffre in 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, Plaintiff, v. GHISLAINE MAXWELL, Defendant. CASE NO. 1:15- 


cv-07433, which is pending in the United States District Court Southern District of New York. 


IL. QUALIFICATIONS 


2. I am a tenured, full professor at the College of Information Sciences and 
Technology at The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, where I have 
been employed since 2001. I am the Director of the Information Searching and Learning 
Laboratory at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at The Pennsylvania State 
University. I am also a principal scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute. I was a 
Senior Fellow at the Pew Internet & American Life Project, which is part of the Pew Research 
Center, from 2010 through 2012. I was also a University Expert at the National Ground 
Intelligence Center from 2011 through 2014. Prior to my employment at The Pennsylvania State

in the past 10 years, is attached as Appendix A. 

5; My fields of professional expertise include web analytics, search engines, web 
searching, social media, online advertising, and related areas. In the course of my academic career, 
Ihave worked with a variety of search engines and information searching applications in order to 
understand user searching behavior on the Web and other environments. For example, as part of 
my Master’s program in computer science, I designed and coded a text-based search engine. For 
my Doctorate program in computer science, I developed a program interface for Web search 
engines and implemented it on the Gigabyte search engine. In subsequent research, I have worked 
with the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and Verity commercial searching systems. 

6. Concerning user searching behaviors on the Web using web analytics, I have 
worked directly with real-user searching data from several search engines, including AOL, Alta 
Vista, Dogpile, Excite, and MSN Live. I’ve also analyzed web data of visitor traffic and other 
attributes from a variety of websites and social media platforms. I’ve analyzed real-user data from 
online search marketing campaigns and user referral traffic to websites. I have conduct research 


and teaching concerning aspects of websites and social media platforms, including keyword 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page405 of 883 


advertising. I’ve developed web analytics models and processes for analysis of business goals, 
and I have used web analytics data and commercial tools in both my research and teaching. I’ve 
also conducted other research on user searching and related online behaviors. I have advised 
governmental agencies and companies in consulting and expert witnessing matters. A list of cases 
in which I have testified as an expert in deposition or trial in the past four years is attached as 
Appendix B. I am being compensated for my work on this case at the rate of $300 per hour. 


Ill. ASSIGNMENT AND MATERIALS CONSIDERED 


7. In providing my expert opinion, I have been asked to respond to the following 
question: 
8. What is the dissemination of the statements from Ms. Maxwell referring to 


Ms. Giuffre’s declarations as “untrue” and “lies” from when the statements were made on 2 
January 2015 to the date that I filed this report? 

9. For brevity, I refer to references to the statements denoting Ms. Giuffre’s 
declarations as “untrue” and “lies”, any related accounts referring to those original statements, or 
similar statements from Ms. Maxwell or her representatives referring to Ms. Giuffre as the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, the statements from Ms. Maxwell’s message, or the message 
from Mr. Gow'. 

10. My analysis is based on my experience, training, knowledge, and education and is 
formed through the application of that experience, training, knowledge, and education in the 
principles of web data collection, web analytics, web search, search engines, web sites, web traffic 
analysis, and related market analysis. 


IT, The materials that I considered in preparing this report are listed in Appendix C.

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page406 of 883 


IV. SUMMARY OF OPINIONS 

12. Based on my research and analysis in connection with this assignment, which is 
described in more detail in the body of this report, along with my own experience, training, 
knowledge, and education as stated below, I have reached the following opinion: 

13. The statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to at least 
115 online media or other sites in 178 separate stories or articles with a combined 
66,909,965 potential unique visitors since 2 January 2015 to the date that I filed this report, 
inclusive. 

14. This is a conservative estimate, and it is more likely than not, the statements made 
by Ms. Maxwell against Ms. Giuffre have received wider dissemination due to factors such as: 

a. l used a set of online websites to measure dissemination, and it is 
reasonable that I have not located all references to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre on 
every website by the time of the submission of this report. 

db. I examined only online sources referencing the statements made against 
Ms. Giuffre and not print or broadcast media dissemination of the statements made against Ms. 
Giuffre. 

c. Ihave not attempted to measure face-to-face dissemination of articles 
containing the statements against Ms. Giuffre. 

d. I do not have access to certain online sources where articles containing the 
statements against Ms. Giuffre may have been disseminated (e.g., email messages, personal 
social media messages, articles behind firewalls, etc.). 

e. There are possibly sites that have hosted the statements made against Ms. 


Giuffre that I could not locate or where the statements have been removed. 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page407 of 883 


f, There are sites that hosted the articles containing the statements made 
against Ms. Giuffre where the visitor data is not accessible or where I could not confirm the 
number of visitors. 

g. I did not consider the dissemination via social media platforms of articles 
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. 

h. Many sites published multiple articles on multiple days that contained or 
referenced the statements made against Ms. Giuffre; however, I did not include these multiple 
publication dates in calculating unique daily visitors. 

i I did not include unique daily visitors to articles that link from that article 
to one or more of the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. 

i. Finally, I did not include the counts of those who may have been searching 
and seen the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the search results listing. 

Vv. BACKGROUND WEB ANALYTICS FOR TRAFFIC ANALYSIS 

15: In the course of forming this opinion, I implemented numerous web analytics and 
related techniques commonly used in the industry. In order to more clearly discuss these 
techniques, I define the following terms: 

. Direct Traffic: visitors to a website that come from entering a website link 
into a browser location bar (e.g., not coming via a link on another website). 

. Dissemination: the act of spreading or the circulation of information or 
articles. 

. Domain: a specific Internet website that are administered as a unit and 


defined by an Internet Protocol (IP) address. 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page408 of 883 


. Reach: the percentage or number of people who visit a website out of the 
total targeted population. 

. Referral Traffic: visitors to a site that come from websites other than 
search engines. 

. Repeat Visits: visitor traffic to a website in a given period that just includes 
multiple visits from the same set of IP addresses (i.e., IP addresses with more than one visit); 
provides a count of the people who have visited a site more than once in a given period. An 
individual is usually defined by a combination of IP address and browser within a given period but 
can also be defined by more sophisticated methods. 

. Search Engine: a program and associated hardware and processes that 
allows people to find information on the Web, typically via the submission of queries consisting 
of terms. 

. Search Traffic: visitors to a site that come from search engines rather than 
from other websites or via direct navigation. 

. Search: a submission of a query to a search engine, usually in the form of 
terms forming a query. 

. Share: sharing of an article or webpage typically via some social media 


platform. 





. Social M content that is shared via a social networking website. 
. Unique Visits: visitor traffic to a website within a given period that includes 


only the first visit (i.e., subsequent visits are ignored), which excludes repeat visits; provides a 


count of the individuals who have visited a site in a given period. 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page409 of 883 


. Unique Daily Visitors: visitor traffic to a website who visits a site at least 
once in a given 24-hour period. Each visitor, to the site, is counted once during the reporting period, 
which means it excludes repeat visits; provides a count of the individuals who have visited a site 
on a given day. 

° Visits: a count of all the traffic to a website in a given period, including both 
unique and repeat visits. 

. Web Analytics: the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of web 
data. 

VI. METHODOLOGY 

16. I was asked to determine the dissemination of articles containing the statements 
made against Ms. Giuffre. 

17. In forming my opinion, I utilized accepted web analytics and related 
methodologies in developing my assessment. 

18. To that end, I employed various publicly available online analytic services, as well 


as some subscription-based services in conducting my research, including: 


. Alexa: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis. 
. Compete: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis. 
. Google Keyword Tool: an online service that provides the number of 


searches for a given set of keywords in a given month on the Google search engine. 

. Google Trends: an online service that shows how often a particular term is 
relatively searched on the Google search engine in a given period. 

. SimiliarWeb: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis. 

. SpyFu: an online service providing search data and analytics, including for 
both paid (i.e., advertisements) and organic (i.e., natural or algorithmic) channels. 


. W3Snoop: an online service that provides web traffic data and analysis. 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page410 of 883 


19. These tools offer a variety of data and analysis services, and they are frequently 
utilized by industry professionals in the search engine optimization, web analytics, and search 
engine marketing fields for market, customer, and competitive analysis. Furthermore, where 
possible, I did my own assessments, as outlined below, in order to validate the data and analysis 
results. 

20. I also utilized search engines, primarily Google and Bing, to assess the 
dissemination of articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. 

21. Whenever possible, I used multiple data sources, which is a data verification 
technique known as triangulation”, where one uses multiple and disparate sources for analysis 
and then compare the results from the separate analysis. If the results are similar, it reinforces 
the conclusion that the overall data analysis is valid. 

22. In all of my assessments, I have used the most conservative numbers, meaning 
that I use the smallest value in arriving at the dissemination of articles containing the statements 
made against Ms. Giuffre. If I had not employed this conservative estimate, the number of 
potential dissemination of the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre would 
be 102,740,816 (i.e., more than 102 million) daily unique visitors. 

23. In situations where I believed that I could not adequately verify the number of 
individuals or did not have confidence in the numbers in those situations, I did not include those 
numbers in the calculation of daily unique visitors. 

24. My analysis is based on my experience, training, knowledge, and education and is 


formed through the application of that experience, training, knowledge, and education in the 


? Triangulation (social science) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_%28social_science%29

principles of web data collection, web analytics, web search, search engines, web sites, and 
related areas. 


VII. DISSEMINATION OF THE STATEMENTS MADE AGAINST MS. GIUFFRE 





25. My opinion is that articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre 
have been disseminated to at least 115 online media and others sites in 178 separate stories or 
articles with a combine 66,909,965 unique daily visitors. 

26. This is a conservative estimate, and it is more likely than not, the statements have 
received wider dissemination due to factors such as: 

a. lused a set of online websites (115) to calculate the dissemination of 
articles, and it is reasonable that I have not located all references to the statements made against 
Ms. Giuffre by the time of the submission of this report. So, there may be more sites with 
articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre that are not included in my 
calculations. 

db. My focus of analysis was the online dissemination of the statements made 
against Ms. Giuffre. Therefore, I examined only online sources and not dissemination of the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre via print or broadcast media. It is reasonable to assume that 
the statements made against Ms. Giuffre were disseminated via these other channels. 

c. Ihave not attempted to measure face-to-face dissemination of the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre. Therefore, these sources of dissemination are not included 
in the count of daily unique visitors. 

d. I did not have access to certain online sources where the statements 


against Ms. Giuffre may have been disseminated (e.g., email messages, social media messages, 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page412 of 883 


articles behind firewalls, etc.). Therefore, these sources are not included in the count of daily 
unique visitors. 

e. There may be sites that have hosted articles containing the statements 
made against Ms. Giuffre where the articles have been removed. Therefore, I did not include 
these sites in my calculation of the unique daily visitors. 

f. There are sites where the visitor data is not accessible or where I could not 
reasonably check the number of visitors. In these cases, even though I had confirmed the site 
had posted one or more articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not 
include these sites in my calculation of the unique daily visitors. 

g. I did not consider the dissemination via social media platforms of articles 
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. 

h. Many sites published multiple articles on multiple days that contain or 
reference the statements made against Ms. Giuffre; however, I did not use these multiple articles 
from the same site with different publication dates in my calculations in determining the number 
of daily unique visitors who have been exposed to the articles containing the statements made 
against Ms. Giuffre. 

i I did not include articles that link to one or more of the articles containing 
the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. Unless the article directly referenced the statements 
made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not include it in my analysis. 

i Finally, I did not include people who may been searching and may have 
seen the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the search results, without needing to visit the 


actual articles posted on the websites.

VIII. METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE DISSEMINATION OF THE 





STATEMENTS MADE AGAINST MS. GIUFFRE 

27. Ihave been informed that the statements made against Ms. Giuffre were 
originally contained in an email message from Mr. Ross Gow’, of Acuity Reputation, acting on 
behalf of Ms. Maxwell, that was sent on 2 January 2015 at 8:38 pm‘ to, based on the email 
addresses*, people at The Mail Online®, The Independent’, The Mirror®, The Times’, and the 
BBC". The email message from Mr. Gow contained the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. A 
screen shot of the email message is shown in Figure 1.

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts ~50 not a new Individual. The allegations made by Victoria 
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have 
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue, 


Each time the story Is re told It changes with new salacious details about public figures and 
world leaders and now itis alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz Is involved in having 
sexual relations with her, which he denies. 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as 
they are defamatory 


Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same. 
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the Britisly 
press and elsewhere and reserves her right t seek redress at the repetition of such old 
defamatary claims.

29. I have been informed that the statements made against Ms. Giuffre were 
confirmed by Ms. Maxwell in a news article and video!! aired on 5 January 2015, which I have 


established by reviewing the video referenced in the news article!”.

30. Additionally, on 8 January 2015, agents reportedly acting on behalf of Ms. 
Maxwell made statements that the allegations against her were a “web of lies and deceit”!, 
which are similar to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the message from Mr. Gow. 

31. Similarly, on 1 February 2015, like statements were quoted as “These allegations 
are untrue and defamatory”'+, which are similar to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in 
the message from Mr. Gow. 

32. Based on my investigation and research, news stories, articles, and postings 
containing direct reference to or quotes from the statements made against Ms. Giuffre appeared 
the same day (i.e., 2 January 2015) as the email from Mr. Gow, with several news organizations 
and other sites publishing other articles containing direct reference to or quotes from the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the immediately following days. News articles 
containing direct reference to or quotes of the statements made against Ms. Giuffre have 
continued to appear in news articles and other postings nearly up to the date that I submitted this 
report. 

33. A timeline of events relating to the dissemination of the statements made against 
Ms. Giuffre is shown in Figure 2.

35: Concerning the procedure employed in determining the dissemination of the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, nearly every major news site!> that I investigated, along 
with other specific news sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, 
as well as other countries, have carried some aspects of the overall story related to Ms. Giuffre 
and/or Ms. Maxwell, or other parties involved. 

36. In fact, there are tens of thousands of news articles and postings concerning the 
general story from news outlets worldwide, with combined potential viewership in the multi- 


millions, as searches on the major search engines, such as Google and Bing, show. 





'S Including the largest online news sites, such as Yahoo! News, Google News, Huflington Post, CNN, NY Times, Fox News, NBC News, Daily 
Mail, Washington Post, The Guardian, Wall Street Journal, ABC News, BBC News, USA Today, LA Times (see

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page417 of 883 


37. However, I was not interested in news articles that just discussed the story in 
general or other aspects of the story. Also, I was not interested in those articles where Ms. 
Maxwell or those acting on her behalf, such as Mr. Gow, would just generally deny the 
allegations in the complaint'*. I was specifically interested in only those articles that referenced 
directly or quoted the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the 2 January 2015 email message 
from Mr. Gow, Ms. Maxwell’s subsequent confirmation of the statements, or similar statements 
as those in the message from Mr. Gow. Naturally, this narrow focus is a smaller subset of news 
articles than are the articles addressing the overall story. 

38. To isolate these articles of interest, I generated a series of 10 queries!” that 
specifically targeted news articles from the case that addressed the statements made against Ms. 
Maxwell (e.g., Ghislaine Maxwell obvious lies) to retrieve a set of articles that directly related to 
the statements made against Ms. Giuffre!*. I employed a modified snowball technique”, starting 
with one seed query, adding and modifying terms, until I was not retrieving new results. I also 
located some articles via navigating from the set of retrieved articles. 

39. I set the search range date from 2 January 2015 onward, so articles prior to that 
date were not included in the search results. For each article used in my analysis, I also verified 
the date that the article was published to ensure it was published on or after 2 January 2015 and 
that the articles directly referenced in some way the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.

New York Daily News - Sep 21, 2015 
Ghislaine Maxwell, after walking out the side door of her E65St. 
townhouse in ... cites statements by Maxwell's spokesman calling 
Giuffre's claims “obvious lies.” 
42. I then personally verified that each article, by reviewing each article, used in my 


analysis directly referenced in some way the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. 


43. So, articles relating to the overall story that did not mention Ms. Maxwell’s 


statements made against Ms. Giuffre were not included in the analysis. Articles relating to the 


overall story that referred to Ms. Maxwell simply denying the charges were not included. 


44. Talso personally performed a site search” 


of the top 15 online media sites 


worldwide”! of articles related to the case, and I reviewed the results to identify if any of these

articles referred to the statements against Ms. Giuffre. I also did the same for many country- 
specific news sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. 

45. In the end, I had a set of 178 online news and other articles from 2 January 2105 
to the date that I filed this report that specifically referenced the statements made against Ms. 
Giuffre to conduct my analysis, as outlined below. 

46. Each of these 178 online articles was posted online. The 178 online articles were 
distributed among 115 unique domain websites (i.e., some websites posted multiple articles that 
contain the statements made against Ms. Giuffre). These 115 domains are:

Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page422 of 883 


47. As seen from the list of domains that have published articles or stories containing 
references to the statement made against Ms. Giuffre, many of these domains are those of major 
news organizations or sources, including AOL News, BBC, Huffington Post, International 
Business Times, Irish Times, MSN News, National Enquirer, New York Daily News, New 
Zealand Herald, Page Six, Radar Online, Reuters, The Daily Beast, The Daily Mail, The 
Express, The Guardian, The Mirror, The Sun, The Telegraph, Yahoo! News, etc. 

48. I then used a variety of web analytics traffic services and other sources to get the 
unique daily visitor traffic for each of these domains. I used multiple services when available to 
verify the unique daily visitor traffic for each of these domains, as these traffic services may use 
different techniques to arrive at their traffic numbers. 

49. In cases of conflicting unique daily visitor traffic numbers, I utilized the most 
conservative (i.e., smallest) number. 

50. In cases where I determined I could not get unique daily visitor traffic numbers or 
the unique daily visitor traffic were not reliable, in my opinion, I did not include the unique daily 
visitor traffic numbers for that domain in the numbers. This usually occurred for the sites with a 
smaller number of daily visitors or sites with an extremely large number of daily visitors. 

51. Unique daily visitors measure is an industry standard web analytics metric for 
measuring people that visit a website in a given day, also known as unique audience’. It is 
generally averaged out over multiple days with a given period, such as week or month, as there 
are normal daily fluctuations. 

52. Table 1 shows the unique daily visitor traffic for the listed domains that posted 


articles or stories referencing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre and the associated unique

21 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page423 of 883 


daily visitor traffic for each of those domains, along with number of articles containing the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre posted on that site. 

3. Table 1: Domains that published articles or stories containing the statements 
made against Ms. Giuffre with the domain’s number of unique daily visitors and the 
number of articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre published on that 


domain from 2 January 2015 to the date that I filed this report”.

*~ Unique daily visitor traffic not available 
> _ Unique daily visitor traffic not verifiable 


54. Lused each domain’s unique daily visitor count to calculate the dissemination of 
the articles containing the statements against Ms. Giuffre to various websites and potentially to 
visitors to that site (i.e., as visitors to the news sites, these individuals could have been exposed 
to the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre), using the unique daily visitor 
number only once for each domain, regardless whether that domain published more than one 
article referring to the statements made against Ms. Giuffre. 

IX. RESULTS FOR ANALYSIS OF THE DISSEMINATION OF THE STATEMENTS 
MADE AGAINST MS. GIUFFRE 

55. Based on my analysis as outlined above, my opinion is that the statements against 
Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to at least 115 online media and other sites with 178 stories 
or articles with a combined 66,909,965 (more than 66 million) unique daily visitors traffic. 

56. [note that for many of the 178 articles containing the statements made against 
Ms. Giuffre, one could get gist of the story of the article directly from the article headline. I 


point this out as it is well known that people skim online news sites”*, so titles such as these 


™ Sce for example: Aikat, D. News on the web: usage trends of an on-line newspaper. Convergence: The Intemational Joumal of Research into 
New Media Technologies 4. 4 (Dec. 1998), 94-110. 


25 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page427 of 883 


would have substantial impact on visitors to that site. Examples of such articles headlines 
(examples of actual headlines from the 178 articles) are: 

. British socialite to face Epstein accuser's defamation lawsuit 

. Alleged Epstein madam denies calling teen ‘sex slave’ a liar 

. Sex-Trafficking Denials Aren't Libel, Brit Says 

. U.S. woman who claimed she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew 
sues British socialite for denying that she recruited her to be a sex slave 

. British 'madam' accused of recruiting teenage ‘sex slave' Virginia Roberts 
for Prince Andrew's friend Jeffrey Epstein denies calling her a liar 

. Ghislaine Maxwell denies calling Virginia Roberts a liar 

. Bill Clinton Pedophile Sex Scandal: Socialite Denies Calling ENQUIRER 
Source A Liar, Woman files defamation suit against British publishing magnate 

. Jeffrey Epstein sex slave accuser sues Brit socialite for defamation 

. Lawyers for British socialite accused of pimping ‘sex slave' to Jeffrey 
Epstein push to dismiss defamation lawsuit. 

57. This is a conservative estimate, and more likely than not, articles containing the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to more individuals. 
X. WHY THE ESTIMATE IS LOW 
58. This (66,909,965 individual unique daily traffic) is a conservative estimate, and it 

is more likely than not, the statements have received wider dissemination due to factors such as: 

a. Although I spend considerable effort to locate published articles that 
contained the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, it is reasonable to assume that I have not 


located all such articles by the time of the submission of this report. So, there are possibly more 


26 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page428 of 883 


sites with articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre that are not included in my 
calculations, which would increase the dissemination of the articles. 

b. The focus of my analysis was the dissemination of online articles 
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, and I examined only online sources and not 
print or broadcast media. Many of the media outlets that I did identify have consider print 
distribution®>, which are not included in my calculations, for example, such as: 

e The Sun (print circulation) 1,741,838 

e Daily Mail (print circulation) 1,562,361 

e The Daily Telegraph (print circulation) 472,936 

e The Times (print circulation) 402,752 

e The Guardian (print circulation) 161,152 

c. In my analysis, I did not attempt to measure face-to-face dissemination 
that may have occurred after individuals may have read articles containing the statements made 
against Ms. Giuffre, which would increase the count. 

d. Naturally, I could not access certain online sources where the statements 
made against Ms. Giuffre may have been disseminated (e.g., email messages, social media 
messages, articles behind firewalls, etc.). Therefore, these numbers are not included in my 
calculations. 

e. Also, there are possibly sites that have hosted articles containing the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre where the articles have been removed. Therefore, they are 


not included in my calculations.

27 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page429 of 883 


£ For sites where one or more of the articles containing the statements made 
against Ms. Giuffre are posted but where I could not locate or not determine reliable daily unique 
visitor traffic, I have not included these sites in my calculations. There are 59 (of the 115 sites, 
51.3%) where I could not get or not get verifiable traffic data. For example, the traffic numbers 
for the MSN News (Microsoft) and Yahoo! News are not separated by news and other services, 
such as search, so I did not include these in the number of people to which the articles containing 
the statements made against were disseminated. 

g. I did not include the dissemination of the articles containing the statements 
made against Ms. Giuffre directly to social media platforms. However, many of the articles 
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre do include counts of the number of times 
that individuals shared the article to a social media networks, as shown in Table 2. 

i. Table 2: Number of social media shares by published article 


containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre.

ii. As shown in Table 2, the articles containing the statements made against 
Ms. Giuffre have been shared 33,758 times, mostly on Facebook. 
iii. Given that the median number of Facebook ‘friends’ is 200°, this equates 


to a possible 6,751,600 individuals, in addition to the 33,758 individuals who originally shared

the articles, to which the articles containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre could have 
been disseminated, assuming these individuals are all unique and have not already read one of 
the articles. 

iv. However, I did not include these social media shares in my calculations. 

v. Since news article viewing follows a power law”’ distribution?®, there is no 
direct linear ratio of number of social media shares to readership. There is published research 
that does report average of views of an article on a news website and also average social media 
shares”’. In a direct calculation with numbers from this article*°, 23 articles views per social 
media share, using 33,758 social media shares, this would be 776,434 article views. However, 
this ratio would vary by website, number of daily unique visitors, type of news article, time for 
accumulating shares, and possibly other factors. Plus, this number would not account for the 
people receiving the social media share that viewed the title, post, and snippet but did not click 
on the share to view the article on the website, thereby undercounting views of the articles. 

vi. Also, given the topical nature of the underlying news story, one could 
expect lower social media sharing but higher article viewing, as people will tend to read articles 
on such topics privately but not share on social media*!. So, I would expect the social media 
number itself to be an undercount. 

h. I did not include articles that link to one of the articles containing the 


statements made against Ms. Giuffre in my calculations of dissemination. Unless the article

directly mentioned the statements made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not include that article in my 
calculations. So, unless the linking article actually mentioned, referenced, or quoted the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, I did not include it in the calculations. 

i Many sites published multiple articles on multiple days that quoted or 
referenced the statements made against Ms. Giuffre; however, I did not use these multiple 
publication dates from the same site in my calculations of unique visitor traffic. If a domain 
published only one article containing the statements against Ms. Giuffre, then I directly used the 
unique daily visitors number. If a domain published multiple articles concerning the statements 
against Ms. Giuffre, I did not count the traffic for the subsequent articles containing the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre, even though research shows that repeat traffic to websites 
is generally only about 30%”, meaning that 70% of the traffic would be unique. However, I was 
not comfortable using this figure given the natural of these sites, which might have higher repeat 
visitors day-to-day. Therefore, I did not include the unique visitors to multiple articles in my 
calculations. 

i. Finally, I did not include the count of people who may been searching and 
may have seen the statements made against Ms. Giuffre in the search results, without needing to 
visit the actual articles, as shown in Figure 4.

XI. ACCURACY OF THE TRAFFIC _NUMBERS _ AN 





DITIO! 





VERIFICATION 


32 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page434 of 883 


59. Concerning the accuracy of the analysis, the number of domains where the 
statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated is reliable, as this is straightforward 
to verify (i-e., the article is either posted on a site or it is not). If anything, this is an undercount, 
as some domains, for example, may have removed such articles, making them no longer 
available. There are possibly articles containing the statements that I have not been able to 
locate by the time that I submitted this report. 

60. Concerning traffic numbers for domains, a unique visitor is typically identified by 
an identifier stored in a text file, which is based on an individual computer’s browser, although 
more sophisticated methods are also being used. In locating traffic numbers for the domains, I 
used multiple services when available and attempted to verify via other sources. In case with 
varying traffic data, I utilized the most conservative (i.e., smallest) number available. 

61. Lalso verified findings from my analysis via other methods and my own 
experience and training. For example, there are periods of increased publishing of articles 
containing the statements made against Ms. Giuffre and related stories. One would expect, 
increases in associated searching during these periods. Using the Google Keyword Tool, which 
provides search volume for search queries by month, I examined search volume from January 
2015 to the date that I filed this report. There was an 54,518% increase in search volume for the 
keywords Virginia Giuffre Virginia Roberts Ghislaine Maxwell in January 2015, relative to the 
prior 7 months, in the US, and a 44,822% increase for the United Kingdom (UK) in January 
2015, relative to the prior 7 months. This is in line with the increase in posting of articles during 
the same month’. So, one sees the expected increase in searching for key terms based on the 


increase posting of articles. 


33 Note: use the US and the UK as sample countries since there are aspect of the story that relate to each country.

XII SUMMARY 

64. The statements made against Ms. Giuffre have been disseminated to at least 
115 online media or other sites in 178 separate stories or articles with a combined 
66,909,965 individual unique visitors from 2 January 2015 to the date that I filed this 
report, inclusive. More likely than not, this is a conservative estimate. 

65. Right to Amend: Although I have had access to materials publicly available 
pertaining to claims in this dispute, I have not been able to review all the material by the deadline 
for completion of this report. I reserve the right to review and rely on any such material, 
including at the time of trial. I also reserve the right to issue a supplemental or an amended 


report if my review of such material results in any significant change or addition to my opinion.

32. However, nowhere in his report does Mr. Anderson explain why these 26 search 
terms are important, beyond the fact that, he claims incorrectly, searching the major search 
engines with these phrases results in links to Web pages that contain allegedly defamatory 
material. However, this is true of literally thousands of different search phrases _ it’s a simple 
task to create search terms to match particular pages but he never explains why these 
particular 26 phrases are relevant. 
33. As I explain below in detail, Mr. Anderson’s testimony is unreliable because it is 


not based on sufficient facts or data, nor is it the product of reliable principles and methods. 


Rather, it is seriously flawed in a number of ways. 
1. Mr. Anderson’s Choice of Search Terms Is Arbitrary 


34. Mr. Anderson, in his report, provides a list of 26 search terms (Page 7) that appear 
to have been chosen in an arbitrary manner; furthermore, Mr. Anderson does not explain how 
these search terms are relevant to this case. Most of the examples are rarely if ever searched 
upon, and return few, if any, relevant results (that is, links to pages that discuss or recount 
Defendant’s alleged defamatory statements). 

35) Search terms are only relevant to this case if a searcher, wishing to find 
information about Plaintiff, would type the terms into a search engine. Mr. Anderson does not 
explain why such a person would type, for instance, the term victims refuse silence sex slave; in 
fact there seems no reason to believe that such a person would use this term. Why would 
someone wanting to research information about Plaintiff use the term virginia roberts lies, or 
virginia roberts ross gow? Mr. Anderson does not suggest any reason that somebody should use 
such terms. Indeed, these are terms unlikely to be used by anyone unfamiliar with this litigation 
or the fact that Defendant had denied Plaintiff's original allegations. These are not terms likely 


to be used by Mr. Anderson’s “casual searcher” (“I conducted an investigation to determine the 


Expert Report of Peter Kent Virginia L. Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell 


Case 18-2868, Document 283, 08/09/2019, 2628241, Page495 of 883 


106. However, this 3-step process (create pages, place them on Web sites, create links 
to the pages) is not very efficient, regardless of the fact that it is common in the ORM business. 
One should keep in mind that the primary goal of any business is maximizing profits, not 
efficiency. The 3-step process may be inefficient, but it has the advantage of increasing the 
income of ORM firms; rather than merely creating links, they can also charge for the creation 
and placement of Web pages. There is, however, an alternative strategy that some ORM firms in 


fact do use, as I describe later in this report. 


2. The Problems With Mr. Anderson’s Strategy 
107. Mr. Anderson’s strategy is unnecessarily expensive and complicated, for a 
number of reasons: 


« Mr. Anderson exaggerates the number of Web pages (780) that must be pushed down 
in the search results 


e Placing new Web pages on quality Web sites will be very difficult, and unnecessary 


« Pushing the new Web pages up in the search results will be very difficult 


a) Mr. Anderson Exaggerates the Number of Web Pages (780) 
That Must Be Pushed Down In The Search Results 


108. Mr. Anderson has stated that 780 Web pages must be pushed down in the search 
results; he takes his 26 search phrases, and multiplies by 30 results (in theory 10 results per 
search-result page, over three pages, in order to push the “offending” pages down to the fourth 
page, though in some cases, in particular on Google, there may actually be fewer results on the 


first page, perhaps 8 or 9.) This is wrong for various reasons. 


Most of the Search Terms Will be Used Infrequently If Ever 


109. As noted earlier, most of Mr. Anderson’s 26 search terms are infrequently if ever 
employed by searchers. Why, for instance, would it be necessary to push down offending Web 
pages in the results that the search engines provide for the term victims refuse silence sex slave, 


when this term is likely never used (and furthermore, that the search results contain no

Ross Gow 
ACUITY Reputation 


Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria 
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have 
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue. 


Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and 
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having 
sexual relations with her, which he denies. 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as 
they are defamatory. 


Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same. 
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British 
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old 
defamatory claims.

IDENTIFIED VICTIM 


Dear Ms. Roberts: 

By virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District 
of Florida provides you with the following notice because you are an identified victim of a 
federal offense. 


On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as “Epstein) entered a plea 
of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) 
and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in 
and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cl-009454AXXXMB and 2008-cf- 
009381AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months’ imprisonmen: to be 
followed by an additional six months’ imprisonment, followed by twelve months of 
Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the Court. 

In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to 
defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to cerlain 
conditions, including the following: ‘ 


TD An independent Special Master was assigned the task of selecting an 


attorney representative to represent the victims, including you, in 
connection with civil actions between the victims and Mr. Epstein. The

obligated to use Mr, Josefsberg as your civil attorney, but, as explained 
in greater detail below, Mr. Josefsberg’s services wil} be provided atno 
cost to you because Mr. Epstein is obligated to pay the costs and fees 
of the attorney-representative. Also, Mr. Epstein and his attorneys can 
only contact you via Mr. Tosefsberg, assuming that you would like Mr. 
Josefsberg to serve as your attorfiey. 

If you elect to file suit against Mr. Epstein pursuant to Title 18, United

ofthe United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida 
over his person and/or the subject matter, and Mr. Epstein waives his 
right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages up 
to an amount as agreed to between you and Mr. Epstein, so long as you 
elect to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and you waive any 
other claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common 
law. Notwithstanding this waiver, Epstein’s agreement with the United 


* States, his waivers and failure to contest liability and such damages in 


any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any criminal or civil 
liability. 


As stated above, Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney 
representative selected by the independent third party. ‘This provision, 


however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of 


contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of 
potential settlements, you and Mr. Josefsberg elect to file a contested 
jawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 or you elect to pursue any other 
contested remedy, the obligation to pay the costs of the attorney 
representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay 
reasonable attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in Section 
2255, shall cease. 


Please contact either myself at ann.marie.c.villafana@usdoj.gov, or Justice 


Department Victim-Witness Specialist Twiler Srnith at Twiler. Smith@ic, fi.gov with a good 


telephone number and/or e-mail address, so that we may provide Mr. Josefsberg with a

In addition, there has been litigation between the United States and two other victims 
regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement between the United States andMr. Epstein.

to represent you, that attorney can review the Court’s order in the matter of Jnre Jane Does

interview them and expect the investigation to remain confidential. 


Because of the time delay, there was no need for the victim to be 
taken to a medical facility for a physical for the purpose of 
obtaining evidence. There was also no need to take her to CPT as she

It became evident that some of the recordings were recorded with

the control phone calls from the victim to the suspect Haley Robson. 
I obtained the graphic equalizer and discovered that the calls are

background noise and increasing voice gain. I also learned that a 
tape was broken during the coping of the tape. I returned the copy of 
the tape marked Property Number 05-243 to have it recopied to have an

Juan and Maria Alessi at the State Attorney Office. ASA Weiss had 
requested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the

Donnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight 
years, from the period of 1994 through 2002. She advised she had 
mever had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her 
husband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing 
house cleaning, ‘shopping and other preparations when Epstein would 
arrive in town. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing 
the house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view 
several masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or 
three girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The 
girls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not know any 
of the girls personally and were always different. She was told that 
when Epstein was in residence he did not want to encounter the Alessis 
during his stay in Palm Beach. 


I then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his attorney, Donnie

Epstein shortly after my initial contact with him to find out what was 
going on. Alessi also stated that approximately on November 11, 2005, 
he was contacted by a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy 
Black. The investigator had called him to meet with him to ascertain 
what he was going to tell the police. Alessi stated they met at the 
Carrabba s Restaurant in Boynton Beach and discussed the same

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted 
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way, 
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed 
by Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media 
related material from the residence. 


Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as 
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the 
left side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor 
next to a glass type desk, The CPU had no discernable identifiers or 
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with 
the power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the 
cpu. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor, 
printer, or other media device, On the back Panel of the CPU, I 
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware 
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk. 
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search 
and no external camera was located within this room. 


The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel 
LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative 
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It 
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the 
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same 
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices, 
i.e. CD s, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is 
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media 
was found, 


After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned 
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis 


via a property receipt. 


I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden 
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a 
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and 
printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed 
from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk 
area revealed no signs of any media devices. 


Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana 
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of 
the pool, In the South Hast corner of the room, I observed an office 
type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor, 
keyboard; mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the 
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A 
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.

I also located several media related items within Room B, which were 
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence

desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on. 
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software, 
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active

On December 20, 2005, I contacted ASA Daliah Weiss in an attempt to 
subpoena the Epstein former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. Rodriguez, 
who resides in Miami, had eluded the process servers previously and 
was not served the investigative subpoena. A telephone message was 
left as she is not available during the week of 12/19/2005. I made 
contact with State Attorney Inv Theresa Wyatt and requested the same 
via telephone message. 


I then researched the victim's SG cellular telephone subpoena data 
which had been received from a previous subpoena request. I analyzed 
the records which depict several calls from Haley Robson. The 
telephone calls start on February 6, 2005 at 12:49 pm.; the same day 
which the victim and the victim's father stated the incident occurred 


at Epstein s irst incoming call was from Robson's 
residence at The second incoming call from Robson's

Case No. ...: a (Continued) 
cellular phone occurred at 1:02 pm. The call durations 
were one minute or less. The time frame was within thirteen minutes 


apart. It should be noted that Robson s residence was in close 
proximity to the victim's. The next call occurred at 5:50 pm when the 
victim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after 
the above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson. 
Further analysis showed no telephone calls to either Robson's cellular 
telephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6, 


2005. 


Additionall I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from 
ad The subscriber information confirmed that the number is i 
registered to Paul A Lavery from Hialeah, Florida. The address was 

crossed referenced to the Office of Kiraly and Riley Private 

Investigators. I researched the web page www.rileykiraly.com which 

also showed various cases in which they assisted. I also located 

another web site under www.coralspringssparklandrotary.org in which 

Mr. Riley attended a Miami Rotary meeting and confirmed Atty. Roy

The telephone calls revealed Lave had telephone contact with i ee 

RE just after I attempted to 
interview em, Or Jus ELOY. ackground was conducted on Lavery 
which revealed he holds a current Private Investigator License. A

Buring a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed 
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by 
associates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004 
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included 
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr. 
Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had 
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a 
message to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary 
"Leslie" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal 
assistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez 
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in 
residence. 


I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in 
Palm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked 
specifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he 
would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the 
morning and one massage in thé afternoon everyday he was in residence, 
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them 
comfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them. 


Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them 
entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. 
They would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein. They 
would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if 
any of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask 
their ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate 
like his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they 
would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time. Rodriguez 
stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be 


masseuses, He st, ler Epstein's direction, he delivered 
a dozen roses to High School for oneof the girls 
that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high 


school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the 
massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. 
He would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and 
would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. 
He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put 
them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood 
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed. 


Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a 
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive 
her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl 
always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself 
as a "human ATM machine" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a 
minimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl 
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or 
‘was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl 
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify 
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to

anything the girls would want. 


Rodriguez stated the amount of girls that came to the house was 


approximately fif' girls knew each other and all 
seemed to know at High School who Mr. Epstein was. 
When asked to identify these girls, Rodriguez stated he could not at 


the moment but knew he wrote their names down on a journal he kept 
during his employ with Mr. Epstein. He kept a journal in the event he 
needed to explain either to Mr. Epstein or his assistants what was 
done at the house or who visited the house as he stated he was 
in-charge of Mr. Epstein's personal security while in Palm Beach. I 
informed him I would need to view this journal to which he stated he 
would research the book and contact me to provide the book. The 
interview was concluded and left the area. I returned back to the 
police station where the micro cassette was placed into evidence. At 
approximately 7:20 pm, I was notified Rodriguez located the journal

property when physical surveillance was done. Sjoberg was told of the

to the case. During a sworn taped statement, Sjoberg stated she met 
Epstein three years ago when Ghaline Maxwell approached her while she

three years old when she met Epstein, anything that happened was 
between two consenting adults. I explained to her that she was not in 
any trouble however as part of this investigation, I needed to ask 
certain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein 
would ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her, to 
rub his nipples as he masturbated himself. Sjoberg stated she felt 
"grossed" about the behavior but as she was getting paid, she just 
continued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the 
massages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize the 
vibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages, 
Sjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he 
maintained himself covered under the towel he would be wearing. When 
Epstein would masturbate he would be covered. 


I asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from 
Epstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised 
Epstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College. 
She received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke down. 


Additionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also 
recommended her to another client who resides at Breakers Row in Palm 
Beach. The client she was referred to was "Glenn" unknown last name, 
and his wife, who she provided a massages to. The statement was 
concluded and placed into evidence upon our return to the Palm Beach

Royal Palm Beach. The subpoena was given to her mother, 


I learned through one of the victims MMM that she was personally 
contacted through a_source that has maintained contact with Epstein. 
The source assured MlMshe would receive monetary compensation for her 
assistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. AH also stated 
she was told, "Those who help him wi compensated and those who 
hurt him will be dealt with." I told that tampering with a 
witness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her 
who approached her during this encounter .{MBMMM originally was reluctant 
to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not 
to testify because she felt they were still friends. 


On April 11, 2006, Det Dawson and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida 
and met with the victim, Mil Milicent. i W/F,

she was home during Spring Break in March 2006. a stated she 
did not want to pursue the intimidation charges on Ss

in things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by 

— Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her 

ypoena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April 18, 
2006. 


Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's 
Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the 
subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling 
for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I 
spoke with ASA Weiss and informed her of the possible intimidation by 
the defense. 


On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several 
occasions with ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic to ascertain when the 
victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left 
on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am 
and 11:30 am, I again left messages for ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic 
for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State 
Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury. 


At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and 
located ASA Weiss and ASA Belchlavic in their offices. I entered ASA 
Belohlavic's office who informed me that she was going to return my 
call. She explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty Guy 
Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg 
Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with 
adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to 
psychiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with minors. 
When asked about the all the other victims, Ohlavic stated 
that was the only offer made as to one victim, ASA Belohlavic 
cell phone rang and went to voice mail. She checked her voice mail 
and played the message on speaker. The caller identified himself as

Atty Guy Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them. 
Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jeffrey 
Epstein, and agreed to the deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand 
jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavic stated a probable 
cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county jail and would let 
me know as to when it would be needed. TI explained my disapproval of 
the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered. 
However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval 
would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief 
Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal. I left the area and 
returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the 
deal offered. 


I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a message from 
stepmother for the victim|MMMShe was calling because the State 
Attorney's Office still had not returned any of her calls as to when 
they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavic's office 
and left messages for her to call the victims on this case and 
explained to them what the State Attorney's Office had done. 


On April 17, 2006, at approximately 4:30 pm, State Attorney 
Investigator Tim Valentine called to officially notify me of the 
cancellation of the Grand Jury. He requested I contact the victims 
that had been served to appear, to notify them of the cancellation. I 
advised Valentine that as this Grand Jury session was called based on 
the State Attorney's Office decision to have the victims heard by the 
Grand Jury that I felt it was the States Attorney's Office 
responsibility to contact the victims and advise them of the reason 
they were no longer needed.

As I had not received any contact from anyone at the State Attorney's 
Office, on May 1, 2006, I prepared three arrest warrant requests and 
submitted them to the State Attorney's Office. The packages were 
delivered to the Crimes against Children Unit in care of ASA Lana 
Belohlavek. Jeffrey Epstein's arrest warrant was requested for 4 
counts of Unlawful Sexual activity with certain minors and one count 
of Lewd and Lascivious Molestation. Sarah Kellen, Epstein's 
assistant's, arrest warrant request was for 4 counts of Principal in 
the 1st degree Unlawful Sexual activity with certain minors and one 
count of Principal in the 1st degree Lewd and Lascivious Molestation, 
Haley Robson's arrest warrant request was for Lewd and Lascivious 
Acts on a victim under 16 years of age. The receipt of delivery was 
signed and brought back to the records division at the police

On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate, 
Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm 
Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration, 
was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently 
acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's 
house is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may 
be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence, 
358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting 
remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed 
driving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida 
registration of F30QQF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north 
on County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr. 
Norr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain 
jobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I 
traveled ta-Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue 
stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was 
visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane. 

We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a 
caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed 
several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of 
the executive team for Limited Inc.’ The executives were in Palm Beach 
County for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm 
Beach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on 
the 10th at 5:00 pm. 


On May 12, 2006, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State 
Attorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was 
requesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to 
her I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen, 
and Haley Robson. I asked that she either issue the warrants or 
direct file, as so much time has elapsed since the original request to 
the Grand Jury. I explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had i 
concluded the case in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the 
case to go forward. Belohlavek stated the original offer was again j 
offered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer 
by Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer. j

SSA-1826 ITEMIZED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS 


SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
EARNINGS RECORD INFORMATION 


Date: 10/25/2016 


Our records show the amount of earnings reported, not the amount of 
Social Security taxes that were paid. 


Wages were first covered under Social Security in 1937. Therefore, 

1937 is the first year for which earnings may be shown on our records. 
Employers were required to report earnings semi-annually in 1937, 

and on a quarterly basis for the years from 1938 through 1977. 

Beginning with 1978, employers are required to report earnings annually. 


Our records do not show the exact date of employment (month and day) 
because we do not need this information to figure Social Security 
benefits. Employers do not give us this information. 


Each year, there is a maximum amount of earnings that is subject ta 
Social Security taxes and is used to compute benefits. If a person 
earns more than this maximum amount, the earnings statement will 
usually show the maximum rather than the total earnings. Maximum 
benefits can be found on the SSA website. 
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb. html 


Beginning in 1951, self-employed persons could also receive 

Social Security credit for their work. The maximum amounts of 
self-employment earnings that are subject to Social Security taxes 
and are used to compute benefits can also be found on the SSA website. 
http: //www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb. html 


If you have any questions, you should call, write, or visit any 

Social Security office. If you visit or call, please bring this letter, 
It will help us answer questions. The toll free number to call is 
1-800-772-1213 (for the deaf or hard of hearing, call our TTY number, 
1-800-325-0778) .

Subject: FW: URGENT - this is the statement 


Jane Doe 3 Is Virginia Roberts so not a new individual. 
The allegations made by Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. 


The original allegations are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to 
be untrue 

Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public 
figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschwitz is 
involved in having sexual relations with her, which he denies 


Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised 
as news, as they are defamatory.

_Case No, 08-80736-Civ-Marra/Johnson 
JANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2 
ve 


UNITED STATES 
f 


JANE DOE #3 AND JANE DOE #4’s CORRECTED MOTION PURSUANT TO RULE 21 
FOR JOINDER IN ACTION 


COME NOW Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 (also referred to as “the new victims”), by and 
through undersigned counsel, to file this motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 
to join this action, on the condition that they not re-litigate any issues already litigated by Jane 
Doe #1 and Jane Doc #2 (also referred to as “the current victims”}. The new victims have 
suffered the same violations of their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) as the 
current victims, Accordingly, they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well. 
Because the new victims will not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by the current victims 
(and because they are represented by the same legal counsel as the current victims), the 
Government will not be prejudiced if the Court grants the motion. The Court may “at any time” 
add new parties to the action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Accordingly, the Court should grant the 
motion,! 

FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
' As minor victims of sexual offenses, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 desire to proceed by 


way of pseudonym for the same reasons that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 proceeded in this 
fashion. Counsel for the new victims have made their truc identities known to the Government.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 2 of 14 


As the Court is aware, more than six years ago, Jane Doe #1 filed the present action 
against the Government, alleging a violation of her rights under the CVRA, 18 ULS.C. § 3771. 
DEL. She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had 
entered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her 
rights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court allowed Jane Doe #2 to also join the 
action. Both Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doc #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to 
protect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with 
fairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #1 
and Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein. 

The Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position. In a detailed ruling, the Court 
concluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 even though federal 
charges were never filed. DE £89. The Court explained that because the NPA barred 
‘prosecution of crimes committed against them by Lpstein, they had “standing” to assert 
violations of the CVRA rights. Id. The Court deferred ruling on whether the two victims would 
_be entilled to relief, pending development of a fuller cvidentiary record. Jd. 

Two other victims, who are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims, 
now wish to join this action. The new victims joining at this stage will not cause any delay and 
their joinder in this case is the most expeditious manner in which to pursuc their rights. Because 
the background regarding their abuse is relevant to the Court’s assessment of whether to allow 
them to join, their circumstances are recounted here briefly.

The Government was well aware of Janc Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it 
listed her as a victim in the attachment to the NPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary investigation 
of Jane Doc #3°s relationship to Epstcin would have revealed the fact that she had been 
trafficked throughout the United States and internationally for sexual purposes. Nonetheless, the 
Government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any 
Federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As 
with Jane Doe #1, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement 


from Jane Doc #3 — ail in violation of her rights under the CVRA — to avoid Jane Doe #3 from 


raising powerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein

_and other powerful individuals and that would likely have been prevented it from being 





concluded in the secretive manner in which it was. 
_dane Dog #4’s Circumstances 

Af permitted to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could prove at trial, that 
sh has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doc #1 and Jane Doe #2, based on the 
following: 

As with the other Jane Does, ae Dice #4. was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein, In 
_or around the summer of 2002, Jane Dee #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year- 
old child, was told by another one of Epstein’s underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could 
make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach, An acquaintance of Jane Doe 
#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4 
to go to Epstein’s house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the 
phone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to 
his mansion in Palm Beach. 

Jane Doe #4 then went to Epstein’s mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein’s large 
bathroom by one of Epstein’s assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and lay face 
_down on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her 
_age and she told him she had recently tured sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed illegal 
sexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions. 

Epstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e. a cell phone) to arrange for these 
sexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.c., on his personal 


Jed) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doe #4.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 8 of 14 


‘The acis Epstcin committed against Jane Doe #4, constituted numerous federal sex 
offenses, some of which do not carry a statute of limitations and thus are not time-barred. See 18 
U.S.C, § 3283. And these offenses were the kinds of offenses that the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southem District of Florida were pursuing 
_in 2007. So far as Jane Doe #4 is aware, the U.S. Attorney’s Office made ao serious effort to 
locate her. Instead, after identifying approximately forty separate underage sexually abused 
_victims, and apparently ptoparing # 53-page federal indictment and with full awarencss of the 
existence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 — unidentified and not interviewed — it entered into a 
non-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein’s federal crimes against these victims. 
This is contrary to the Government’s normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It 
also violated Jane Doe #4’s rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a 
“reasonable” right to confer with the U.S. Attorney’s Office before they entered into an 
agreement with a scx offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he committed against 
her. 18 U.S.C. § 3773 {aj(5). 

_MOTION FOR JOINDER 

Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 now both move to join this action filed by Jane Doe #1 and 

Jane Doe #2, pursuant to Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 21 provides that 


...a party.” Rule 2] 


“fojn motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add 
“grants the court broad discretion to permit a change in the parties at any stage of a litigation.”

‘The new victims will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in 
the same way as it violated the rights of the other victims. The new victims* participation in this 
case is important because it appears that the Government intends to raise a factual defense that 
somehow it did keep Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 properly informed of what was happening in 
the criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not 
_properly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for 
a CVRA violation, 

In addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation is relevant to a defense the 
Court has allowed the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims’ 
request for rescission of the NPA “implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be 
considered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant 
prosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims — including an assessment of the 
allegation of a deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims 
‘in the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well 
aficr the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli.” DE 
189 at 12 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation in this case will 
help to show what the “entire interface” was between the Government and the victims and thus 
_to respond to the Government’s estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be 
preparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the Govemment to the victim’s 
summary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments against the 


victim’s position).

Jane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation is also directly relevant to the discovery 
disputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections 
to the documents that Jane Doc #1 and Jane Doe #2 are attempting to obtain. The current 
victims have responded by explaining how these documents are rclevant, including explaining 
how these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his powerful political and 
social connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s 
motive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an elfort to 
maintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knowledge. See, e.g., 
DE 266 at 6-10. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of 
these requests, as well as the need for those requests. 

One clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding 
Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea 
arrangement and/or non-prosccution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince 
Andrew and former Harvard jaw Professor Alan Dershowitz. Jane Doe #1! and Janc Doe #2 
have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, afier Epstein signed the 
non-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and 
political connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See, 
€.8., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at 16-18). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knowledge of 
_Epstein’s connection with some of these powerful people and thus how Epstein might have used 
them to secure favorable treatment. 


Adding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings. They will 





simply join ia motions that the current victims were going to file in any event. For example, the

new victims will simply join in a single summary judgment motion that the current victims 
anticipate filing after discovery has been completed. 

Nor will adding the new victims prejudice the United States. As the court is aware, this 
Court is still in its initial discovery stage. The Court is currently considering whether to reject 
the Government’s assertion of privilege over documents regarding the case. See DE 265 
(victims’ reassertion of objections to the Government privilege claims). The new victims do not 
seek any additional discovery beyond that previously sought by the current victims.” 
Accordingly, the United States will not be prejudiced or burdened by adding them to this case. 

The CVRA does not contain any statute of limitations for filing an action to enforce 
rights under the statute. Accordingly, were the Court to deny this motion, the result might be 
that the new victims would then be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims, which would 
then possibly proceed on a separate litigation track. Rather than require duplicative litigation, 
the Court should simply grant their motion to join, 

Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 support the joinder motion. Counsel for the victims have 
discussed this motion with the Government at fength in an effort to avoid any need to file a 
substantive pleading on the issue, Counsel for the victims asked the Government during the 
summer for its position on joinder. The Government, however, took the matter under 
advisement for months. Ultimately, after several inquiries from victims counsel, the 
Government indicated without explanation that it opposes this motion. Coursel for the victims 
has requested a meeting with the Government on this issue, which will hopefully occur in 

? Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have asked the Government to provide them with the 


record of their statements that they provided to the FBI. These FBI 302’s should be only a few 


pages long.

January. In the meantime, however, counsel for the victims believe that it is no longer 
appropriate to delay filing this motion and accordingly file it at this time. Because the 
Government is apparently opposing this motion, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have described 
the circumstances surrounding their claims so that the Court has appropriate information to rule 


on the motion.

CONCLUSION 
Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 should be allowed to join this action, pursuant to Rule 21 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Their joinder should be conditioned on the requirement 
that they not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. A 
proposed order to that effect is attached to this pleading,
