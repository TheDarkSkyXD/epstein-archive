Recessions and Corporate Fraud often go hand-in-hand, as discussed in this report.
by
F. John Stark, III
Managing Principal
Water Tower Capital, LLC
John Stark is the Managing Principal of Water Tower Capital, LLC. John's path to
 becoming an experienced investor and manager of stressed and distressed companies
began more than two decades ago when he joined the Minneapolis law firm, Briggs 
and Morgan. His work on a project finance transaction led him to joining the client
as the Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, and within six months the client
completed an IPO. John's career on the buy side began when he joined the private
 placement group at Washington Square Capital, in Minneapolis. In 1990, he joined
PPM America in Chicago, where he became the head of the Special Investments Group
($1 Billion workout portfolio; $1 Billion asset-based loan portfolio; and $900 million
in capital in 3 Distressed Debt funds). John first retained the principals of Investigative
Management Group in 1992.
John's experience on the sell side includes being a partner at Corporate Financial
Advisors, LLC and Managing Director and co-head of the Restructuring Group at Oppenheimer
& Co., Inc. in Los Angeles, California. John has also testified as both a 30 (b)
 (6) witness and as an expert witness in various state, federal, tax, and bankruptcy
court proceedings. John co-authored "Marriott Risk: A New Model Covenant to Restrict
Transfers of Wealth from Bondholders to Stockholders", Columbia Business Law Review
503 (1994).

A message from Investigative Management Group:
As the pandemic pushes into a global recession, we again see an increase in fraud
around the world. Utilizing our investigative experience, with extensive cyber capabilities,
we find ourselves on the front lines of global fraud investigations. When boards
 of directors, owners of businesses, and/or interested parties need to get to the
bottom of any internal investigation, our services are required. When a law firm
 is hired to conduct an investigation, they can provide an excellent internal review.
IMG provides extensive internal and external verification of statements from witnesses,
utilizing cyber experts, social media experts, surveillance, field interviews, asset
investigations, and confidential source inquiries. Our firm provides law firms with
information, facts and evidence from the field. This gives a complete view of both
internal and external factors, very much like the FBI, DEA, and other federal agencies
working with the U.S. Attorney.
All business performed by IMG  is done in compliance with industry regulations, 
including the recent GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) data security law
 implemented by the European Union on May 25th, 2018.

Investigative Management Group's Services:
LITIGATION SUPPORT - IMG provides a range of investigative and intelligence-gathering
services on behalf of attorneys and their clients. IMG assists legal counsel in 
the discovery process by identifying and interviewing witnesses, locating assets,
assessing net worth, and conducting background investigations and surveillance when
appropriate. When investigating internal fraud, workplace violence, sexual harassment
and discrimination cases, IMG works with companies to uncover early warning signs,
creates an action and response plan, and helps deploy professional staff to assist
and counsel employees in the aftermath of an incident. To help build cases, IMG 
utilizes the latest investigative cyber forensics to uncover infiltration or tampering
with computer systems and electronic assets, and helps recover lost data and communications.
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS / DUE DILIGENCE - IMG provides a comprehensive analysis
of a potential business partner, entity, investor, employee or individual, both 
domestically and abroad. IMG conducts inquiries that include federal criminal records,
civil litigation, employment history, UCC filings and warrants, real and personal
property holdings, all corporate and business affiliations, regulatory searches 
in relevant industries, United States Tax Court records, and a full media search,
including relevant trade and business media.
CYBER SECURITY/DIGITAL FORENSICS  -   Cybercrime is at an all-time high and has 
become an ever-increasing threat. IMG's Digital Forensic/Cyber Security division
 can conduct a comprehensive assessment of your I.T. systems. This assessment includes
an evaluation of the current security system's policies and procedures and recommendations
to enhance overall efficiency and cost effectiveness.  Eavesdropping devices, covert
cameras, and other surveillance tools may be in use against your company, yet go
 undetected by traditional security or cyber security measures.  IMG offers professional
TSCM inspections (Technical Surveillance Countermeasures) for corporate offices,
 boardrooms, meetings, and any location requiring information-security and privacy.
SECURITY/EXECUTIVE PROTECTION - IMG provides secure transportation and security 
for your employees or family during international or domestic travel. IMG personnel
conduct reconnaissance in the areas of the particular visit, which could include
 preparing primary and alternate driving routes, identifying safe locations, medical
facilities and centers of law enforcement and liaising with other representatives,
security organizations or government agencies as required. IMG performs a comprehensive
analysis of a company's vulnerability to a range of threats, including terrorist
 attacks, natural disasters, workplace violence, theft and spying.
