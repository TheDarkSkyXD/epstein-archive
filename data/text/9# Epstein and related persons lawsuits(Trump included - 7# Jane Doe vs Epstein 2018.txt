Speakerphone Conference 


(In chambers; speakerphone call initiated) 





THE COURT: Good afternoon. This is Judge Netburn. I 
have you here with my law clerk and with a court reporter. 


What I'm going to ask is that each party state its 





appearance for the record, and then if I can request that 





whenever anybody speaks, that that person identify themself 
again so that the court reporter can properly attribute your 


comments to the correct person. And then last housekeeping 





matter is that when I do these telephone conference, I do them 
as a courtesy to the parties. Obviously, you can't read body 
language over the phone, so please be considerate of one 
another and do your very best not to speak over somebody who is 


speaking. 











So, who is here on behalf of the plaintiff? 





MS. McCAWLEY: Good afternoon, your Honor. This is 





oy 


Sigrid McCawley, from the law firm of Boies, Schiller & 








Flexner, and I represent the plaintiff Sarah Ransome, and I 
have on the line with me as well Paul Cassell, who is our 
co-counsel who also represents plaintiff, Ms. Ransome. 

THE COURT: Thank you. 


MR. CASSELL: Good afternoon, your Honor. 





THE COURT: Good afternoon. 





And on behalf of Mr. Epstein and others? 





MR. LINK: Good afternoon, your Honor. This is Scott 











Link on behalf of defendants Epstein, Kellen and Groff, and we

really appreciate your time this afternoon. Thank you. 


MS. MENNINGER: Good afternoon, your Honor. Laura 





Menninger on behalf of defendant Ghislain Maxwell. 

















THE COURT: Thank you. 





All right. So I have a series of letters from the 





parties regarding the dispute over the confidentiality order. 
My understanding is that the parties agree in principle to a 
confidentiality order but we have some disputes over its scope. 
Having reviewed the two versions that were filed 
yesterday, I believe the primary disputes are on paragraph 3, 
where the definition of what is confidential is being 
negotiated, and then with respect to paragraph 8, about who is 


the qualified designating party. And then in the plaintiff's 





proposal there is a paragraph 13, regarding what to do with 
respect to electronic information that is sought by subpoena 


from a nonparty. 





Are those the three areas in dispute at this point? 

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is Laura Menninger 
for Ms. Maxwell. 

There also is a dispute in paragraph 12 that relates 
to the paragraph 13, that is whether electronic copies could 
be -- after the conclusion of the case. 

THE COURT: Sorry. You cut out for a minute. Whether 
electronic copies? 


MS. MENNINGER: Could be maintained after the

Speakerphone Conference 


conclusion of the case. 





THE COURT: OK. I see what you are referring to. 


All right. So let's begin with paragraph 3, which is 








the definition of "confidential." And as I understand it, 





defendant Maxwell seeks a definition that would encompass 





information that is, quote, confidential, and implicates common 
law and statutory privacy interests. Whereas the designation 


from the plaintiff is, in my opinion, more broad, which just 














requires a good faith basis to believe that the material is 
entitled to confidential treatment. 


So the plaintiff here seems to be advocating for a 





— 


more broad definition of confidentiality. I think the problem 
with that is should there be a dispute that I need to resolve 
as to whether something is appropriate or not, I think the way 
it is written in paragraph 3 would require me to evaluate 
whether or not the designating party had a good faith basis and 
potentially even their own subjective view. And to the extent 
there is an objective test that is implicit here, I'm not quite 
sure what I would be weighing that against. So I'm not -- I'm 
a little concerned that paragraph 3 is so broad. 

That said, I think -- you know, I guess I'm curious to 
hear what the nature of the conversations have been on this 
particular topic to get a sense of where the real concerns lie. 

MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley for 


the plaintiff. If I could just address that briefly?

Ib7ddoec 





Speakerphone Conference 


The one -- with respect to paragraph 3, the one thing 








that is also different between the version that we proposed and 
the version that Ms. Maxwell proposed which relates to 
paragraph 3 is in the beginning, the opening paragraph of 

Ms. Maxwell's protective order, you will see additional 


language that is not in our protective order, and that is the 





sentence that says, "Upon" —- at the very beginning of the 





protective order, "Upon a showing of good cause in support of 


the entry of a protective order to protect the discovery and 











dissemination of confidential information or information which 
will improperly annoy, embarrass, or oppress any party, 
witness, or person providing discovery in this case, it is so 
ordered." That language is not included in our introductory 
paragraph. 


We have in our proposal order, "Upon a showing of good 








cause in support of the entry of a protective order to protect 











the discovery and dissemination of confidential information in 





this case, it is so ordered," because in our view that language 
allows the defendants to mark in a broad manner information as 


confidential that may not have -- they may not have a good 











faith basis for asserting confidentiality. 





THE COURT: Can we pull back the lens for a minute? 








What are the types of documents that we are talking 
about here that the parties have concern over? 
MS. McCAWLEY: This is Sigrid McCawley again for the

plaintiff. 
Your Honor, we started this conversation by in this 


case not proposing a protective order; it is the defendants who 





wanted the protective order. We agreed to it in good faith in 


order to try to move discovery along in this case. 





My understanding is the types of -- you know, I see 











this as a sexual trafficking case, and the types of information 











that will be exchanged may have information of a sexual nature. 


However, unlike prior cases that we have had that have dealt 

















with minors, the plaintiff in this case was not a minor at the 








time she was trafficked. So we were we believe that we did 
not need a protective order in this case as an initial matter. 
The defendants would like a protective order in this matter. 


THE COURT: So maybe, Ms. Menninger, you can tell me 





what it is that you believe you are -- what is motivating you 
here? What are you worried about producing that you want to 
keep confidential? 

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I believe that the 
majority of the concerns will be related to discussions during 
depositions about sexual activities. Plaintiff has alleged not 
only that my client ran a sex trafficking organization but she 
claims also that she was directed by my client and the Epstein 
defendants to have sex with third parties, including Alan 


Dershowitz, for example. And so to the extent my client or 





Mr. Dershowitz or anyone else is going to be asked about their

Speakerphone Conference 


private sexual activity, I believe that would implicate their 





privacy rights for the reasons that Judge Sweet articulated in 














the opinion that I had referenced in my moving letter. He 
analyzed it largely on the basis of sexual activity -- or 
sexual conduct being encompassed within a right of privacy -- a 





broad right of privacy and that people who will be in pretrial 





litigation have a right of some type around their private 


affairs, to include sexual activity. 














I will say that plaintiffs have requested things like 





tax returns. They've requested credit card statements. 


They've requested photographs. They requested all kinds of 





materials relating to my client's personal life. The requests 
range from the years 1997 through today. 

So to sort of -- I think in my view there is a 
mechanism within the protective order that should the other 
parties disagree with the designation of confidentiality, to 
raise that concern, and then if the parties still can't agree, 
to bring it to the Court's attention. I think, in my view, 
that's the more cost-effective and efficient way to go about 
this rather than a third party who get involved or a witness 
who is called to testify, having to raise it individually 
themselves in a motion to quash or a motion for a protective 
order. 

I think it is not just documents that we're talking 


about but based on my experience in the Giuffre v. Maxwell

matter, it largely came up during the course of deposition 





testimony. There were also medical records that were being 
sought, psychiatric records being sought and I anticipate that 


would occur in this case as well. 





THE COURT: Make sure that everybody is speaking as 
slowly and as clearly as possible so that the court reporter 
can be sure to get everybody's statement. 

I guess my concern here is —— I think that this goes 
for both paragraphs, both paragraph 3's, that when the dispute 
comes up, I need to have a standard against which I can measure 
an application. And so, in my opinion, it is more effective if 
we can have some more detail. And so if the parties are 
prepared to agree to deem confidential, for instance, you know, 
information that relates to, you know, sexual conduct or sexual 
activity, you know, information that discloses personal 
identifying information, which would cover tax returns, 
information that discloses medical records, you know, and then, 
if necessary, there can be some sort of a catchall, but at 
least then I think that will save disputes in the first 
instance, and if there are disputes, it will give me some sense 
of what is intended here. 

(Pause) 

MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley for 
the plaintiff.

activity is that the case we brought is obviously for violation 














under the Sexual Trafficking Act, so it would encompass 





essentially everything that's going to transpire in the case. 





And while that -- there may be a way to modify that, for 


example, sexual activity as it relates to minors or something 





in that regard if we are going to have a witness who was abused 





by, or allegedly abused by the defendants when they were 





underage, I will be willing to talk about something like that 





would cover or protect from that issue. But to have a very 





broad definition of any sexual activity would -—- you know, 
everything we would be filing would be almost entirely under 
seal, in my view. 


THE COURT: Well, you know, your point is well taken 





that this is the topic of this case, and as a result, I think 
very little would be authorized to be filed under seal should 
it be relevant to an issue that the Court is going to decide. 
And so my —- you know, right now we're really talking about 
discovery and exchanging information, and I think it's 
reasonable for nonparties especially, but even parties, to, you 
know, to disclose information without a fear that it's going to 
be passed along to the New York Times. And so, you know, it 
may ultimately be covered by the press because it may 


ultimately be tried, or there may be motion practice where all 








of this is disclosed. But for the purposes of discovery, I'm 


less sympathetic to the argument that this case is about sexual

trafficking and therefore everything needs to be available to 
the public. 


Is there a way that you think you can narrow the issue 





to accommodate your concerns? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is Laura Menninger on 
behalf of Ms. Maxwell. 


I am happy to draft a list of potential topics that I 








think are encompassed by the subject matter and circulate it. 





I don't have -- I agree with all of the ones your Honor 


suggested, and I would like to just take a look back at the 





discovery requests thus far and see if there are any additional 


ree 


discrete areas along with the language for a catchall that we 


hee. 


could use as our measuring stick going forward. 





THE COURT: What is your response to Ms. McCawley's 





general concern, and, therefore, what if we limited the sexual 
nature documents to those that concern nonparties? 

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I can only speak from the 
experience of the last case in which my client was asked by 
these same counsel about her consensual sexual adult 
relationships with others, including Mr. Epstein. So I don't 
think addressing -- we are only talking about minors or 


nonconsensual activities, those are the only things that are 





likely to come up. If they are not planning to ask questions 


about adult consensual relationships, then I probably would 








have less of a concern. But we actually had a couple rounds of

litigation before Judge Sweet in that case over whether my 
client had to answer questions regarding her adult consensual 
sexual activities, and ultimately, relying on the protective 
order, he ordered her to answer those questions. 


So I'm -- I don't think that the distinction about 











whether it is a case involving alleged trafficking of minors or 





adults changes what I anticipate may be asked. I could be 
completely wrong and they don't plan to ask those same kind of 
questions in this case. 

THE COURT: OK. Why don't I ask you, Ms. Menninger, 
to send a revised paragraph 3. I think the goal here is to be 
as specific as possible. And, again, because of the nature of 
this litigation, I think it's likely that much of the 
information that you seek to hold confidential for purposes of 
discovery would ultimately be disclosed certainly at a trial. 
Obviously, this protective order makes clear of that. 

MS. MENNINGER: Right. 


TH 


Fl 


COURT: But even in the context of any motion 





practice, it may well be that the Court needs to rely on this 
information in order to render a decision, which would then 


sg 


make that confidential information a judicial document for 





which the public has a presumptive right of access. OK. 
MS. MENNINGER: All right. Yes, your Honor. I am 
happy to do that. 
This is Laura Menninger.

Speakerphone Conference 


THE COURT: OK. So let's see what that is. I don't 





think that the proviso that the defendants have in their -- 
Sorry. 


(Pause) 





—- in the opening paragraph of the protective order 
that talks about annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, I 


think that that should be removed, and so I would adopt the 








plaintiff's version of the sort of preliminary whereas clause 





for the protective order. But let's see if we can be more 
specific in paragraph 3 as to what it is that we are seeking to 
protect. 

OK. Paragraph 8. 

Paragraph 8, as I understand it, has to do with who 
has the right to designate something as confidential. And in 
my experience it has always been the producing party who has 
the obligation and the right to do so, but maybe in this case 


there are other concerns that I am not focusing on. Who wants 





to address this in the first instance? 


MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley. I 





am the one who proposed the language for paragraph 8. 





The concern we had was from other actions -- 





Ms. Menninger has referenced the action before Judge Sweet, 





where one party would designate wholescale a nonparty, for 





example, all of their testimony confidential irrespective of 


whether the nonparty believes that it should be held

confidential. And so this paragraph, I adjusted it to 
provide -- 


THE COURT: Sorry. Ms. McCawley, you've got to speak 





half as fast. 
MS. McCAWLEY: I'm so sorry. 
THE COURT: We will never get a record here. 
MS. McCAWLEY: I'm sorry. 
So with this paragraph, I proposed to change the 


language such that only the person that is actually producing 





the confidential information, the one who owns that 


confidential information, would be able to designate it as 





confidential to protect from having a party wholescale 
designate things as confidential that weren't that individual's 
confidential information. 

THE COURT: And your example is a nonparty gets 
deposed and then the defendant says everything in that 
nonparty's deposition should be confidential? 

MS. McCAWLEY: Exactly. 

THE COURT: Well, in part I would imagine that that 
would be -- we would have some limitations based on the revised 
paragraph 3 that will be more specific about what can and 
cannot be designated as confidential. And so, you know, I 
don't think testimony that, you know, one party believes is 
intended to annoy or to harass is an appropriate designation. 
But if that nonparty were speaking about something more narrow

Speakerphone Conference 





and more particularized, how would you feel about that 
designation? 

MS. McCAWLEY: Well, it can certainly be, for example, 
if that individual provided testimony with respect to something 


in this matter that they did not want to mark as confidential 











or, for example, produce photographs of the defendants with 





them that they did not want marked as confidential, under the 





old version of this protective order, the defendants could come 





in and mark it as confidential and the nonparty would have no 





control over that situation. 

So this is meant to -- in other words, the party who 
is providing the information, whether it be by subpoena or 
whether it be a party to this agreement, has the ability to 
mark their information confidential if they want it to be 
protected in that manner, but no other person can do that other 
than the person who is producing the information. 

THE COURT: OK. Ms. Menninger, that's certainly the 
most traditional way to proceed. What's the reason for not 
doing it that way? 

(Pause) 

MR. LINK: Your Honor, this Scott Link. Can I be

MR. LINK: So, first, I think it's unfair to expect a 





third-party witness, some of whom are not represented by 





lawyers, to have to make the decision about confidentiality. 
Second, when a third-party witness comes in and gives 


testimony that relates to potential, for example, sexual 











activity with one of the defendants, then that defendant should 








have the right to designate that information as confidential. 








It's one thing to say that the defendant -- you know, that 
whoever the third-party witness is doesn't have an interest in 


maintain confidentiality, but that's really only half of the 





equation, because the person that they're testifying about may 








in fact want to keep that particular sexual relationship or 





consensual relationship from being in The New York Times, like 


you said. 





So I think it just creates more of an issue for us if 


we leave it to an unrepresented person to control whether the 





confidentiality applies, particularly where you're going to 


give us a definition now in paragraph 3 that should be more 





limiting in what can be designated. And, frankly, if a party 


goes too far in the designation, then we'll be back before you,

Thank you, your Honor. 

THE COURT: Thank you. 

MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley 
again. 

Just to address Mr. Link's comments in a reply from 
the plaintiff, exactly what he is saying is what we're trying 
to prevent, having to come back to you multiple times over 
something like this. So the party who is, for example, a 
nonparty witness who brings to a deposition photographs showing 
that witness with the defendant, those are that nonparty's 
photographs and they should be able to mark them as 
confidential and (unintelligible). So choose or not mark them 
as confidential, it is their material to designate. It 
shouldn't be that a party to the litigation can then coax that 
in confidentiality through this order. In other words, it 
creates more layers of dispute relating to confidentiality than 
is necessary. 

THE COURT: I guess one question I have is, you know, 
what confidence do you have that a lay witness who comes to 


testify will have any understanding of the concept of 





confidentiality and any rights that he or she might be able to 


invoke to keep from the press his or her sexual activity? That

is question number one. 
And question number two is, you know, with respect to 
the comment made by Mr. Link, which is that, you know, someone 


else may be implicated in a way that they wish not to be 





disclosed. You know, obviously, the nonparty is free to talk 


about their own experiences in whatever way they wish outside 








of the context of the litigation, but in the context of this 


litigation, if they are called upon to disclose information 





that might be I'll say confidential to a party, why shouldn't 
that party be able to protect his or her interests? 

MS. McCAWLEY: This is Sigrid McCawley again. 

So to address the first point, in this litigation thus 
far, we've only had obviously a few handful of depositions, and 
all of the nonparty deponents are represented by counsel. So 


this is not -- it is a hypothetical that we are posing, of 





course, but it is not a circumstance that has arisen in this 
case with respect to any nonparty witnesses. 

On this second point of -- you made the point that 
they are free to disclose. Obviously, a nonparty is in control 
of their information if they want to disclose it, and that is 
why courts typically have the standard that everything is open 
and public. So we're going against that standard by folding in 


a Situation where a party could designate some other 





individual's information as being confidential. So, it cuts 











against what the standard is for federal court disclosures

generally, and that individual has the right to disclose that 
if they so choose. 

THE COURT: OK. All right. I think I'm going to take 
paragraph 8 under advisement and think a little bit, and I will 
issue an order later on as to how to proceed on that topic. 

Let's —- 


MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is Laura Menninger 


again. If I may just quickly, I want to correct one 
misstatement. 
There were a number of -- there are a number of 





witnesses in this case who have been implicated by plaintiff 
and do not have counsel. I think there are something like 80 
witnesses who have been endorsed. And certainly if plaintiff 


counsel believes that they -- each of those people have 





counsel, they have not shared that information with us. So I 


do actually believe this is quite a big concern that there will 





be people involved in the pretrial discovery process who do not 
have lawyers make the kind of assessment that paragraph 8 
suggests they have a lawyer who would make it for them. 

THE COURT: OK. OK. I appreciate that. 

OK. Let's move to paragraph 12 and 13, which I think 
are connected. 


Paragraph 12, as I understand it, the issue in dispute 





is with respect to the retention of electronic copies and a 


representation that they would be not distributed at the

conclusion of the litigation. And I take it that the 
defendants' concern is that that paragraph and paragraph -—- 
that provision in paragraph 12 implies that electronic 


documents would be retained, and I presume that what you want 





is full destruction of those documents. 

You know, in this day and age -- 

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, Laura Menninger. 

THE COURT: Yes. 

MS. MENNINGER: That is correct. In the last case we 
had that provision so that there would be destruction. 
Obviously, if the case goes to trial, anything that is aired 


publicly at the trial would not be destroyed. If there are 





motions practice where documents are legal documents and relied 
upon by the Court, they enjoy the protections of the matter. 
But I do -- it is our request that there not be material held 
indefinitely afterwards if they don't qualify under one of 


those exceptions (unintelligible) because the pretrial 





discovery process should not be used for ulterior purposes like 
gathering material in subsequent media, you know, 
participation, that shouldn't be the reason why these materials 
are (unintelligible) for purposes of use at trial or as 
judicial documents so that the matters can be resolved, as they 
should be, through the court system. 

MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley for 
the plaintiff.

And I proposed the language in 12, but Ms. Menninger, 
in response to that language, proposed paragraph 13. So that 
was what we were negotiating. I want to make clear, 13 is not 
my language. It was an accommodation with when I proposed 12. 


And the reason why I proposed 12 is really more of a 


technical reason. It is in my view -- and I have limited IT 
experience, but in my view, the order that was -- is the prior 
order that we had talked about makes it -- makes you attest to 





the fact that you have destroyed all electronic information 





that has been marked as confidential. And as you know, in this 





electronic age, what happens is if you are filing, for example, 





pleadings under seal, those documents get attached as filings. 


Then they get moved by email to different individuals, 





circulated in drafts. They get sent to experts. They get 


moved electronically in a number of ways that in my view is 





virtually impossible as an attorney to attest that you have 


destroyed every single electronic -- you've extracted it from 





other filings, other pdfs, and destroyed every single piece of 





that confidential information, particularly when there are 











large-scale confidentiality designations in a case where things 


are —-— the majority or the bulk of the information in the case 





is designated confidential such that anytime discovery is used 


in any manner, you would have to track down every single email 





or electronic version of that document and make sure you have 


destroyed it.

So this is really from my perspective as a 
practitioner, practically being able to say I have destroyed -- 
certifying I have destroyed everything I think is really an 
impossibility in that regard. So that is why I proposed the 
language, to attest that you've not destroyed it, you won't 
destroy it, you will hold on to it, and not do so without a 
court order, but I think it's virtually impossible to attest 
that you have been able to destroy it all. 

THE COURT: Well, I think that's a reasonable concern 
given the technology. And I guess as to paragraph 13, my 
reaction was -- and I think maybe this is what gave the 
defendants some pause —-- I mean, why can't paragraph 13 simply 
say that absent a court order, you know, that the party is not 
going to respond to a subpoena? You know, obviously notify the 
designating party that a subpoena has been served, but the 
protective order just prohibits you from responding. And you 
can tell the party that subpoenas you, sorry, I'm bound by a 
court order. You know, I can make an application to the Court 
for permission to respond, but absent a court order, I can't 
produce these documents. And in that way there will be no -—- I 


think that will be a good protection for the defendants against 





some production of documents, whether electronic or otherwise, 
that may be still accessible to the plaintiffs after the 
litigation is over. 

MS. McCAWLEY: Yes, your Honor. This is Sigrid

McCawley again. 


I'm sorry, Laura. 











I'm comfortable with that modification or any 
modification of paragraph 13 in that regard. 

MS. MENNINGER: This is Laura Menninger on behalf of 
Ms. Maxwell. 

My only small concern to the paragraph 13 suggestion 
is just to make sure we all are clear about what a court order 
means, because in some contexts, in some cases, subpoenas are 
viewed as court orders, and so I did not want a subpoena to be 
construed as having the same force and effect as an actual, you 
know, review and consideration by a judicial officer and then 
giving rise to a court order. So with the caveat that a court 
order really means that and it is not a subpoena, I don't have 
a problem with that aspect of paragraph 13. 

Getting back to the issues that Ms. McCawley raised 
regarding, you know, the difficulty of complying with 
destroying electronic copies, I think as long as there were a 
certification that an attempt has been made to destroy 
electronic copies, recognizing that perhaps not every single 
one was caught, would then alleviate the defendants' concerns. 
My concern, I think as the Court understands, is that 
intentionally holding on to electronic copies and then 


participating in trying to get a court order to release those 





copies kind of undercuts the utility of the protective order in

a way that makes -- would potentially make witnesses and 





parties feel reluctant to provide information which they 





thought was going to live on forever ina lawyer's file 
regardless of whether it ultimately became public in a 


courtroom. And so, you know, I think there could be language 








maybe better crafted which said you make a good faith effort to 





destroy the electronic copy, you know, that that would 


alleviate the practicality concerns raised by Ms. McCawley but 








also give some comfort to parties or third-party witnesses who 





are understandably reluctant to have the limited categories of 
documents exist forever and also ensure that the litigation 
process is not being for ulterior purposes with regards to the 
media. 

THE COURT: Well, I am -- I think we're on our way to 
finding a solution. Obviously, a good faith effort, the beauty 
is in the eye of the beholder. And Ms. McCawley raises the, 
you know, probable experience of lawyers during the course of 
the litigation e-mailing documents back and forth. Look at 
this. What do you think about this? Etc. Etc. And to comply 
with any good-faith obligation would -- you know, the lawyers 
need to then, you know, cull through their emails almost like 
an e-discovery search to find out -- to find documents. That 
seems a little bit much. 

You know, maybe the -- you know, as long as they 
represent that they've destroyed their --

MR. LINK: This is Scott Link. Maybe it is my phone 





that is cutting out, but I'm only hearing a few words here and 
there for the last 20/30 seconds. 

MS. MENNINGER: That is my problem, too. This is 
Laura Menninger. 

I apologize, your Honor. 

THE COURT: Well, we can try another phone call or we 
can have people come in.

MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley.

microphone is at all so that Ms. Menninger and Mr. Link can 
hear better. 

THE COURT: I'm happy to try. I haven't moved and I'm 
pretty close. 


In any event, my concern is about what obligations 





would be on counsel of all sides, all parties, to sort of go 





through their email and other electronic file retention to 





destroy documents. And it seems perfectly reasonable to 








require a party to, for example, destroy an electronic file, so 


maybe the file set, but it seems less reasonable to require 





lawyers at the conclusion of this litigation to search through 





the thousands of internal emails and identify and delete those

emails that have a document attached to them. That seems 
burdensome and unnecessary. 


You know, in my experience, and I take it that you all 





have had litigation experience between each other, but I find 





that lawyers often overlitigate protective orders for fear of 
nefarious conduct that very rarely comes to pass. And maybe 
you all have experience to know that that conduct may arise, 
but the parties are going to sign this protective order and 


they're going to agree to be bound by it and to keep in 





confidence the information that they receive, and they will be 








held in contempt if they fail to comply. And, you know, I'm 
not sure that any wordsmithing that we're going to do here with 
respect to the destruction of electronic documents is going to 
be that much more powerful than the fact that I will hold the 
party in contempt if they violate any of the terms of this 
protective order. 

So I think, you know, requiring a party to destroy 
their electronic file maybe is reasonable, but I don't think it 
is reasonable to require them to comb through three years worth 
of emails to see whether or not there are any attachments that 
might be of confidential material, and that the party will 
agree that they won't produce any documents in response to a 


subpoena after -—- you know, absent a court order from a 





competent jurisdiction. 


It seems to me that should be that should be --

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is -- 

THE COURT: Go ahead. 

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is Laura Menninger, 
for Ms. Maxwell. 


I appreciate your comments and I understand where they 





are coming from. The other reason I had referenced Judge 











Sweet's opinion in the Giuffre matter is that in that opinion 














he talks about plaintiff's counsel supporting the protective 








order throughout the litigation of that matter and then 
afterwards, when the Miami Herald had an application to have 
access to the confidential information, that they reversed 
position and supported the Miami Herald's application so that 
the Miami Herald, who I now have been observing by their 
reporter as of yesterday, is writing a story about this -- 
about Ms. Giuffre's case and has introduced Ms. Giuffre. And 
her counsel have supported their application to have access to 
the confidential information after the conclusion of the case 
and after the (unintelligible). 


So Judge Sweet ruled that he declined the 





invitation to do so in that opinion. I think that is -- while 





I do think that in most cases parties are concerned about 


things that never come to pass, in this particular case, I had 





to -—- we have reason to be concerned that even though the 


protective order says what it says, should the case resolve 


afterwards, there may be a changed position by plaintiff's

counsel. 

MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley for 
the plaintiff. 

That isn't accurate and it needs to stand corrected. 


If you look at the filings that we submitted, the Miami Herald 








was trying to get access to information under the protective 


order as well as other third parties. There are two appeals 








pending. We did not file any of those appeals. They are by 





other third parties who had access to the information. We said 





that if they are going to be accessing information, it has to 
be to all of the information, it cannot be to a selective 
portion of the confidential information. And that was the 
position that we took in that litigation. And Judge Sweet did 
not make any comment that Laura had just stated that he did. 
Those orders stand for themselves, as we read, by the Court. 


THE COURT: OK. Well, again, I'm not quite sure we 





can account for all of the potential scenarios that the parties 


are contemplating or anticipating. I think we can revise 





paragraphs 12 and 13 to require the destruction of electronic 


files and that, you know, the commitment to keep in confidence 





all materials held that are designated confidential and the 
prohibition against disclosing any confidential materials 
absent an order from a court signed by a judge.
