KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Lam Research (LRCX) have canceled their planned $10.6 billion merger. The two semiconductor companies pointed to Justice Department opposition to the deal on antitrust grounds. MetLife (MET) plans to spin-off its U.S. life insurance business to existing shareholders, providing more details on plans announced earlier this year to separate the unit. The spin-off plan does not necessarily preclude a change to a different option such as an IPO. Wal-Mart (WMT) nearly doubled its investment in China-based online retailer JD.com (JD) to 10.8 percent, according to the Wall Street Journal. Separately, Wal-Mart is on track to double the number of giant warehouses dedicated to online sales by year-end. Aiming to compete with Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) is testing a

AT&T (T) has struck a multi-year strategic deal with Amazon Web Services, with the two companies collaborating on cloud and networking capabilities.
