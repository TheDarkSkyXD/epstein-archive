Hi -- you may like an essay I just wrote -- please feel free to forward or =
share.

All the best,
Marc

https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/=20




Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, desp=
ite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effective=
ness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it=E2=80=99s not too =
early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.

Many of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, o=
n one government or another. But the harsh reality is that it all failed =
=E2=80=94 no Western country, or state, or city was prepared =E2=80=94 and =
despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many people within t=
hese institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your favorite political =
opponent or your home nation.

Part of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But the=
 other part of the problem is what we didn=E2=80=99t *do* in advance, and w=
hat we=E2=80=99re failing to do now. And that is a failure of action, and s=
pecifically our widespread inability to *build*.

We see this today with the things we urgently need but don=E2=80=99t have. =
We don=E2=80=99t have enough coronavirus tests, or test materials =E2=80=94=
 including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents. We don=E2=80=99t h=
ave enough ventilators, negative pressure rooms, and ICU beds. And we don=
=E2=80=99t have enough surgical masks, eye shields, and medical gowns =E2=
=80=94 as I write this, New York City has put out a desperate call for rain=
 ponchos to be used as medical gowns. Rain ponchos! In 2020! In America!

We also don=E2=80=99t have therapies or a vaccine =E2=80=94 despite, again,=
 years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses. Our scientists wil=
l hopefully invent therapies and a vaccine, but then we may not have the ma=
nufacturing factories required to scale their production. And even then, we=
=E2=80=99ll see if we can deploy therapies or a vaccine fast enough to matt=
er =E2=80=94 it took scientists 5 years to get regulatory testing approval =
for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourge=E2=80=99s 2014 outbreak, at th=
e cost of many lives.

In the U.S., we don=E2=80=99t even have the ability to get federal bailout =
money to the people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of laid o=
ff workers and their families, and many millions of small businesses, are i=
n serious trouble *right now*, and we have no direct method to transfer the=
m money without potentially disastrous delays. A government that collects m=
oney from all its citizens and businesses each year has never built a syste=
m to distribute money to us when it=E2=80=99s needed most.

Why do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits i=
nvolve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are ha=
rd! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these t=
hings but we chose not to =E2=80=94 specifically we chose not to have the m=
echanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to=
 *build*.

You don=E2=80=99t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with th=
e status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthc=
are generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically through=
out American life.

You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can=E2=
=80=99t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic pot=
ential =E2=80=94 which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in pl=
aces like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to =
move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can=E2=80=99t build the ci=
ties themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CWestw=
orld=E2=80=9D wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn=
=E2=80=99t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin =E2=80=94 they went to =
Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living envir=
onments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where=
 are they?

You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the ca=
pacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year =
olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the worl=
d each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn=E2=80=99t that the most=
 important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of u=
niversities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in=
 K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we=E2=80=99=
ve been doing education research that=E2=80=99s never reached practical dep=
loyment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools usi=
ng everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increas=
e education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect=
); we have the internet; why haven=E2=80=99t we built systems to match ever=
y young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success=
?

You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manu=
facturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing bee=
n offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highl=
y automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we=
 would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know =E2=
=80=94 and we=E2=80=99re experiencing right now! =E2=80=94 the strategic pr=
oblem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods. Why aren=E2=80=99t=
 we building Elon Musk=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Calien dreadnoughts=E2=80=9D =E2=
=80=94 giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceiva=
ble kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible co=
st =E2=80=94 all throughout our country?

You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are =
the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soari=
ng monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?

Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to =
wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent bank=
s, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillio=
n coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I=E2=
=80=99m with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take car=
e of people we don=E2=80=99t know =E2=80=94 all of these fields are highly =
lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist inves=
tment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the =
problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn=E2=80=99t have the =
homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers an=
d smartphones, that we already have.

The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inert=
ia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things.=
 The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build =
these things, even if incumbents don=E2=80=99t like it, even if only to for=
ce the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need t=
o build these things.

And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology =
and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building.

The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The righ=
t is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that ho=
ld back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must=
 fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopol=
ies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of cu=
stomer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-frie=
ndly) innovation.

It=E2=80=99s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political =
support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new in=
dustries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.

The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many o=
f these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that t=
he public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transpo=
rtation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the=
 entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. =
Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge polic=
ies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of =
taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge =E2=80=94 build new things=
 and show the results!

Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and eff=
ective =E2=80=94 how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus =
comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavis=
hed with public funding; why can=E2=80=99t 100,000 or 1 million students a =
year attend Harvard? Why shouldn=E2=80=99t regulators and taxpayers demand =
that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building =E2=80=94 energy e=
xperts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet =
could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so =
let=E2=80=99s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 10=
0? Then the rest?

In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things w=
e build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. =
The things we don=E2=80=99t, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocke=
t in price. What=E2=80=99s the American dream? The opportunity to have a ho=
me of your own, and a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapi=
dly escalating price curves for housing, education, and healthcare, to make=
 sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do tha=
t is to build.

Building isn=E2=80=99t easy, or we=E2=80=99d already be doing all this. We =
need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneur=
s, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. An=
d we need to demand more from one another. We=E2=80=99re all necessary, and=
 we can all contribute, to building.

Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the quest=
ion, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping othe=
r people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of peo=
ple who are building? If the work you=E2=80=99re doing isn=E2=80=99t either=
 leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we=E2=
=80=99ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation,=
 a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstandin=
g people in even the most broken systems =E2=80=94 we need to get all the t=
alent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers t=
o those problems.

I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here=E2=80=99s a modest =
proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, con=
ceive your own! What do you think we should build? There=E2=80=99s an excel=
lent chance I=E2=80=99ll agree with you.

Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our =
forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, th=
en the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of =
other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that def=
ine our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to hono=
r their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and gr=
andchildren, and that=E2=80=99s to build.

ess?</p>=20
<p>You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American m=
anufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing =
been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build hi=
ghly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs=
 we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know =
=E2=80=94 and we=E2=80=99re experiencing right now! =E2=80=94 the strategic=
 problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods. Why aren=E2=80=
=99t we building Elon Musk=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Calien dreadnoughts=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=94 giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conce=
ivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible=
 cost =E2=80=94 all throughout our country?</p>=20
<p>You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where a=
re the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the so=
aring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?</p>=20
<p>Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money =
to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent b=
anks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 tril=
lion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I=
=E2=80=99m with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take =
care of people we don=E2=80=99t know =E2=80=94 all of these fields are high=
ly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist in=
vestment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is t=
he problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn=E2=80=99t have t=
he homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers=
 and smartphones, that we already have.</p>=20
<p>The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is in=
ertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these thin=
gs. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to bui=
ld these things, even if incumbents don=E2=80=99t like it, even if only to =
force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We nee=
d to build these things.</p>=20
<p>And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideolo=
gy and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building.</p>=20
<p>The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The r=
ight is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that=
 hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right m=
ust fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligo=
polies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of=
 customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-f=
riendly) innovation.</p>=20
<p>It=E2=80=99s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised politic=
al support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new=
 industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward.</p>=20
<p>The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in man=
y of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate tha=
t the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better tran=
sportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, =
the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the futur=
e. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge po=
licies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead =
of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge =E2=80=94 build new thi=
ngs and show the results!</p>=20
<p>Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and =
effective =E2=80=94 how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavir=
us comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are la=
vished with public funding; why can=E2=80=99t 100,000 or 1 million students=
 a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn=E2=80=99t regulators and taxpayers dema=
nd that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building =E2=80=94 energ=
y experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the plan=
et could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, =
so let=E2=80=99s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then=
 100? Then the rest?</p>=20
<p>In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The thing=
s we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in pric=
e. The things we don=E2=80=99t, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyro=
cket in price. What=E2=80=99s the American dream? The opportunity to have a=
 home of your own, and a family you can provide for. We need to break the r=
apidly escalating price curves for housing, education, and healthcare, to m=
ake sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do =
that is to build.</p>=20
<p>Building isn=E2=80=99t easy, or we=E2=80=99d already be doing all this. =
We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepren=
eurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society.=
 And we need to demand more from one another. We=E2=80=99re all necessary, =
and we can all contribute, to building.</p>=20
<p>Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the qu=
estion, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping o=
ther people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of =
people who are building? If the work you=E2=80=99re doing isn=E2=80=99t eit=
her leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we=
=E2=80=99ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupati=
on, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstan=
ding people in even the most broken systems =E2=80=94 we need to get all th=
e talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answer=
s to those problems.</p>=20
<p>I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here=E2=80=99s a mode=
st proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, =
conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There=E2=80=99s an ex=
cellent chance I=E2=80=99ll agree with you.</p>=20
<p>Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. O=
ur forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories,=
 then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands =
of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that =
define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to h=
onor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and=
 grandchildren, and that=E2=80=99s to build.</p>
