DECLARATION OF
My name is
and I was born in August, 1983.
I am currently 31 years old.
I grew up in Palm Beach, Florida. When I was little, Iloved animals and wanted
to be a veterinarian. But my life took a very different turn when adults began to be interested in
having sex with me.

Epstein.
I came back for several days following and did the same sorts of sexual things for
8.
So I started "working" exclusively for Epstein. He took me to New York on his
big, private jet. We went to his mansion in New York City. I was shown to my room, a very
luxurious room. The mansion was huge. I got scared because it was so big. Epstein brought me
to a room with a massage parlor. To me, it looked like an S&M parlor. Epstein made me engage
in sexual activities with him there.
9.
You can see how young I looked in the photograph below.

10.
Epstein took me on a ferry boat on one of the trips to New York City and there he
took the picture above. I was approximately 15 or 16 years old at the time.
I was trained to be "everything a man wanted me to be." It wasn't just sexual
training - they wanted me to be able to cater to all the needs of the men they were going to send
me to. They said that they loved that I was very compliant and knew how to keep my mouth
shut.
14.
From very early on I was fearful of Epstein. Epstein told me he was a billionaire.
I told my mother that I was working for this rich guy, and she said "go, go far away." Epstein
had promised me a lot, and I knew if I left I would be in big trouble. I also knew that I was a
witness to a lot of illegal and very bad behavior by Epstein and his friends. If I left Epstein, he
knew all kinds of powerful people. He could have had me killed or abducted, and I always knew
he was capable of that if I did not obey him. He let me know that he knew many people in high
places.
Speaking about himself, he said "I can get away" with things. I was very scared,
particularly since I was a teenager.

To illustrate my connection to these places, I include four photographs taken of
me in New Mexico (shown below). The first one is a museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We
had gone sightseeing for the day. Epstein took this picture of me. I was approximately 17 at the
time, judging from the looks of it. At the end of the day we returned to Epstein's Zorro Ranch.
The second picture is me on one of Epstein's horses on the ranch in New Mexico. The following
two are from wintertime in New Mexico.

17. When I was with him, Epstein had sex with underage girls on a daily basis. His
interest in this kind of sex was obvious to the people around him. The activities were so obvious
5

and bold that anyone spending any significant time at one of Epstein's residences would have
clearly been aware of what was going on.
18.
Epstein's code word for sexual encounters was that it was a "massage". At times
the interaction between Epstein and the girls would start in a massage room setting, it was
always a sexual encounter and never just a massage.

kids - that is, having sexual interactions with many young teenagers at the same time.
Sometimes as many as ten underage girls would participate in a single orgy with them. I
personally observed dozens of these orgies. The orgies happened on Epstein's island in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, in New Mexico, Palm Beach, and many other places. Most of the girls did not
speak English. It was my understanding that the girls had been persuaded to come by Brunel
offering them illegal drugs or a career in modeling. Brunel was one of the main procurers of
girls.
52.
In addition to Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Kellen, and
were also
involved in the orgies. At this stage, I am hopeful that these other women will come forward and
tell the truth about everything because that will help prevent future similar abuse.
53.
I have seen reports saying or implying that I had sex with former President Bill
Clinton on Little Saint James Island. Former President Bill Clinton was present on the Island at
a time when I was also present on the Island, but I have never had sexual relations with Clinton,
nor have I ever claimed to have had such relations. I have never seen him have sexual relations
with anyone.
54.
I now understand that Epstein reached a non-prosecution agreement with the
federal government in 2007 and pled guilty to two state crimes in June 2008. I now know that I
was identified by the federal government as one of Epstein's and his co-conspirator's sexually
abused victims. However, no one told me about those events until after they happened.
55.
On September 3, 2008, the FBI sent a victim notification letter to me. This was
the first written communication I had received from the FBI. The letter is attached as Exhibit 1.
The letter describes an agreement in which compensation would be made victims of Epstein's
12


Case 9:08-CV-80736-KAM Document 291-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/21/2015 Page 14 of
sexual abuse. The letter also said that the federal government was going to "defer federal
prosecution." No one had told me about deferring federal prosecution before this.
56.
In 2011, two FBI agents, called me in Australia and then came to meet me. They
met me at the U.S. Consulate in Sidney. They seemed to be very professional and hard working.
I thought to myself, "Wow, these people will do the right thing against the bad guys and protect
me."
57.
The agents were mainly focused on Epstein but while there I provided them some
information about others who were involved in illegal acts as well. I was aware that a false
statement to these law enforcement officers was a crime and I told the truth - giving them the
information that I could recall about the individuals they inquired about.
58.
Epstein also trafficked me for sexual purposes to many other powerful men,
including politicians and powerful business executives. Epstein required me to describe the
sexual events that I had with these men presumably so that he could potentially blackmail them.
I am still very fearful of these men today.
60.
In this affidavit, I have tried to focus on how I was trafficked for sexual purposes.
I have not described all of the details of the sexual activities Epstein forced me to have. Also, I
have not described all of the details of the other events discussed here. If a judge wants me to
13


Case 9:08-CV-80736-KAM Document 291-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/21/2015 Page 15 of
present my information in more detail, including more specific descriptions of the sexual
activities with the men Epstein sent me to, I could do so.
61. I have directed my attorneys, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, to pursue
all reasonable and legitimate means to have criminal charges brought against these powerful
people for the crimes they have committed against me and other girls. They are representing me
in this case pro bono.
62.
Since I filed my motion in this case, my credibility has been attacked. I am telling
the truth and will not let these attacks prevent me from exposing the truth of how I was trafficked
for sex to many powerful people. These powerful people seem to think that they don't have to
follow the same rules as everyone else. That is wrong. I hope that by coming forward, I can
help expose the problem of sex trafficking and prevent the same sort of abuse and degradation
that happened to me from happening to other girls.
63.
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
Executed this 19 day of January, 2015.

Orseck, P.A., a highly-respected and experienced attorney. You are not
obligated to use Mr. Josefsberg as your civil attorney, but, as explained
in greater detail below, Mr. Josefsberg's services will be provided at no

of the attorney-representative. Also, Mr. Epstein and his attorneys can
only contact you via Mir. Josefsberg, assuming that you would like Mr.
Josefsberg to serve as your attorney.
If you elect to file suit against Mr. Epstein pursuant to Title 18, United
States Code, Section 2255, Mr. Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida
over his person and/or the subject matter, and Mr. Epstein waives his
right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages up
to an amount as agreed to between you and Mr. Epstein, so long as you
elect to procced exclusively under 18 U.S.C. $ 2255, and you waive any
other claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common

any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any criminal or civil
liability.

however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of
