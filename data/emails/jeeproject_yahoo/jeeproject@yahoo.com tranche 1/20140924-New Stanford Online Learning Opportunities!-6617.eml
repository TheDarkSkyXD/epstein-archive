=09=09=09=09=09This six-week course covers fundamental principles of algori=
thm design. Learn the divide-and-conquer design paradigm, with applications=
 to fast sorting, searching, and multiplication. Learn several blazingly fa=
st primitives for computing on graphs, such as how to compute connectivity =
information and shortest paths. Study how allowing the computer to "flip co=
ins" can lead to elegant and practical algorithms and data structures.</td>

an introduction to haptic technology and human haptics, how to program virt=
ual environments, mechanical characterization and simulation, and how to as=
semble mechanical systems, make circuits, and program Arduino-based micro-c=
