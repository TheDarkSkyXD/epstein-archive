The ADP's monthly report on private sector payrolls could be key in determining whether the current bullish attitude holds up after the Wall Street open. The 8:15 a.m. ET report is expected to show U.S. companies added 200,000 in March, compared to 214,000 in February. The government's monthly employment report is out on Friday.Spring home-buying season has kicked into full gear, but it wasn't enough to boost mortgage applications, which fell by 1 percent last week. That was largely due to a drop in refis, which slipped 3 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
