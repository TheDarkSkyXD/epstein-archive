The 8:15 a.m. ET release of the ADP's look at private sector employment kicks off the rest of this week's focus on the labor market. Economists expect 196,000 new jobs were created at U.S. companies in April. Tomorrow, the government issues weekly jobless claims, and then the April jobs report on Friday morning.There are two other major economic reports out this morning: the government's March trade deficit data 8:30 a.m. ET and the ISM's nonmanufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET.  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari is set to moderate a discussion on "too big to fail." The event is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. Kashkari believes banks would still need to be bailed out in another financial crisis even though post-2008 regulations have helped them to become healthier.Another small uptick in
 bond yields last week was again enough to hold borrowers back from applying for a mortgage. Total application volume fell 3.4 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refi demand dropped 6 percent.This afternoon, besides Tesla, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Kraft Heinz (KHC), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Whole Foods (WFM), and Zynga (ZNGA) are among the major after-the-bell earnings reports. STOCKS TO WATCH

Priceline Group (PCLN) reported adjusted quarterly profit of $10.54 per share, outdistancing estimates of $9.65. However, the company's current quarter forecast was well below estimates. Last week, Priceline CEO Darren Huston resigned, following an investigation linked to a personal relationship he had with an employee who was not under his direct supervision.Zillow (Z) lost 13 cents per share for its latest quarter, 4 cents wider than expected, but revenue for the real estate website operator was higher than forecasts as its user base grew. Zillow also increased its revenue forecast for the full year. Etsy (ETSY) earned a penny per share, compared to forecasts for a 2 cent loss. It's the handmade goods seller's first quarterly profit since it went public a year ago. Revenue was also well
 above estimates. Etsy was able to slow down growth in its marketing costs. Match Group (MTCH) reported quarterly earnings of 11 cents per share, 3cents above estimates, while revenue was also above forecasts. The dating service website operator saw its paid member count rise 36 percent above a year ago to 5.1 million, primarily due to growth at its Tinder service. Avis Budget (CAR) posted a 28 cent per share loss for its first quarter, 20 cents wider than expectations. Revenue for the car rental company did match estimates, and its full-year revenue projection was above forecasts as well. Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) saw profit dip to $844 million for its latest quarter, down from $2.3 billion a year ago, due in part to weak sales in Brazil for the beer brewing giant. Anheuser-Busch is in
 the process of buying SABMiller for $100 billion. Cablevision's (CVC) planned acquisition by French telecom company Altice has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission. The $17.7 billion deal still needs the approval of New York State and New York City. The FCC said it found the transaction was in the "public interest." Target (TGT) is tightening deadlines, raising fines for late deliveries, and implementing several other steps regarding its suppliers, according to Reuters, as it tries to improve its competitive position against the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).
