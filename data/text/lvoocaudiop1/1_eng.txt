00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,960 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... So I'm just gonna start recording, and-
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,340 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay.
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:17,860 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Um, so I just wanna clarify in terms of date, July 18th, 2025. My full name, Lisa Noelle Volding,
and Riley, do you wanna state your name and any-
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,130 [ Sascha Riley]
My name is-
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,160 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
-other names?
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,920 [ Sascha Riley]
William... Oh, I'm sorry.
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,320 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No, go ahead.
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,220 [ Sascha Riley]
Go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt. Uh, my name is William Sasha Riley. I was born Manuel
Sasha Barros.
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,980 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,320 [ Sascha Riley]
But my legal name is William Sasha Riley at this time.
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:47,710 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay, and I'm, just so we're clear, I'm based in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. I lived in the
United States full-time for a bunch of years, but I was brought up in Canada. My citizenship's
Canadian.
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:47,760 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay.
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,100 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And-
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,490 [ Sascha Riley]
We might be neighbors-
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:49,560 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
[coughs]
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,860 [ Sascha Riley]
-at some point, because Canada is right now number two on the list of the countries that I am
potentially going to move to. [chuckles]
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:10,000 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]

-- 1 of 47 --

Do you know, I think it's a good place to look. There's a lot of, there's a lot of Americans,
actually. I've spoken to Americans that I've said is... I've told to, to come here, and there's lots
of Americans that have come to visit more, and
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,890 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
it's a lot more embracing, inclusive of a culture, so you know. It's quite lovely.
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:15,960 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah.
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:30,470 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I'd recommend. In terms of what my approach, really what I wanted to do is like, to just really
like a thorough discussion. You tell me everything that, that you've been wanting to say, and I-
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:30,470 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:48,580 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... I'll ask some questions. This might be one of, like, however many, however many discussions,
and I'll record them, if it's one, if it's 10. And what I'd like to do, I'm, I'm sort of recording with
an eye to, A, your testimony, getting your testimony of what you-
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,640 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay
00:01:48,640 --> 00:02:04,120 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... you experienced, what abuse you suffered, and what you were witness to. And an eye in
terms of being able to, to get into a format in terms of affidavits, whether we look at getting
help from the International Criminal Court,
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:22,740 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
'cause obviously what, you know, you and I have discussed already, there's definitely a whole
whack of crimes that, that have been getting committed by a lot of folks, and, um, is even a
case where there could be crimes against humanity charges in regards to Trump.
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,820 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay.
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:55,820 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So, and what else I'd like to do is, is I'd like to look at whether, whether you would be okay with,
you know, me like transcribing and then publishing something. I publish newsletters selectively.
I have a newsletter called Outlaws of Chivalry I pu- publish once in a while, and I was looking at
perhaps publishing there, if you're okay, in terms of how it could help us in terms of, um,
getting the right legal support
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,710 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
in terms of-
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,710 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,000 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... the International War Court.

-- 2 of 47 --

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:14,880 [ Sascha Riley]
I am, I am for whatever puts a light on this, because in my mind, the powers that be have, are
already, uh, aware of my position on it and aware that I have spoken up, and-
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,340 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:35,700 [ Sascha Riley]
... you know, the more light that is shed on there, I don't think that I'm incurring more risk,
except for some maybe lunatic that wants to, uh, [chuckles] be a soldier for Donald Trump,
because they are, uh, a little, a little crazy. They're a little brainwashed, but-
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:35,880 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,180 [ Sascha Riley]
... Um,
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:54,700 [ Sascha Riley]
yeah. I, I, I don't mind whatever would bring a little bit more light to this, particularly this, this
stuff, uh, if, if we can get some of this stuff verified, you know? And I know that me speaking up
is one thing, but then, uh, the verification process-
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,100 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:44,700 [ Sascha Riley]
... uh, you know, is important, too. And I have read about [clears throat] software where, you
know, facial recognition software that, that taps into the, uh, banks of, of known, uh, cataloged
child pornography. So if the, the, the films that they had me make can be verified, uh, you
know, it's not something that I can go online, but I am confident that it's there because
somebody that I served with in the Army got put out of the Army for child pornography, and my
chain of command talked to me and they said, "Hey, you know, some of these images, some of
the films or whatever that he had, look just like you." And that was the first time I think I had
ever talked to anybody about having done those films. And I told them, "Yes, when I was a
child, I had to do those things."
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,440 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,730 [ Sascha Riley]
So I-
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,140 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Well, let's talk a little bit more-
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,190 [ Sascha Riley]
And I-
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,040 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
-about that circumstance. Like, so you were-
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,050 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 3 of 47 --

Okay
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,060 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... in the Army. What years were you in the Army then?
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,240 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, this would've been my second time in the Army. I rejoined in, uh, let's see, 2002.
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,420 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:20,920 [ Sascha Riley]
And I retired in 2016. I was in, uh, from '91 to '98 as well, so I did a little over 21 years. But the
timeframe that, uh, they pulled me into the office and discussed that would've been around, uh,
2008, 2009 timeframe.
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,320 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Hmm.
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,880 [ Sascha Riley]
It was, obviously, it was in garrison, so it was between deployments.
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,300 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:40,480 [ Sascha Riley]
So around that time is when they talked to me. And, yeah, I can just remember, uh... I can
remember telling them that, that I knew it was out there, there was nothing I could do about it,
and
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,540 [ Sascha Riley]
thinking that there was really no way
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,820 [ Sascha Riley]
to go about, you know, anything at that point. You know, I, I didn't know what I could do about
it, if anything.
00:05:51,820 --> 00:06:11,096 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. So it was from when our, our emails, the, um, it was one of the fellow soldiers that was
caught with a bunch of child pornography-... and then your commanding officer pulled you into
the office to go through, and said, "Did I see you in the films?"
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,856 [ Sascha Riley]
I, I didn't. I did not look at any of the films.
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:12,896 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:33,856 [ Sascha Riley]
All they said was, "Hey, we had to look at some of this stuff, and one of those people looks just
like you." And that's the first time that I had, I think, ever really spoken about it, and I said,
"Yes, you know, those are probably me." But I did not personally see them. Um, but

-- 4 of 47 --

00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:39,456 [ Sascha Riley]
they described, uh, something that I knew that I had been a part of.
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:39,776 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:40,896 [ Sascha Riley]
Because they-
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:42,456 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Can you talk about that a little bit more?
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:43,416 [ Sascha Riley]
Here, here's what it was.
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:43,756 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:06:43,756 --> 00:07:06,096 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, y- they... When, when I- they pulled me in, I can remember First Sergeant Bayless was kind
of red-faced, and he said, "Have you ever made a movie with a Black girl?" And I, and, you
know, that obviously was... I mean, I'm not a movie star, so obviously that's a very odd
question, and I knew exactly what he was talking about when he said that.
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:06,495 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:22,196 [ Sascha Riley]
So I said, "Yes." So he said, "Okay, well, we have found some images that are of a sexually
explicit nature on another soldier's, uh, computer, I think, um,
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:40,356 [ Sascha Riley]
and they look like you." And I said, "Well, they are me." So he said, "And you look underage." I
think from that, uh, was part of their investigation to confirm that the images of the, uh, the
participants in these films were underage.
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:40,736 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:07:40,736 --> 00:08:09,736 [ Sascha Riley]
So, you know, that was just a s- a secondary verification that, uh... yeah, I was only 12 or 13 at
the time of that film, maybe, maybe even 11. So I mean, obviously I'm not an adult, and even
when I was an adult, at 18 or 19, I still looked young. So obviously at, uh, 11, 12, uh, what-
whatever I was in that film, I would not have looked like a, a, a mature, uh, an adult, you know?
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:11,116 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:32,665 [ Sascha Riley]
So it was more, I think, for confirmation that these images were of children. So, uh, I don't
remember if he actually got court-martialed or if he just got, uh, UCMJ, which is just their lower
grade of, uh, punishment, but I do know that he was chaptered out of the military over it.

-- 5 of 47 --

00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:32,675 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:46,356 [ Sascha Riley]
I think he might have had to do a little jail time, but I don't, I don't recall. I can't even recall the
soldier's name that got caught with it. I just knew he was a, an NCO, a staff sergeant.
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:55,836 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And was there any... Did anyone else ever talk to you about the, the films again? Did they ever
talk, did, did they ever infer that-
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:55,846 [ Sascha Riley]
No
00:08:55,846 --> 00:09:05,136 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... there was any further investigation in terms to when the films were produced? Did they ask
you anything about who was involved, or did they-
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:05,836 [ Sascha Riley]
No.
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,556 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No.
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:15,256 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, they, they didn't, they didn't go into any legality other than, uh, the prosecution of the
soldier with the images.
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:15,646 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So the-
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:49,915 [ Sascha Riley]
So in the military, it's a little bit different than, than civilian. Uh, you know, I, I don't wanna call
it the court system, 'cause it's just the, the, the officers and NCOs in the military, but they, they
have their, you know, sphere of influence. They have their little scope of operation, and, and if
they uncover more, I think that they're in- uh, required to give it to the civilian authorities, but
they don't have any jurisdiction to go further than to just prosecute the soldier for the infraction
that he is guilty of, if that makes sense the way I'm saying it.
00:09:49,915 --> 00:10:02,636 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No, I understand. Do they have any duty or any... Is there any legality, or do they have legal
requirements to inf- to i- inform civilian prosecutors-
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:02,696 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:03,656 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... of such cases?
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:03,716 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:05,496 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]

-- 6 of 47 --

Okay.
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:23,815 [ Sascha Riley]
If, if, if they suspect or, uh, i- i- I... I- if, if there's additional wrongdoing that is outside of their
scope of, of, of being able to prosecute, and in this case, to, to hold the individual soldier
accountable for having this material that he's not supposed to have-
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:24,435 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:59,516 [ Sascha Riley]
... uh, they prosecute that portion of it. If it is beyond what they can prosecute, then they refer
the soldier to civilian court systems. Um, but in this case, the military did, uh, handle the, uh,
uh, the prosecution of the soldier, and I, I think all he got was, like, 30 days, uh, and, and
reduction in rank to E-1. They kicked him out of the Army and gave him a, [sighs] less than
honorable discharge, I think. I don't think he even got a bad conduct for that.
00:10:59,516 --> 00:10:59,536 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm.
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:26,776 [ Sascha Riley]
But, uh, it... You know, I know that he was put out of the military, and I think he did the... 30
days in jail, I think, is the most that they can give you at the, uh, um, at that, at the level that
they, that they prosecuted him at. So, um, I don't... I'm, I'm not saying that the, uh, you know,
for sure on the, on the jail time, but I do know for a fact he was, he was put out of the military.
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:29,966 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay. So they, they, they had films.
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:29,976 [ Sascha Riley]
Habel.
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:31,546 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
They had some of those films.
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:32,496 [ Sascha Riley]
Habel was his name.
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:33,096 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Cable?
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:35,796 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes, Habel. That was his last name.
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:35,826 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Habel.
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:44,856 [ Sascha Riley]
H-A-B-E-L, I think. Staff Sergeant Habel. I just remembered it. 'Cause I could picture his face,
and I just [chuckles] couldn't remember his name.
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:48,636 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Habel, okay. H-A-B-E-L.

-- 7 of 47 --

00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:52,536 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes, I'm relatively certain on that name.
00:11:52,536 --> 00:12:00,136 [ Sascha Riley]
I, I don't have the best memory. I was in a blast in Iraq, and one of the things that I struggle
with mightily are names.
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:00,536 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:04,236 [ Sascha Riley]
But I am, I'm fairly sure that's his name.
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:22,271 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.... Okay, and in terms of the films they had, so, so the, there was obviously a collection of
pornography. Any- is there anyone you were in contact with of those, your commanding officers
that, would they talk to you? Would they provide evidence-
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:22,332 [ Sascha Riley]
Um.
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:25,072 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Or is it a situation where-
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:39,472 [ Sascha Riley]
I believe Michael, Michael Baylis is the only one that I remember speaking to about it. I have not
spoken to him since I left Fort Carson in 2011. Um,
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:48,752 [ Sascha Riley]
I would think that he would probably remember something like that, just, just the unusualness
of it. You know, first sergeants deal with
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:59,590 [ Sascha Riley]
things day in and day out, but I would, I would think that he would remember that just because
of how it's not every day that you have to deal with something like that, you know? Um-
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:01,311 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:19,872 [ Sascha Riley]
But it, it is possible. Uh, I think my commanding officer's name at that time was Captain
Colasanto, but I'm not sure because you get... Commanding officers come and go. You know,
the first sergeants, uh, they, they tend to stick around longer.
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:20,021 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:25,592 [ Sascha Riley]
But commanding officers are, a lot of times they're only there for a year or two, and then
they're off to the next thing, so.
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:26,311 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.

-- 8 of 47 --

00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:30,252 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, my recollection of the commanding officer may not be accurate.
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:34,952 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
What's the, the spelling of his last name, Colasanto?
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:40,051 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, Cola, C-O-L-A-S-A-N-T-O.
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:44,592 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay. St. Cola. [laughing]
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,811 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah.
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:59,232 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay, is there anything else you think would be helpful to, to talk about right now, about then,
the timeframe? That was the first time anyone had ever mentioned to you anything about the
films other than
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:02,632 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
when you were involved in filming?
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:03,762 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Is that accurate?
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:03,811 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:04,692 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:50,692 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes. The, the first time that I can recall anybody, that it ever coming up. I always knew that
they were, um, you know, that the films, at, at, at least one or two of them were out there. I
don't even know how many times I was filmed. Um, uh, but I can tell you that, that some of
them are, are extraordinarily horrible. I can give you one instance where they were filming us, it
was me and a girl that I knew, uh, that I had been trafficked with, uh, in other venues, and while
we were filming, uh, they came in and shot her in the head. So killed her, obviously. So that
would be, uh-
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:54,112 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Was that the runaway?
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:55,291 [ Sascha Riley]
That was another girl.
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:55,551 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Another girl.
00:14:55,551 --> 00:15:34,051 [ Sascha Riley]
I can't even remember her name. Yeah. The, the runaway was tortured to death in a duplex in,
uh, Enterprise, Alabama. My parents did that, but, and we had... That wasn't on film, uh, the,

-- 9 of 47 --

not her t- her being tortured, but, uh, that was, uh, that was that Black girl that I'm telling you
about that, that later on, uh, Michael Baylis had talked to me about. But they went and got her
because they were afraid that, that... Th- this was after the investigation in Tennessee, and
they were afraid that, that they would go down for child pornography.
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:34,071 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:15:34,071 --> 00:16:20,571 [ Sascha Riley]
So they were wanting to kill her, and then they were wanting to get rid of me via an accident,
but they couldn't because they had already tried to kill me several times. They had the incident
in Texas involving a Chevy van. There was another inci- instance in Texas where my dad threw
me into the middle of a pool and said, "Sink or swim," and somebody saw it and called the
sheriff, so there was a police report on that. And then there was a third instance in Texas where
they, uh, my dad threw me down a flight of stairs, and that one fractured my skull. Now, there
may have been other things that happened as well, but I remember those three were, uh, uh,
enough that they generated an investigation.
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:20,712 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:36,031 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, there were enough things that happened in Texas that, uh, my dad moved from Texas to
Tennessee, and then got in trouble in Tennessee, and then moved... Then got in trouble in
Tennessee, and then moved to Alabama, got in trouble in Alabama, and then we just moved
one more time.
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,172 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And you're talking about your-
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:37,651 [ Sascha Riley]
Alabama
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:41,872 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... your adoptive dad, William Kyle Riley, correct?
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:42,391 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:42,811 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:56,952 [ Sascha Riley]
I don't, I have, um, I have located my birth parents. My birth mother lives in Sierra Vista, and
my birth father lives in Edmond, Oklahoma, but I have, as yet, I have not reached out to either
of them.
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:57,752 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:03,790 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, I, I just, within the last year, probably six months, I learned where they live.

-- 10 of 47 --

00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,031 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:10,212 [ Sascha Riley]
So, uh, that, I don't know. That's just an odd
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:19,771 [ Sascha Riley]
dynamic for me, and I'm still kind of processing that. Uh, but as far as family goes, I have a
half-sister up in, uh, uh, Massachusetts-
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:19,781 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,412 [ Sascha Riley]
... and that's about it.
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:28,712 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay. And your adoptive dad, William Kyle Riley, worked as a pilot and was involved-
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:29,672 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:32,112 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... in to grieving and the Epstein trial.
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:33,252 [ Sascha Riley]
He was involved in all kinds of things.
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:33,752 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:33,802 [ Sascha Riley]
Um-
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,252 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And he worked a lot with Trump-
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:35,391 [ Sascha Riley]
He
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:37,851 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... and Epstein, correct?
00:17:37,851 --> 00:18:12,412 [ Sascha Riley]
He, I, I know that he was around Epstein and worked with Epstein, and I want to say that he
flew for Epstein, and if not for Epstein directly, um, like transporting Epstein himself, he did
transport some of the rich people to and from, uh, these parties that Epstein and company
hosted. It's, it wasn't just him. It was kind of a cabal of several people, and Epstein was the, I
guess, the lead coordinator, maybe you would call it.
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:12,452 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:28,052 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 11 of 47 --

But it, it's much more than just-... him as an individual, you know? It was people like him, like
Trump, uh, other people, um, and I can't remember, you know, like how many, but he was,
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:50,292 [ Sascha Riley]
he, he was handy to have around because he was a part of the process, and he isn't just a, uh,
like an airline pilot or something like that. He, he can fly anything. He can fly helicopters, uh,
fixed wing, uh, smaller aircraft, larger aircraft. I mean, he's, he's, a, um, you know, he's that
pilot that kind of that
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:55,452 [ Sascha Riley]
multipurpose guy that could transport whatever you needed.
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:56,481 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay, so it was-
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:57,112 [ Sascha Riley]
And I don't-
00:18:57,112 --> 00:18:57,992 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:18:57,992 --> 00:19:14,112 [ Sascha Riley]
I don't know if he ever got into the drugs. I can remember him talking at one point, and he had
refused to do a drug run, basically, and somebody else took that drug run, and they got busted.
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:14,372 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:19:14,372 --> 00:20:10,332 [ Sascha Riley]
So I don't, I don't know what kind of aircraft it was or whatever, and it was around Florida that
that guy got busted, and maybe he flew down, uh, to the Virgin Islands or something like that. I,
I can't remember the specific details, but I can remember the conversation that my dad had,
talking about, "Thank God I didn't take that," and because the guy got busted, and he wound
up, you know, huge amount of charges, 25 to life or whatever the heck he got. But I can
remember from his perspective, being nervous because the people that he was working with,
he was scared that they were gonna set him up to take the fall for something, to just get rid of
him because he had been involved in so much other criminality that he was really nervous
about taking on anything else. I, I, I, I know that's kind of word salad the way that I said it, but I,
I think you kind of understand what I'm saying.
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:22,472 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I do. No, I understand. I understand perfectly. So your dad [chuckles] would obviously... You
know, my understanding is your, your dad was the kind of pilot that
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:27,852 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
those sort of criminals would want to use 'cause they could use him to fly any- anything in any
situation-
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:27,862 [ Sascha Riley]
Yep
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:33,092 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... to airlift Trump out, like you said, when you almost killed Trump, when Trump was assaulted-

-- 12 of 47 --

00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:34,092 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah, I mean, that-
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:36,012 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Or fly guests in.
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:37,172 [ Sascha Riley]
I don't think my dad was the pilot in that one, but, but-
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:38,802 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
He wasn't the pilot in that case?
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:39,952 [ Sascha Riley]
... Yeah, that kind of pilot, absolutely.
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:40,332 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:41,592 [ Sascha Riley]
I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt, but-
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:47,892 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No, no. That's okay. So yeah, I've got... You know,
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:55,592 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I've s- spoken to folks that, you know, they look for those sorts of pilots. They want pilots that
can get
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,252 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
guests-
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:56,352 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
00:20:56,352 --> 00:21:09,812 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... traffickers into situations, in and out discreetly, trafficking victims in and out of situations
discreetly, and victims that they've killed out of situations discreetly, all sorts of nonsense. So
seems like-
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:21,852 [ Sascha Riley]
And, and that's what, that's what he did. He, he shuttled the people, but I can remember him
not wanting to, to cross the bridge over to running drugs.
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:22,432 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:33,452 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, because in his mind, if he got caught with some people, he could just play dumb,
and, "I was just transporting this guy's kid to, you know, from the, you know, here to there. I, I-"
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:33,482 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Right
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:36,112 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 13 of 47 --

... "didn't know anything." So-
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:36,932 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So did your dad-
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:39,292 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, I, I, I... Go ahead.
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,651 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I was... Did your dad
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:45,732 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
tr- mo- transport the victims
00:21:45,732 --> 00:21:46,632 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
most often?
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:47,752 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes. Oh, absolutely.
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:48,112 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So-
00:21:48,112 --> 00:21:48,532 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh-
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:52,422 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... more victims than guests? I don't wanna call them guests.
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,812 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, both. I would say more guests than, than victims.
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:54,832 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:58,072 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, but he definitely transported both.
00:21:58,072 --> 00:22:00,332 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:00,942 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:01,062 [ Sascha Riley]
And he, he, he-
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:10,232 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And that was either directly for Epstein, like transport... Wasn't transporting Epstein so much as
Epstein's victims and Epstein's guests.
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:11,372 [ Sascha Riley]
And the clients.

-- 14 of 47 --

00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:11,632 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And clients.
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:11,812 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:13,792 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
The clients.
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,652 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, but he was definitely around Epstein. I can-
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:16,662 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:44,452 [ Sascha Riley]
... I can remember the one time that I can remember meeting both of them, and I, I can't even
remember Jeffrey hardly at all, but I can remember the conversation in the car where they, they
kept asking how to say, uh, Ghislaine's name because it was unusual, and, uh, during that
meeting, uh, my mom wanted to get the name right, you know, for whatever. That was
important to her, you know?
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:48,372 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah, and what's your mom's name again?
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:51,571 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, her name was Mary Lynn Riley. This would be-
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:51,802 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mary Lynn Riley
00:22:51,802 --> 00:23:02,832 [ Sascha Riley]
... kind of my third mom because my, my dad adopted me with a, uh, a lady na- named, uh, I-
Irene Ursula Lipsky was her maiden name.
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:03,011 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:31,692 [ Sascha Riley]
Her name is Peter now. Um, but those two adopted me. He got divorced from Irene in, uh, '79 or
'80 and almost immediately married Lynn. So, uh, Irene may have been involved in some of
that, but that would be from a timeframe that I don't have clear recollection of. I do have clear
recollection of Mary Lynn Riley's involvement, uh, but she died via suicide a number of years
ago.
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:34,992 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Oh, okay.
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:41,452 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Now, um,
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:46,592 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
what are you most comfortable to talk about next? I mean, well, let me ask some more

-- 15 of 47 --

questions-
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:46,682 [ Sascha Riley]
I, I can-
00:23:46,682 --> 00:23:56,831 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... in terms of the... Now, you, you told me about Trump and about Biggs and about Jordan. I
feel like that's important to discuss some details, and, uh-
00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:56,842 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay
00:23:56,842 --> 00:24:16,192 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... let me ask you a question. Do you think it's more helpful for you to talk about what you
remember first, when you were first trafficked, the circumstances, individuals involved, or do
you wanna talk about some of the incidents that, that we spoke about a bit by email already?
What's, what do you think is more helpful for you?
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:29,323 [ Sascha Riley]
... fill in whatever gaps in, in that, that I can. Um, I have spoken to you about most of what I
remember clearly, but I can, I can give you some of the details
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:36,464 [ Sascha Riley]
with those three, and that's why, that's why I, I am willing to talk about them.
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:36,474 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:24:36,474 --> 00:25:22,803 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, there's no, um, uh, I, I remember more things, but I just can't, I can't g- I can't give
you much in the way of detail for anybody other than those three. I can remember Jim Jordan. I
went to a party. This was at a farm. There were, uh, I don't know, twenty-five to fifty people
there. I mean, it was, it was a good amount of people, but not a, a, a massive crowd by any
stretch. But what my... The experience that my dad sold to those people was, if you could pin
me, then you could do whatever you wanted, but my dad had taught me how to fight. He had
been a, like, a bare-knuckle brawler earlier in his, uh, life, and, uh, I know that he had
00:25:22,803 --> 00:26:01,083 [ Sascha Riley]
worked kind of just beating people up for, you know, a little extra money at one point in his life.
Uh, he, he also, uh, entered into, like, the Tough Man contest, stuff like that. So it, it was kind of
a game for them because I was just a child, so you would think that you could just, uh, you
know, do whatever you wanted, but if they got anywhere near me, I would hit them. And by the
time that Jim Jordan assaulted me, I was old enough that those adults, not being, most of them
not being athletic in any way, you know, these are, these are people that, you know, they're not
fighters by any stretch.
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:01,543 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:21,984 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, they, they couldn't get anywhere near me, and Jim Jordan just sort of rushed me and
tackled me, and I might have known how to fight, but I didn't know how to wrestle. So he
assaulted me in front of a crowd, and I, I think that it was filmed, but I can't swear that it was

-- 16 of 47 --

filmed, but it was in front of those twenty-five or fifty people. Um-
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:22,543 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And how old were you?
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:27,783 [ Sascha Riley]
That's why I remembered. I was
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:29,283 [ Sascha Riley]
around twelve.
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,323 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Twelve.
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,303 [ Sascha Riley]
When that happened.
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:33,583 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And of those twenty-five, fifty people-
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:33,592 [ Sascha Riley]
And the reason that-
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,724 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Oh, sorry, go ahead.
00:26:35,783 --> 00:27:38,303 [ Sascha Riley]
The reason that I remember Jim Jordan is, first, he stood out because he wasn't that much...
He's, he's only, like, seven or eight years older than me, so at the timeframe that I'm, I, I'm at
twelve, he is right around just graduating high school, maybe, maybe first year or two of
college, right? So him being so much younger stood out, and then I remembered his jawline. He
has a very, uh, very pronounced jawline. I remembered his voice, and he ha- his mannerisms
haven't changed throughout his life either. So when I really started, uh, as soon as Trump went
down that escalator and said he was running for president, I st- I got, I got involved in politics.
You know, I started, I started watching it. Uh, I started watching who supported him and
everything like that, and I remembered Jim Jordan just from watching him on the, uh, uh, floor
of Congress, you know, speaking to the different people that, you know, go on, go up there and
testify. So,
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:44,664 [ Sascha Riley]
uh, and, and, and that's him, you know? I, I just remembered him. So-
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:44,884 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:27:44,884 --> 00:27:55,103 [ Sascha Riley]
That's- I know that's not a lot, but [chuckles] if you give me a polygraph, I'm gonna take it
because it's, I'm a hundred percent sure that, that it was him.
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:55,724 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:27:55,724 --> 00:28:39,864 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 17 of 47 --

And Andy Biggs I remember because on the way to this, they took me to a, a house. This wasn't
at a party. This was later after I had assaulted Trump, and it was kind of a punishment type of
thing, where he was gonna get to assault me and I guess not pay my parents, and he got to do
whatever he wanted. And I can remember telling me they... I wasn't allowed to fight back or
they'd kill me and, you know, all of this, but they, they must have said his name fifty times in
the car. So Biggs kept, I, I kept hearing Biggs, Andy Biggs, Biggs, and I, I thought, "I'm going to
remember this name." And
00:28:39,864 --> 00:29:46,024 [ Sascha Riley]
after he assaulted me, I don't even remember the, the assault necessarily, but I remember
being in the car afterwards and being, like, uh, really nauseous, sick to my stomach. I was
seeing spots and, I mean, uh, the guy beat me until I, I had broken ribs and, and was
convulsing, turning blue, and stuff like that. And I can r- the only part of that assault that I can
remember is laying on the, uh, floor of, of the room trying to breathe, and I could, I could hear
Andy and my dad screaming back and forth at each other. And I can remember Andy Biggs
saying, "You said I could do whatever I wanted," and my dad saying, "I didn't say you could
fucking kill him." And, you know, I think they may have actually thrown blows over it, but there
was a heated argument and everything going on for, for an extended period of time, and then I
can remember being in the car, leaving, and just having my eyes closed because my head was
spinning and everything, and I was just trying to breathe, just in and out, you know?
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:46,264 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:29:46,264 --> 00:30:00,422 [ Sascha Riley]
So that's why I remember him so clearly. Uh, I have had more than one encounter with Trump,
and that's why I tried to kill that son of a bitch, because he is a fucking monster. It's why I have
not shut up about just how
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:06,603 [ Sascha Riley]
absolutely abhorrent he is as a human being, and it's why I tried to, that's why I tried to kill him.
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:07,103 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:32,175 [ Sascha Riley]
Because I had decided I had already seen enough other people die, that in my mind, I thought,
uh, "Well, they're just gonna kill me too at some point, right? Uh, you know, I'm not going to
survive to be an adult from this."... so in my mind, he was the biggest pile of shit that I had ever
had to have any contact with, so I was gonna take him with me. And I-
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:38,196 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
How often did Trump assault you? Do you remember?
00:30:38,196 --> 00:31:51,735 [ Sascha Riley]
I can remember, I can remember two specifically, a third one that I think, and I think I was
around him more than those, just those three times, but only three times do, do I kind of
remember. I can remember at one point him asking, uh, the people that were kind of running
that party or, or whatever it was at that farm, um, he wanted to kill somebody. He wanted to,
he wanted to murder somebody. And they said, "Hey, that's not this kind of party. You can't do
that." And, uh, they s- and in lieu of doing that, they said, "Well, we've got some, some puppies
if you just wanna kill something. We've gotta get rid of them anyway." So I can remember him
taking those puppies one by one, and, like, he snapped one of the puppies' necks, he cut one

-- 18 of 47 --

open and let it just howl and, and, and, you know, writhe in pain while it died. Held one under
some water to kill it. Uh, he just, he, he wanted to hurt, kill those puppies in, in, you know,
whatever gruesome way, you know, to s- to experience, I guess, seeing them suffer in different
ways. What his
00:31:51,735 --> 00:32:29,456 [ Sascha Riley]
kink is, I guess if you wanna call it that, is watching people suffer. He likes to destroy people
physically, mentally, during the process of the assault. That's why he stands out so much in my
memory. You know, and it's, it's, it's physical pain, and then it's, it's also, you know, degrading
and, and, and all of that. But his thing was to just try to destroy human beings to the, to the
utmost that he could possibly do it, which is why I attacked him.
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:36,396 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
[sighs] Yeah, that's understandable. So, um-
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:50,436 [ Sascha Riley]
I can tell you this, the, the last one I... And, and, [sighs] okay, so this was after they had killed
the, uh, Samantha. This was the Black girl that I made the, the, the, one of the movies with.
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,136 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,106 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, and this was that party-
00:32:52,106 --> 00:33:02,776 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And these were... Let me just ask a question just to clarify. So when Samantha was killed, these
were, were all of these parties at the farm or similar locations to the farm,
00:33:02,776 --> 00:33:03,476 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
where there was m-
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:05,876 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, it was multiple farms, but-
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:06,876 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Multiple farms
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:07,576 [ Sascha Riley]
... but most-
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:08,176 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And usually-
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:08,296 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:15,456 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... it was parties, so there was individuals like Trump that were flown in to the parties, and then-
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:15,466 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes

-- 19 of 47 --

00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:15,516 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... the vic-
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:37,116 [ Sascha Riley]
And they would have, like, a building, you know, a house, uh, and they would usually have, like,
a tent set up, and, uh, you know, it, it was almost like a little, uh, c- I don't wanna say a fair, it
wasn't that big. They didn't have rides or anything, but there was... It was a kind of a
coordinated deal, you know?
00:33:37,176 --> 00:34:21,536 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, sometimes they would have the, uh, the bare-knuckle fighting. That's, that probably is how
my, my dad got involved with these people because, uh, you know, you've got boxing and stuff
like that on TV, but that's really all you had back in the '70s and '80s. The, the, you know, the
more, the MMA type of stuff wasn't allowed, and these fights were a little more gruesome. They
didn't, they didn't fight to the death or anything like that, but they were, they were bloody and,
you know, I mean, these were, these were fights, you know, and not just boxing. And so the,
the, uh, rich people would pay to see that. Sometimes they'd have, like, a, a, you know, a band
playing, uh, you know, just, just like what you would expect at, like, a fair or something, you
know, just a-
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:25,056 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So the rich folks would get flown in, associated with-
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:25,205 [ Sascha Riley]
Mm-hmm
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:33,835 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... Epstein, and they would pay to watch the victims fight. The vic- victims were all underage,
and would they pay-
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:33,855 [ Sascha Riley]
Mm
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:37,996 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... to then assault the victims after the fights or during the fights?
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:38,016 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:38,876 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And they paid to-
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:38,886 [ Sascha Riley]
Um
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:41,376 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... to torture the victims and rape the victims-
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:42,016 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:43,016 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... and kill the victims?

-- 20 of 47 --

00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:46,616 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, but now, now some of the fights were adults, you know?
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:46,656 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Oh.
00:34:46,656 --> 00:35:39,756 [ Sascha Riley]
So, you know, if they had some big old country boy and some other guy, they, they would pay
to see that. They would also pay to watch the kids fight, and they did pay to watch me fight. I
would fight other kids, and my dad was, was my initial trainer, uh, for me to learn how to fight. I
would later, uh, go on to be a, a, a boxer, an amateur boxer, but that's how I got my start in all
of that. So yes, they would have paid for that. Um, and the experiences were different, uh, each
time. There wasn't, like, a set thing. You never really knew what was gonna happen. So, um,
you know, a part of it, a, a lot of it just comes down to money, you know? So if they offered, uh,
$5,000 to have sex with me, then, then, you know,
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:42,856 [ Sascha Riley]
uh, my dad was willing to do that.
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:42,886 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:45,276 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, whatever the dollar amounts were, I don't, I don't know.
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:50,956 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Sex, that isn't, that isn't sex. That, that's, that's sexual assault.
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,496 [ Sascha Riley]
Right.
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:52,826 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I mean-
00:35:52,826 --> 00:35:53,046 [ Sascha Riley]
But-
00:35:53,046 --> 00:35:57,196 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... I, I just wanna say something first. I think-
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:57,556 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:40,280 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... you're extremely brave, and you behave extremely strong, like a warrior, and I just wanna
stop and say it's important to me to say that, because a lot of folks, you know, wouldn't even
survive such trauma. But you've, you've survived, and you, you know, you conduct yourself
with, with dignity and, and, and gracefully, and, and I... It is important to me to say that. I h- I
hope you know that. You know, I hope you-... have a sense of your, your own honor and
chivalrousness, especially what you told me in terms of drugs they used on you, and how they
lured you, drugged to, to, to behave monstrous towards other kids. You know, I understand
that-

-- 21 of 47 --

00:36:40,280 --> 00:37:36,140 [ Sascha Riley]
Well, I can remember... I, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but I can remember, uh, some
law, some arm of law enforcement showing me video of me harming one of the people that
they were filming me with. Now, I don't know how that came about, um, wh- whether they, they
drugged me a- and I lost my mind, or they told me to do it. I don't, I don't know the
circumstances, but I can remember being in that room and them saying, "Well, you did this."
And, and it may have not even been law enforcement. It may have been, you know, like the
people that were running that. But I can remember being really upset because I had no
recollection of having done that. It was me in the video, and I was beating somebody, well, a
girl senseless. And, uh, I didn't kill her or anything like that, but I, I, you know.
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,460 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,040 [ Sascha Riley]
So... And I have a feeling,
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:57,400 [ Sascha Riley]
you know, this, this part I can't prove because I, I, you know, I, I have, I only have my own
experiences, but what the whole thing seems to be is that they first abuse you, then they get
you on film abusing others, and now they have you trapped as well.
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,740 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:13,180 [ Sascha Riley]
So you can't talk about the abuse that they did to you. If they want you to be a legacy victim,
somebody that they can use in the future, well, then they've got to get you on tape doing
monstrous things to other people as well, because now they have the leverage to keep your
mouth shut.
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,390 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. No, and you know what?
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:14,400 [ Sascha Riley]
And I, I-
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:54,880 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
You're exactly right. That's exactly the tactic, and it's, it's ins- the tactic is insidious because,
um... Have, have you ever heard of the, the, the torture technique a lot of, um, occult
practitioners use? It's called, uh, inversion. Inversion torture, inversion magic. Isn't magic,
sorcery is just smoke and mirrors, nonsense, deception techniques. But a sort of inversion
technique where to try to linguistically manipulate the victims, to try to get the victims in a
position where the victims doubt whether the victims, you know-
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,090 [ Sascha Riley]
Oh, absolutely
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,340 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... are good or not. That's-
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,280 [ Sascha Riley]
Absolutely.

-- 22 of 47 --

00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,460 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And I think that's the case-
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:58,470 [ Sascha Riley]
They-
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:05,400 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... with a lot of the Republicans you mentioned. Like you said, Clarence Thomas and Lindsey
Graham were at these parties. You can't remember if-
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:05,520 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:19,680 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... Lindsey Graham and Clarence Thomas participated. And it's sort of a question of did they
participate? Were they blackmailed because they were there, attended the parties, but they
didn't participate? Can you tell me much more about Clarence Thomas and Lindsey Graham?
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:53,240 [ Sascha Riley]
I, ca- I know the least about him. The only reason that I can remember him is because he was a
Black man. And, uh, uh, I'm, I'm sorry, but that, that, that club is, is pretty much just white
folks, so having a Black person there, uh, was very unusual, so he stood out. But the only thing
that I can really say is that I remembered him being there, and then I remember what a big deal
it was in our household when he got confirmed onto the Supreme Court.
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,800 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:06,040 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, because my dad was excited about that because of how high up he was. Now, I don't... I
can't swear. I may have been assaulted by Clarence Thomas, but I cannot swear to that.
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,310 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:13,040 [ Sascha Riley]
Uh, if he did assault me, then it was not to the level of something that
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,440 [ Sascha Riley]
scared me to the point where I needed to remember it, i- if that's a good way to put that, which-
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,030 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:52,080 [ Sascha Riley]
... Rob rose to that, and Andy Biggs rose to that, and Jim Jordan rose to that because he was
dangerous to me, because I could keep most people away from me with my fists, but, you
know, he, he was a good wrestler. So, you know, he scared me in that sense that this is a
person that I can't, you know, that I can't keep away from me with my, with my fists. Um,
Lindsey Graham, I am fairly sure he has assaulted me, but I just can't put my hand on a Bible
and swear to that.
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,320 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]

-- 23 of 47 --

Yeah.
00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:10,660 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, I know that he was there. I can remember it. Uh, he, he just like, uh, Jim Jordan, he
has, uh, very distinct mannerisms, and his voice is a little unusual as well. So I could remember
his voice, I could remember his mannerisms, and then obviously how he looks. Um,
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:19,620 [ Sascha Riley]
so I can put him there, but I just can't... I can't say he did this or he did that exactly. I just can't.
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,240 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay. So-
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:31,890 [ Sascha Riley]
I, I wish that I could provide more information on that because I, I, I think some things went on,
but that's just not enough for me to point, uh, a finger and make an accusation.
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:31,900 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,940 [ Sascha Riley]
But, uh, he was there, I can tell you that.
00:41:33,940 --> 00:42:01,340 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. Well, that's, that's, that's enough, and I know that, you know, some sorts of interviews,
there's, we can look at at a different time to see if there is any more information you
remember. But what you do remember, I, I just want you to know, what you remember to know,
that what, what you remember is extremely important and is extremely helpful. I know you
want to be able to remember more, and the memories are in there, and, you know, I, I just
wanna approach the situation-
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:01,350 [ Sascha Riley]
But-
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,660 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... delicately 'cause, you know, you've been through a lot.
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,780 [ Sascha Riley]
Some of the other memories are, are, are just vague.
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:09,790 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:44,308 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, I can... And, and, and I, I have been very careful, too, not to, to, to, to reach out
further because there are some other names that I could, I could mention that I believe were
there, that I know for a fact that, that my parents talked about, but-... like I can tell you a
hundred percent sure that they talked about Vladimir Putin, but I do not believe he was ever at
one of those parties that I was at. But his name was, uh, brought up more than once.
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:47,247 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
During the 1980s?

-- 24 of 47 --

00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:47,888 [ Sascha Riley]
And I- Yes.
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:49,548 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:57,247 [ Sascha Riley]
Vladimir Putin. I don't, I don't know even when he ascended to the presidency, but I remember
the name because it was so unusual. Now,
00:42:57,247 --> 00:43:18,008 [ Sascha Riley]
a- at that point, he may have just been, you know, one of the Russian oligarchs or whatever,
but his name came up, and, and I remember just 'cause it's an unusual name, Vladimir Putin,
you know? Um, but I don't believe he was ever there. So that is like... I, I don't know, it's- there
are other names like that, too.
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:18,647 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:43:18,647 --> 00:43:18,727 [ Sascha Riley]
Um-
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:20,397 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Let's talk a little bit about Putin more.
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:24,066 [ Sascha Riley]
I, I remember the Clinton name being brought up, but I don't ever remember seeing him.
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:28,267 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So Clinton was mentioned, but you never saw Clinton?
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:31,207 [ Sascha Riley]
I, not that I can recall.
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:45,787 [ Sascha Riley]
And, and that's another thing, too. I may have had interactions with additional people, but
some- during some of them, I was so drugged out of my mind, I, I don't really remember what
happened, you know?
00:43:45,787 --> 00:43:55,787 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. When, when you heard them talk about Putin, so it was at one of the parties at one of the
farms, do you remember what they were saying about Putin?
00:43:55,787 --> 00:44:10,968 [ Sascha Riley]
Just that he was some sort of, like, a foreigner that was very important. I d- I, you know, I didn't
know any more... You know, the, the name was just unusual, and
00:44:10,968 --> 00:44:48,928 [ Sascha Riley]
they, they mentioned his name. You know, they, they kind of, uh, had fun saying his name, you
know, Vladimir, you know, uh, "Does he like to go by Vlad?" or this or that, but the, the meeting
with that person I don't think ever materialized. I think it was just something that was discussed
and never happened. Now, if he has other connections, you know, he, and he, he very well may,
uh, that's possible, but I can just remember there were, at those parties, there were people that

-- 25 of 47 --

had strange accents.
00:44:48,928 --> 00:44:49,848 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
00:44:49,848 --> 00:45:07,328 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, but that's, that's it. That's, that's all I could say. I couldn't point and say, "Well, this person
was from Spain, or this person was from Portugal." I, I have no idea. But what I do know for a
fact is not every person at those parties was American.
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:09,446 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:13,207 [ Sascha Riley]
I know that's not a lot, but I, again, I, I-
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:13,218 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Did you-
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:14,587 [ Sascha Riley]
... I only remember what I, what I remember.
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:31,048 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I have a question. With, with Trump, I mean, with Putin, did you get the sense that the party
attendees, that the clients were interested in Putin? There was something they wanted from
Putin, they thought they could get money from Putin, influence from Putin?
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:31,087 [ Sascha Riley]
They-
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:33,787 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Did you have any sense of that?
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:43,408 [ Sascha Riley]
The only sense that I had was that this was for, uh, the rich people, regardless of where they
were from.
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:43,698 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:45:43,698 --> 00:46:03,328 [ Sascha Riley]
So at this point in my child brain, I knew that there were rich people, and those people got to do
whatever they wanted, and then there were poor people, like me, and those people... You
know, that was the dynamic. So, you know, that's, that's, that's it. I,
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:25,207 [ Sascha Riley]
I never heard them say anything about blackmailing and, and stuff like that, but I can
remember them showing me a video of me doing bad stuff, and then I can remember people
telling me that if I ever talked about it, what I had done was illegal, too, by... Uh, and, and a lot
of that was just bullshit because I was just a kid, and they were making me do this stuff.
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:25,537 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. [chuckles]

-- 26 of 47 --

00:46:25,537 --> 00:46:26,707 [ Sascha Riley]
But-
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:27,348 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Talk about-
00:46:27,348 --> 00:46:27,848 [ Sascha Riley]
You know
00:46:27,848 --> 00:46:30,167 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... malevolent hypocrisy. Dude-
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:30,178 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:40,428 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... they were just utterly grotesque. They, they were trafficking you, they were assaulting you,
they were drugging you, and then they were trying to, to, to-
00:46:40,428 --> 00:46:42,988 [ Sascha Riley]
They, they, they were trying to make me feel guilty about any of it happening.
00:46:42,988 --> 00:46:46,328 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Psychologically torturing you. Exactly, exactly. When they... You were-
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:46,337 [ Sascha Riley]
And I, I-
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:50,207 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
-in a situation because they were trafficking you.
00:46:50,207 --> 00:47:03,388 [ Sascha Riley]
The, the last encounter with Trump, the one where I injured him, was the one that I remember
the most vividly, and, uh, this was the setup for that. I can remember
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:08,048 [ Sascha Riley]
my dad, before we went to the farm, this was when we lived in Enterprise, Alabama.
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:08,287 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:24,488 [ Sascha Riley]
So it would've been about '81 to '82, somewhere in there, maybe as, maybe as late as '83. But
he said, "There may be somebody that you know there," and, and I can remember the look on
his face, and it scared the shit out of me.
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:24,667 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm.
00:47:24,667 --> 00:48:24,308 [ Sascha Riley]
But anyway, when I got to the farm, of course, I'm scared at the farm because I don't know
what's going to happen, but the first person that comes up to me is a girl named Patricia. This is
a girl that I had been trafficked with before, and she came running up to me and, you know,

-- 27 of 47 --

said, said hello or whatever. Uh, she was about my same age, around 12 or 13, and I can
remember my dad saying, "Well, why don't you guys go run off and, and, or whatever, and, and
have fun?" And I c- I can re- I can remember not knowing what to do in that instance because,
you know, these parties weren't for me. I wasn't... And then, then he, then he said something to
the effect of, "No, y- y- it's not like that for you anymore. You're a man now. You can just go out
and have fun." Well, we went to go have sex, so, [chuckles] uh, we went and found a room and
started having sex, and
00:48:24,308 --> 00:49:07,196 [ Sascha Riley]
w- while we were having sex, people burst into the room. It would've been four, five, six guys,
big guys, adults.... at least one of them had a gun. I think, I think two or three of them had
guns. But they came in, they assaulted her, they beat on her, and then they shot her while she
was still in the bed. They didn't beat or assault me, but what they said was, "If you don't do
everything that the next person coming in here wants, we're gonna shoot you just like we did
her." And I can remember them having, like, an argument because they shot her in the bed,
and then they had to go find another mattress. Well, that's when Trump came in,
00:49:07,196 --> 00:49:20,375 [ Sascha Riley]
so that's why I remember him so vividly. And it was at that point I had already decided, "They're
probably just gonna kill me anyway. I'm gonna take him with me." And I tried, but I did not.
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:29,516 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
How did, how did you... [sighs] So obviously, Trump was extremely violent. Trump's-
00:49:29,516 --> 00:49:29,846 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:49:29,846 --> 00:49:38,196 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
-a sadistic psychopath. When Trump assaulted you, so sexual assault and physical assault?
00:49:38,196 --> 00:49:39,276 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,776 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And-
00:49:40,776 --> 00:50:14,716 [ Sascha Riley]
So at one point, at that... Well, I kind of acquiesced to whatever sexual things that he wanted to
do, but at some point, uh, he wanted me to have sex with him. So he laid down on his stomach,
and there was a, uh, wooden tent stake that was in the room, and I had been eyeballing it as a
weapon. And what I did was put the condom on the wooden tent stake, put it inside of him,
00:50:14,776 --> 00:50:19,935 [ Sascha Riley]
and I kicked it as hard as I could, and that's why he had to get life-flighted out, because I ripped
him open.
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:27,256 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
[laughing] Oh, sweet. Do you ever watch the movie The Equalizer?
00:50:27,256 --> 00:50:28,516 [ Sascha Riley]
No, I haven't seen it.
00:50:28,516 --> 00:50:37,716 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]

-- 28 of 47 --

Denzel Washington, you know, sort of like justice when everyone in, involved in American law
enforcement can't
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:44,636 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
get any justice. Um, that would be a sort of situation, obviously. Um, I laughed-
00:50:44,636 --> 00:50:44,645 [ Sascha Riley]
Right.
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:48,886 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
-because there's poetic justice there, Sasha.
00:50:48,886 --> 00:50:50,176 [ Sascha Riley]
Well, that,
00:50:50,176 --> 00:51:04,036 [ Sascha Riley]
that, and that was what facilitated the... Not only did I get really assaulted by, uh, Andy Biggs, I
also got assaulted by, like, an entire party's worth of people. They took-
00:51:04,036 --> 00:51:07,556 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
After Trump was airlifted out?
00:51:07,556 --> 00:51:42,156 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah, at a whole 'nother party. So they took me to another party after that, and because I had
done that to one of those rich people, um, w- I, they took me from s- like station to station, and
they could do whatever they wanted. Most of them just beat, beat on me. I can remember me
standing there, had already gotten beaten up, you know, I don't know, five, six times, and I can
remember somebody urinated on me, and I said, "Thank you for not hurting me," and he just
hauled off and punched me in the side of the head and knocked me out. Um-
00:51:42,156 --> 00:51:42,395 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Hmm.
00:51:42,395 --> 00:51:49,556 [ Sascha Riley]
I can remember leaving that party, and my dad was just kind of dragging me out of there.
00:51:49,556 --> 00:52:06,106 [ Sascha Riley]
It was another instance, just like with Andy Biggs, where I got beaten to the point where, you
know, I was, I was... The room was spinning. I was nauseous, probably throwing up, um, maybe
some broken bones, uh, badly beaten over that.
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:14,234 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And how many perpetrators did you say again? 20 to 40, 25 to 40 perpetrators?
00:52:14,296 --> 00:52:31,236 [ Sascha Riley]
P- people that were there, yes. I would say probably eight or 10 that just beat the absolute hell
out of me, and some of them probably sexually assaulted me, but I can't remember. I can
remember getting, a, hurt, you know, just getting beaten up and, uh,
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:31,935 [ Sascha Riley]
you know.
00:52:31,935 --> 00:52:37,616 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]

-- 29 of 47 --

Was that before you tried to defend yourself from Trump or after? Do you remember?
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:38,526 [ Sascha Riley]
That was after.
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:38,536 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
After.
00:52:38,536 --> 00:52:58,956 [ Sascha Riley]
That was as a punishment, if you wanna call it that. The, what happened at that party was part
of the punishment, and then I can remember them saying that, "This is the last of it," when I
had to go see Andy Biggs, but Andy Biggs almost fucking killed me, so I remember him to this
day. I just-
00:52:58,956 --> 00:52:59,956 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So when Andy Biggs-
00:52:59,956 --> 00:52:59,986 [ Sascha Riley]
... It's hard to believe that he didn't kill me.
00:52:59,986 --> 00:53:03,996 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
-almost killed you was after Trump as well?
00:53:03,996 --> 00:53:04,516 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:04,895 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:35,456 [ Sascha Riley]
It w- uh, after. Andy Biggs was after Trump. The party that w- a whole bunch of people
assaulted me was after that, and then the last one was Andy Biggs, and then I can remember
my dad saying, "No more." Uh, I can remember him even kind of breaking down a little bit, like
psychologically, because of just, I guess, the repeated watching me just get destroyed by
people. You gotta understand, it's not like boo-boos and Band-Aids. They were breaking ribs
and, uh,
00:53:35,456 --> 00:53:39,776 [ Sascha Riley]
really hurting me. You know, I've got, like, a deformed ribcage to this day.
00:53:39,776 --> 00:53:40,906 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No, sounds like they were-
00:53:40,906 --> 00:53:41,026 [ Sascha Riley]
You know-
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:46,036 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
-trying to torture you just to the point of death to, to punish you-
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:46,286 [ Sascha Riley]
They, they tried-
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:47,316 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]

-- 30 of 47 --

-and to send a message.
00:53:47,316 --> 00:53:53,316 [ Sascha Riley]
They tried over and over again to hint to me to get me to kill myself.
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:53,435 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:53:53,435 --> 00:54:15,475 [ Sascha Riley]
And I can remember thinking, "There's no way I'm gonna kill myself, because that's what they
want." So just, [laughing] I survived some of that just out of spite, to be honest with you. Uh,
there's, there's really no other way to put it, but I wasn't going to... I just, I can remember
hating my mom so much that there w- I just did not want to give her the satisfaction.
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:17,236 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:54:17,236 --> 00:54:22,516 [ Sascha Riley]
She... As bad as my dad was, Mary Lynn Riley was even more evil.
00:54:22,516 --> 00:54:22,685 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Hmm.
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:27,576 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, she, sh- her thing was sexually torturing me.
00:54:27,576 --> 00:54:27,636 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Hmm.
00:54:27,636 --> 00:54:34,315 [ Sascha Riley]
So, and, and she enjoyed sexually torturing Samantha when they went and got her.
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:38,636 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And Samantha was the runaway that Ryder-
00:54:38,636 --> 00:55:19,305 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes, the runaway that she was-... a, a brothel, basically a, a, a house where they had, uh, four
or five underage girls that had, they had scooped up from wherever they got them from, and,
uh, they would use those girls at these parties. Well, at one time they sent me to go be a part of
that brothel, so that's when I made friends with Samantha, Patricia, and Sarah, and those are
the only three that I can remember their names. But Sarah, um, committed suicide, Samantha
was tortured to death, and Patricia was the girl that got shot in the bed before Trump came in.
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:21,805 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Did Patricia die?
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:22,584 [ Sascha Riley]
Oh, yeah.
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:22,725 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
00:55:22,725 --> 00:55:24,086 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 31 of 47 --

Yes.
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:29,486 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So Samantha, Patricia, and Sarah, and all three died?
00:55:29,486 --> 00:55:31,625 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes. Yes.
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:37,165 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So Samantha was the runaway that was murdered by your adoptive parents?
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:38,185 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:43,106 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Patricia committed suic- uh, Sarah committed suicide, and Patricia-
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:43,256 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:47,645 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... was murdered in the bed before Trump came in, and then they threatened-
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:48,606 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes, on-
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:49,125 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
- you-
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:49,316 [ Sascha Riley]
On the farm
00:55:49,316 --> 00:55:55,526 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... and said to let Trump do whatever Trump wanted to do to you, or they would shoot you in
the head as well?
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:56,446 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes. Yes.
00:55:56,446 --> 00:56:00,685 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
[sighs] Okay.
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:04,745 [ Sascha Riley]
And I can remember, I can remember them pointing a gun at me
00:56:04,805 --> 00:57:32,725 [ Sascha Riley]
and saying, "We're gonna kill you," and my dad protesting because he said, "If you shoot him,
we're all gonna go to jail." And he was, he was really-- I can remember him be- being
distraught. Now, he was... He's a kind of a tough guy and, you know, all of that sort of stuff, so
that's what stood out to me was he was really scared because he knew that if they just shot
me, that's not something he could explain to anybody, and he had gotten into so much trouble
with trying to get rid of me already. But, uh, there's the, the Chevy van incident, there's the
pool incident, and then there's the, uh, uh, stairs incident, and all of those generated a, a police

-- 32 of 47 --

report. In addition to that, we went down to Panama City, Florida, to the beach, either Panama
City or Destin, and they took me to a riptide area. Uh, I didn't know it was a riptide area. There
were no other people on the beach, you know, it was just us. But within, like, a hundred yards, a
hundred and fifty yards, there's the regular beach where people were at. Uh, you know how
they have the, the riptide zones, they don't want you out there, right? For obvious reasons.
Well, they took me to one of these zones and had me, you know, say, "Hey, you know, come
out here and play in the water," and this and that, and for the first few minutes, it was just the
three of us playing in the water, and I'm just a kid, you know? Beach is awesome. So, uh,
00:57:32,785 --> 00:58:50,805 [ Sascha Riley]
at any rate, they go back in, I'm out there playing, and eventually that, that current gets me,
and I don't know how to swim at this point in my life. So it pulls me out, you know, a hundred
feet maybe, and I'm bouncing up and down off the sandbar, just screaming my head off. Well,
somebody that was on the regular beach, not in the riptide area, heard the screaming and
came running from, like, a hundred and fifty yards away, and right by my parents who were
standing there, and he goes out there and gets me, fishes me out. By the time he comes back,
he's nearly exhausted, and I can remember him and my dad nearly fighting, and at this point,
there, there are other people that are coming, and, you know, that scares the shit out of my
dad. But there was another police report with that, and I know that that police report followed
us back up into Alabama because the sheriff came down there and talked to, uh, talked to my
dad in Alabama, so there was another investigation for sure. So all of those things had already
happened, and my dad was terrified that if something, uh, happened to me, at... especially so
close to all of these other things, that, that, all of these other investigations, he pretty much
knew he was gonna go to jail over it.
00:58:50,805 --> 00:58:51,986 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So there was at least-
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:52,086 [ Sascha Riley]
So-
00:58:52,086 --> 00:59:03,946 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... the, the, the Chevy van incident, pool incident, stairs incident, there was police inci- police
reports. How many police re- reports? About three or four? And then-
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:05,475 [ Sascha Riley]
That I can I, I, that, that-
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:05,475 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Four
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:46,446 [ Sascha Riley]
... that are just involved in trying to get rid of me, and then there were, in addition to those four,
there were two, two investigations, one for the porn, and then when we lived in the duplex and
they were torturing that girl to death, Samantha, um, our duplex neighbors there in Enterprise,
Alabama, they called the police because they could hear, uh, w- you know, screams and, and,
uh, you know, beatings and stuff like that. And when they investigated, I can remember my dad
saying, "Hey, you know, he..." Talking about me as just, uh, uh, you know, I had gotten in
trouble and got a whipping or something. And
00:59:46,446 --> 01:00:05,205 [ Sascha Riley]
they did an investigation. They, they like, uh, they collected blood samples and everything from
the house, but the problem was they couldn't determine how long that blood had been there, I

-- 33 of 47 --

guess. And they didn't-- It wasn't a match to anybody in the house. So
01:00:05,205 --> 01:00:23,506 [ Sascha Riley]
for whatever reason, they just didn't have enough, and I, uh, I don't think they were allowed to
talk to me. I think my dad would have had to have given them permission for the investigators
to interrogate me, so I don't recall ever giving testimony as a child.
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:23,546 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:29,386 [ Sascha Riley]
Not to the police p- in that instance or in the instance up in, uh, Tennessee.
01:00:29,446 --> 01:00:36,866 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Did you provide any testimony to the police in any of those five cases? Well, the one case with
the military-
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:36,875 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:39,526 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... with the child pornography, you, you-
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:45,086 [ Sascha Riley]
The, the, the, the, uh, I can remember the sheriff talking to me
01:00:45,086 --> 01:01:51,876 [ Sascha Riley]
at the, uh, at the beach in Panama City.... I don't remember what all was, was said, but I can
remember my dad tried to get out of there, and the guy that went and fished me out... My dad's
a pretty big guy, and he's- he can fight, but the guy that went and got me was like a, I mean, he
was a tank. So it wasn't something that he wanted to really get into a fight about over there,
and the, you know, people started coming in, so they, my parents, I can remember them trying
to hug me and stuff. Oh, my, my God, thank God. I can remember the guy that fished me out
and said, "There's no goddamn way. I heard that from 150 yards away, and you're standing
there watching him, and you didn't hear it," you know? And, you know, they tried to play it off
like, "Well, I- we just thought he was playing," you know, "swimming," and stuff like that. And I
can remember the sheriff asking, "Do you know how to swim?" And I said, "No, sir." And they
were like, "Okay, this, this fucking sucks." [laughing] You know, "There's no way that this is
legitimate." And I can remember the sheriff
01:01:51,936 --> 01:01:55,996 [ Sascha Riley]
in Alabama talking to my dad and saying,
01:01:55,996 --> 01:02:04,876 [ Sascha Riley]
"There better not be anything that happens to him," he said, "because I'm just gonna go ahead
and tell you, you're gonna go to jail. I don't care." [laughing] He said, "I'll make sure of it."
01:02:04,876 --> 01:02:05,486 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So they-
01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:05,486 [ Sascha Riley]
So I don't know about that-

-- 34 of 47 --

01:02:05,486 --> 01:02:10,416 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... they had a sense, but they didn't know. They didn't have enough of what they thought of as
evidence-
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:10,626 [ Sascha Riley]
They didn't have enough
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:11,595 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... to be able to do anything.
01:02:11,596 --> 01:02:12,476 [ Sascha Riley]
That's exactly right.
01:02:12,476 --> 01:02:13,136 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And that was the-
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:13,146 [ Sascha Riley]
Yep
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,016 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... case with Samantha as well?
01:02:16,016 --> 01:02:16,576 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes. It-
01:02:16,576 --> 01:02:17,336 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And, and-
01:02:17,336 --> 01:02:17,346 [ Sascha Riley]
See-
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:18,656 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... your dad wouldn't let them-
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:18,976 [ Sascha Riley]
This was unusual
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:21,016 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... talk to you?
01:02:21,016 --> 01:02:21,596 [ Sascha Riley]
What's that?
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:26,276 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And your dad wouldn't let the, the police officers talk to you, so-
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:26,996 [ Sascha Riley]
Right. A, anytime-
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:28,176 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
That also seems weird
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:30,556 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 35 of 47 --

... that he could block that, he, he did. Huh?
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:43,095 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
It seems weird. I, I mean, I know in Canada it's a bit different, like, in terms of, you know, there
would've been folks from Child Protection Services there, and they would've gotten you away
from-
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:43,436 [ Sascha Riley]
Right
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:51,096 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... your adoptive fathers to talk to, to talk to you. You wouldn't have gone through that sort of
horror in Canada. I'm-
01:02:51,096 --> 01:02:51,416 [ Sascha Riley]
Well-
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:53,116 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I'm really sad that that-
01:02:53,116 --> 01:02:53,126 [ Sascha Riley]
At one point
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:54,156 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... occurred.
01:02:54,156 --> 01:03:32,856 [ Sascha Riley]
At, at one point, CPS did take me. So I got into the foster care system, and the... Ultimately, uh,
I'm, I'm just gonna, uh... I, I was ungovernable, incorrigible, as, as, at, at that point in my life, if,
if you said something to me, um, you know, I didn't necessarily... I, I didn't care who you were. I
w- I wasn't necessarily gonna do that, and I might just hit you, you know, because that was just
my response to life at that point. So, uh, eventually I made my way right back to that house, so-
01:03:32,856 --> 01:03:33,336 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:49,096 [ Sascha Riley]
... uh, I can tell you that throughout the process of trying to work with me, Jane Goodall was one
of the people that worked with me, so I know that she is still alive. I think she's still alive. I think
she's 91 now.
01:03:49,096 --> 01:03:49,386 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:03:49,386 --> 01:04:08,456 [ Sascha Riley]
And she might recall having worked with me, because I w- I would've been one of the strangest
cases she ever had. Because at around that timeframe, I had made the decision that I would no
longer let anybody get within arm's reach of me, and if they did, I'd just, I'd fight for my life.
01:04:08,456 --> 01:04:08,576 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm.
01:04:08,576 --> 01:04:11,715 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 36 of 47 --

So, you know, people had to stay away from me.
01:04:11,716 --> 01:04:11,776 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So-
01:04:11,776 --> 01:04:14,036 [ Sascha Riley]
I could talk. I mean, I wasn't like a, a-
01:04:14,036 --> 01:04:14,196 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
01:04:14,196 --> 01:04:18,736 [ Sascha Riley]
... feral animal, but I just would not allow people
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:35,656 [ Sascha Riley]
within my personal space anymore. And because of her work, you know, with, with, uh, apes
and everything, with gorillas, you know, they, they kind of reached out to her to make contact
with me to see if they could help me.
01:04:35,656 --> 01:04:38,896 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:04:38,896 --> 01:04:46,876 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And did you talk to Jane Goodall at all about what you'd experienced getting trafficked? I know
when you and I spoke by email-
01:04:46,876 --> 01:04:46,965 [ Sascha Riley]
I did
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:59,496 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... Messenger, you said was from during about 1978 to 1986 is what you remembered, 9 to 13,
but you're not sure. It could have been as early as 6 or 7 years old.
01:04:59,496 --> 01:05:34,156 [ Sascha Riley]
Right. Right. I, I don't really start remembering what was going on till about 10 or 11, and, uh, I
just know that it happened before that. I can, I can remember being sexually assaulted by
family. Uh, that's some of my very first memories. So, um, but as far as taking me to other
places, at these parties and, and whatnot, I, I, I know that that sort of thing was happening, but
I just don't have a good enough recollection to really piece together much of a story.
01:05:34,156 --> 01:05:40,776 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
So whether you were 6 or 7 years old or, or 10 or 11 years old, with the parties, when you-
01:05:40,776 --> 01:05:40,916 [ Sascha Riley]
Right
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:41,496 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... they came.
01:05:41,496 --> 01:05:42,036 [ Sascha Riley]
Right.
01:05:42,036 --> 01:05:42,396 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]

-- 37 of 47 --

Okay.
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:49,286 [ Sascha Riley]
I know family was assaulting me, and then friends of family were assaulting me as early as 6 or
7. I, I know that.
01:05:49,286 --> 01:05:49,296 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:05:49,296 --> 01:06:16,776 [ Sascha Riley]
Some of my very first memories are of being assaulted. Um, but as far as taking me to places,
uh, uh, to make money at these parties, I don't have a clear recollection. It may have happened
as early as the, the first sexual assaults that were happening with family. Um, but I don't have a
clear recollection if that was going on to that scale at that time, but do have a recollection from
about 10 or 11.
01:06:16,776 --> 01:06:24,456 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay. So
01:06:24,456 --> 01:06:25,276 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
how much-
01:06:25,276 --> 01:06:26,256 [ Sascha Riley]
I know it's-
01:06:26,256 --> 01:06:42,856 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No, no, it's, it's okay. I'm, I'm, I, I'm glad you're, you're... You and I are b- able to have such a
thorough discussion, and, and I appreciate, again, how straightforward and forthright you are.
You know, it's, it's extremely important. Um-
01:06:42,856 --> 01:07:04,676 [ Sascha Riley]
I mean, there's a part of me that just wants to point fingers in every direction, but I have, I have
really thought about, "Okay, what do I recall m- vividly enough that-"... put my hand on a Bible
in a courtroom, raise my hand, and say, "Yep, that's the truth," and, and what I am
01:07:04,676 --> 01:07:11,496 [ Sascha Riley]
as close to 100% certain that if you put me on a polygraph, it would come back just as perfect.
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:11,896 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:07:11,896 --> 01:07:21,576 [ Sascha Riley]
So there are other things that I could maybe point fingers at, but then it kind of gets into
muddying the water because I don't really remember them that well.
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:22,706 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Well, I think what-
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:23,856 [ Sascha Riley]
So that's why I've just stopped.
01:07:23,856 --> 01:07:36,756 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. No, that's, that's good, and I think what, what I'd like to do, like, we'll continue talk- you

-- 38 of 47 --

know, discussing a bit about what we're talking about now. Um, the things that you're less
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:58,816 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
sure of, I'd like to look at a, a, a second, at a, a dis- a conversation just entirely focused on what
you're not sure of, just because I think there is some important information there, but I don't
want to muddy the waters in terms of what we're speaking about now that you, you, that you
are willing to testify in a court of law about. So, so let's fo-
01:07:58,816 --> 01:07:59,056 [ Sascha Riley]
Right
01:07:59,056 --> 01:08:04,555 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... continue focusing about any of the details about what you're willing to swear to in a court of
law.
01:08:04,556 --> 01:08:05,536 [ Sascha Riley]
Right.
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:06,496 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
And then-
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:07,016 [ Sascha Riley]
Right
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:32,015 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... you know, then let's look at, I would maybe look at, say, a second discussion and any, any
follow-on questions from this discussion, or I might just look at getting everything transcribed,
and I'm just gonna look at it raw, 'cause honestly, in terms of, um, you know, all the... There's
obviously th- thousands and thousands of, of
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:36,736 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
pieces of video footage, film that the FBI took that's all gone into some-
01:08:39,356 --> 01:08:39,596 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
01:08:39,596 --> 01:08:40,696 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... whoever's been-
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:41,076 [ Sascha Riley]
And, and, uh
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:57,055 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... trying to profit off of this nonsense. So my, what I'm looking at, I'm thinking even a, a
combination, like just a brief summary from me, like a paragraph, and I'll even look at, at just
publishing the raw audio file of our discussion-
01:08:57,056 --> 01:08:57,496 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay
01:08:57,496 --> 01:08:59,076 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... with the text messages.

-- 39 of 47 --

01:08:59,076 --> 01:08:59,086 [ Sascha Riley]
Absolutely.
01:08:59,086 --> 01:09:17,536 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
'Cause I think the context is really important, I think, especially 'cause there's been so much
collusion regarding copy editing of video footage that, you know, folks that are really wanting,
that are genuinely wanting justice, you know, for them to just-
01:09:17,536 --> 01:09:17,565 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
01:09:17,565 --> 01:09:23,956 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... hear the audio recordings and read the text messages is plain as day. Anybody that
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:33,196 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
experiences an ounce of integrity will be able to discern the truth, and I think it's so important.
01:09:33,196 --> 01:09:40,315 [ Sascha Riley]
And I, I kinda wanted to discuss one other thing, too. One kind of theme at these parties
01:09:40,316 --> 01:09:42,376 [ Sascha Riley]
that,
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:46,556 [ Sascha Riley]
that seemed to be very, uh,
01:09:46,556 --> 01:09:49,475 [ Sascha Riley]
very well thought out is
01:09:49,536 --> 01:10:05,436 [ Sascha Riley]
they would have a larger party in the beginning, right? And, and in these larger parties, you
might have, say, uh, a couple of fights or some drug use or, uh, you know, things that, that,
that, that, that were
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:21,296 [ Sascha Riley]
kind of, we'll say, mildly illegal. But the parties would go on for multiple days, and as the, uh,
thing wound down to the smaller inner circle in the last day or last two days or whatever, that's
when the really horrible shit happened.
01:10:21,296 --> 01:10:21,836 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm.
01:10:21,836 --> 01:11:14,295 [ Sascha Riley]
So some of the people that attended the party, possibly even people like Clarence Thomas or
Lindsey Graham, may have been involved in lesser things, uh, but then were also at the, uh,
same time and place where these more horrible things happened, but they didn't necessarily
participate in those more horrible things. So that seemed to be an underlying theme of, of, and,
and this is just me speculating here as an adult, where they would try to get these affluent
people in all of these positions of, of power and influence to come participate in these parties
where all of these things were going on, so that, you know, uh, if Clarence Thomas, I'll just use
him, if he was there at the party, well, then surely nothing, you know, that nefarious could be
going on type of situations.

-- 40 of 47 --

01:11:14,296 --> 01:11:14,616 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:11:14,616 --> 01:11:40,436 [ Sascha Riley]
So it seemed to be very well thought out how they kind of did things, but as the party wound
down, that's when, uh, people in my position would, would really begin to get scared because
that's when either you're gonna get assaulted and maybe really busted up or, you know... I
mean, even watching somebody die is, is, uh, r- really fucking horrible, you know? Uh, and-
01:11:40,436 --> 01:11:48,896 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Did, did, did you see anyone else die besides, um, Samantha and, and Patricia?
01:11:48,896 --> 01:11:49,616 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes.
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:50,516 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yes.
01:11:50,516 --> 01:12:15,376 [ Sascha Riley]
So, uh, I watched, uh, I watched a grown man get beaten to death. He had done something, uh,
that pissed off the people that were running it, and they killed him. I saw another girl, uh, the,
in addition to Patricia, when I was making the film, with the girl, they came in and shot her
while we were having sex. That was some sort of snuff film.
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:15,896 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:33,156 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, and then in the brothel, there were two people that got killed. Uh, Sarah killed herself, and
then, uh, a girl, I don't remember her name, she was, she was shot and killed, and then another
girl was also shot and killed.
01:12:33,156 --> 01:12:34,806 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay, and all of these-
01:12:34,806 --> 01:12:35,776 [ Sascha Riley]
And I can remember-
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:36,456 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No, go ahead.
01:12:36,456 --> 01:13:17,084 [ Sascha Riley]
Me and Samantha having to clean up. Uh, we didn't have to do anything with the body, but I
can remember me and Samantha had to clean up the blood and everything from, from both
Sarah s- Sarah's suicide, which was an assisted suicide. Samantha actually shot Sarah, um, but
Sarah wanted her to do it. She just couldn't pull the trigger herself. So that's just-... Samantha
did it. I was in the room when she did it. But it wasn't, it wasn't a murder. Samantha didn't
murder her. S- Sarah just, I can remember her just saying, "I just, I can't go to another party. I
can't be here. Please." You know?
01:13:17,084 --> 01:13:30,943 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
W- another of the victims, I don't know if you've read about, uh, the British woman, Sarah
Ransome, was on the Epstein Island and, and tried to swim off the island and was willing to

-- 41 of 47 --

drown than, than go through another-
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:32,474 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:32,884 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... torture party.
01:13:32,884 --> 01:13:36,103 [ Sascha Riley]
I mean, it's, it's some horrible, horrible shit.
01:13:36,103 --> 01:13:36,443 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:13:36,443 --> 01:13:46,464 [ Sascha Riley]
And, you know, it's, it... I can remember the, the hillbillies that my dad sold me to when I was
small, they were mean.
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:50,344 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, but I can remember the meanest
01:13:50,344 --> 01:13:56,464 [ Sascha Riley]
motherfuckers are those rich people. They are just demonic, Trump included.
01:13:56,464 --> 01:14:10,924 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. Well, [sighs] I'm gonna ask you some questions there again. So with the, the, the rich
folks that you were sold to, that was all associated with, with the Epstein-Trump trafficking ring,
and you said to me you thought-
01:14:11,004 --> 01:14:11,103 [ Sascha Riley]
Yes
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:15,603 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... Trump ran things with Epstein. Is that true?
01:14:15,603 --> 01:14:21,184 [ Sascha Riley]
Oh, yes. He was not just a, a client. He was one of the, the
01:14:21,184 --> 01:14:41,684 [ Sascha Riley]
people that facilitated all that stuff. It, it was almost like, uh, eh, and this is just my childhood
brain piecing it together, it was almost as if Epstein worked for Trump, and not just Trump, but
him and maybe six or eight other super rich guys. So-
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:42,443 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Do you remember any-
01:14:42,443 --> 01:14:43,464 [ Sascha Riley]
Epstein ran it-
01:14:43,464 --> 01:14:44,044 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
01:14:44,044 --> 01:15:11,184 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 42 of 47 --

... at the behest of Trump and, and that circle of people. So it wa- it was just a... I, I couldn't tell
you how many people, but he was the only one that, that, that I remember that was at that
level. But it wasn't that Trump was a john visiting, you know, Epstein's empire of, of, uh, you
know, uh, child
01:15:11,184 --> 01:15:20,443 [ Sascha Riley]
victims. It was, Trump was in a, a position above Epstein. It was as if Epstein worked for Trump-
01:15:20,443 --> 01:15:21,483 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:26,704 [ Sascha Riley]
... and the rest of those ultra-rich guys.
01:15:26,704 --> 01:15:27,464 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Do you remember-
01:15:27,464 --> 01:15:29,324 [ Sascha Riley]
Like, he ran that ring for them.
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:29,804 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:15:29,804 --> 01:15:29,864 [ Sascha Riley]
In a way.
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:39,404 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
No, no, I understand. I... So, so Re- s- so Jeffrey was sort of presented publicly
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:42,384 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
as the ringleader of the pedophile-
01:15:42,384 --> 01:15:42,393 [ Sascha Riley]
Mm
01:15:42,393 --> 01:15:48,824 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... ring, but Jeffrey was basically behaving like a, like a general manager of the ring, and then
there was-
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:48,834 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:59,184 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... seven or eight other individuals, such as Trump, that were actually actively running the ring,
micromanaging, telling Jeffrey what to do.
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:03,084 [ Sascha Riley]
They... He, he would give
01:16:03,084 --> 01:16:16,044 [ Sascha Riley]
Epstein, that caliber of person, because I... It wasn't just Epstein. Epstein had people that
worked with him, too, on a, on a lower level that would go, like, find runaways and stuff like
that.

01:16:16,044 --> 01:16:17,004 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:16:17,004 --> 01:16:29,764 [ Sascha Riley]
So I don't, I don't know where they got the people. I can't, I can't say that, but, you know, it
was, it was this, this whole thing was being run as a, yeah, a- as for those rich people.
01:16:29,764 --> 01:16:41,023 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah. I, I wanna ask you some more questions in terms of your sense of, like, the demonic. Um,
01:16:41,023 --> 01:16:49,184 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
some of, some of the, the advisory work I've done, some of my
01:16:49,184 --> 01:17:24,464 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
own specifics of law enforcement, um, you know, I've come into contact, I've minimized any
contact with, I'm familiar with a lot of really horrific horror stories that involve, um, Satanists,
occult practitioners, theistic Satanists. You know, I've, I've spoken to folks that, um, were able
to get out of the theistic Satanist cults. A lot of the torture techniques you describe are similar
to theistic Satanist torture techniques, um, sexual torture-
01:17:24,464 --> 01:17:24,474 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
01:17:24,474 --> 01:17:26,063 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... human trafficking-
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:26,074 [ Sascha Riley]
I can, I can-
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:42,544 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... human cannibalism, and what I wanna I, I... You know, what, what's your sense in terms of
these parties that, that... What do you remember? Like, was there any overt... I know a lot of
the attendees presented themselves as Christians-
01:17:42,544 --> 01:17:42,574 [ Sascha Riley]
Yeah
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:47,244 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
... but their practices are, are full-blown demonic Satanic.
01:17:47,244 --> 01:18:00,804 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Do you have the sense that any of them were actually secretly practicing any sort of occult
rituals, or were they just, like, rich, fiendish, fake Christians that just didn't experience a
conscience?
01:18:00,804 --> 01:18:08,704 [ Sascha Riley]
I think it's the latter, just rich, fake Christians. I can, I can tell you, uh, one thing specifically that
Trump did-
01:18:08,704 --> 01:18:08,824 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
01:18:08,824 --> 01:18:33,204 [ Sascha Riley]

-- 44 of 47 --

... and, uh, that, that I remember vividly. He, uh... I was exhausted, and I couldn't fight back,
and he sat on my chest and would choke me until I was unconscious, and each time that he did
it, he'd say, "I'm gonna kill you." So, and then he would choke me until I was out, and, you
know,
01:18:33,204 --> 01:18:48,864 [ Sascha Riley]
he did that, you know, half a dozen times or however many times, and I can remember him
saying, "I thought I killed you that time. I'm really gonna do it this time," and then choke me
again. So he would just do that over and over again until he got bored of it.
01:18:48,864 --> 01:18:49,343 [ Sascha Riley]
So that, that type of thing-
01:18:49,344 --> 01:18:54,884 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Did you get the sense that he was trying to kill you or just to torture you about the
01:18:54,884 --> 01:18:55,674 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
thought of killing you?
01:18:55,674 --> 01:18:59,744 [ Sascha Riley]
Well, in, in the moment, in the moment you think you're gonna die.
01:18:59,744 --> 01:18:59,943 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:09,540 [ Sascha Riley]
And that, that's the experience that, that-... he wants to see the fear in another human being's
eyes that thinks that, that, that he's killing him, you know?
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:09,740 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:29,700 [ Sascha Riley]
Um, but looking back, I just think he was just torturing me, you know? I don't think, I think if,
had he wanted to kill me, he could have. You know, he could have just kept choking me until I
was, I was gone. 'Cause I did, I, I did get choked until I was unconscious, I don't know, as many
as half a dozen times, maybe more.
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,200 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,680 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, uh,
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:36,300 [ Sascha Riley]
so that's the type of thing that he would do or worse.
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:36,310 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:55,460 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, um, I believe, I wouldn't swear to this, but I believe that on that instance, y- they had
told, my dad had told him, "Hey, you can't bust him up. You can't break stuff," um, you know,

-- 45 of 47 --

because all his ch- CPS bullshit.
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,200 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:04,590 [ Sascha Riley]
So, and, and I, I wanna say, I wanna say he was upset at the end of that, too, because of the
bruising. You know-
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:04,590 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Right
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:08,860 [ Sascha Riley]
... they didn't break bones or anything. Uh,
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:27,900 [ Sascha Riley]
but, you know, obviously I had bruising around my neck and different bruises on my body, and,
and, uh, uh... That's something else, too, that, that I'm just remembering right now as I'm
talking to you. At least one instance, the school nurse, uh, got CPS involved, I believe-
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,900 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:35,400 [ Sascha Riley]
... in both Tennessee and Alabama because of the bruises that I showed up to school with.
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:35,960 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Yeah.
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:43,240 [ Sascha Riley]
You know, and of course, my parents just said, "Hey, he's clumsy," you know, "He fell out of a
tree house," or whatever excuse they gave-
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:43,370 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Mm-hmm
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:46,320 [ Sascha Riley]
... you know. Um, but
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:52,940 [ Sascha Riley]
there was, it was looked into, but obviously nothing, nothing materialized from it.
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:57,880 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay. So
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,480 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
let me see. Can I call you back in about 10 minutes?
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:02,920 [ Sascha Riley]
Sure.
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,570 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Okay.

-- 46 of 47 --

01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:03,620 [ Sascha Riley]
Absolutely.
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:15,480 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
I just, I just wanna make sure I've got the recording set, you know, that I w- I wanna get into a
file folder and get some duplicates, and then I'll call you back, okay?
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,539 [ Sascha Riley]
Okay, sounds good.
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:26,780 [Lisa Noelle Voldeng]
Talk to you in a minute. Bye-bye.
