Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page13 of 49 


The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press is an unincorporated 
nonprofit association. The Reporters Committee was founded by leading 
journalists and media lawyers in 1970 when the nation’s news media faced an 
unprecedented wave of government subpoenas forcing reporters to name 
confidential sources. Today, its attorneys provide pro bono legal representation, 
amicus curiae support, and other legal resources to protect First Amendment 
freedoms and the newsgathering rights of journalists. 

As representatives and members of the news media, amici have a strong 
interest in protecting the public’s First Amendment and common law rights of 
access to court documents. Members of the press regularly rely upon court 
documents to keep the public apprised of cases within the public interest, as well as 
to facilitate public monitoring of the judicial system. When courts fail to 
adequately consider the costs to the public interest in sealing court records, the 
ability of journalists to gather facts and keep the public apprised of actions of the 
judicial branch is threatened. Amici write in support of the Intervenors-Appellants 
Julie Brown and the Miami Herald (collectively, the “Miami Herald”) because the 


district court’s decision in this case seals court records in an overly broad manner, 


members, or their counsel—contributed money that was intended to fund preparing 
or submitting this brief.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 

“People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, 
but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.” 
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 573 (1980) (plurality 
opinion). For this reason, the public’s First Amendment and common law rights of 
access to judicial proceedings and records play a critical, fundamental part in 
ensuring public confidence in the judicial system. United States v. Amodeo, 71 
F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Amodeo IT’). And public access, which is 
necessary to both the fairness of the judicial system and the public’s perception of 
its fairness, cannot be curtailed except where necessitated by compelling interests. 

Where the First Amendment right of access applies, judicial documents may 
only be sealed if—and only to the extent that—an “overriding interest” overcomes 
the public’s strong, presumptive right of access. N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y. 
City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 304 (2d Cir. 2012). Under the common law, 
judicial documents may only be sealed if “countervailing factors” outweigh the 


public’s interest in access. Amodeo IT, 71 F.3d at 1050. 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page16 of 49 


The Miami Herald seeks access to all of the documents filed under seal in 
this case, which include (1) discovery motions and their exhibits;? (2) the entire 
body of the Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and more than half of the 
order denying Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (the “Summary 
Judgment Documents”) and (3) parts of a motion to intervene and unseal filed by 
Alan Dershowitz and the order denying that motion. See Giuffre v Maxwell, Mem. 
of Law in Support of Proposed Intervenors Julie Brown and Miami Herald Media 
Company’s Mot. to Intervene and Unseal (filed Apr. 6, 2018), ECF No. 936 at 4-6. 

The district court denied the Miami Herald’s motion to unseal, concluding 
that what it deemed the “Discovery Documents” were not subject to the common 
law or First Amendment presumptions of access; it held that those presumptions of 
access were applicable but overcome with respect to the Summary Judgment 


Documents.? Sp.A.-27—28, 33-41. In denying the Miami Herald’s motion to 


? Because the district court allowed the parties to file many documents under 
seal without first filing a motion to seal, see A.-265, it is difficult to determine the 
nature of all of the sealed documents in this case. In its brief, the Miami Herald 
has listed the sealed discovery documents that were identified in the record. See 
Br. and Special App. for Intervenors-Appellants at 14. 

> The district court’s opinion divides the documents the Miami Herald seeks 
to unseal into two categories: “Discovery Documents” and “Summary Judgment 
Judicial Documents.” Sp.A.-27—29. It did not address the partial sealing of Mr. 
Dershowitz’s motion to intervene and the order denying that motion. See id. 

Despite the district court’s designation of the first category of documents as 
“Discovery Documents,” amici agree with the Miami Herald that these documents 

5 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page17 of 49 


unseal the Summary Judgment Documents, the district court severely undervalued 
the powerful public interest in this case and vastly overstated the asserted 
countervailing interests in favor of secrecy. Contrary to the district court’s concern 
that public access to the Summary Judgment Documents will serve only to 
“promote scandal,” access will provide the public and the press with information 
key to their understanding of this litigation, which relates to allegations of serial 
sexual assault and abuse of minors by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and 
has implicated high-level public officials and public figures. The district court 
made only broad, general references to the protection of private information, 
including information about minor sexual abuse victims, to conclude that privacy 


interests in this case weighed heavily against the public’s right of access. 


are not merely unfiled discovery exchanged between the parties, but rather are 
documents that were filed in connection with discovery motions. See Br. and 
Special App. for Intervenors-Appellants at 18-19. Amici also agree with the 
Miami Herald that the district court erred in concluding that the Discovery 
Documents are not judicial records subject to the First Amendment and common 
law rights of access. See id. at 13-17. Because that issue has been fully addressed 
in the Miami Herald’s opening brief, id., and the previous amici brief filed by 
many of the same amici who join this brief, see Br. of Amici Curiae the Reporters 
Comm. for Freedom of the Press and 18 Media Organizations in Support of 
Intervenors Appellants, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 16-3945(L) at 10-14 (filed Sept. 
20, 2017), ECF No. 106, amici do not address that issue in this brief. In addition, 
amici agree with the Miami Herald that the district court must engage in a 
document-by-document analysis of the Discovery Documents to ensure that any 
sealing is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored. See Br. and 
Special App. for Intervenors-Appellants at 26-27. 

6 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page18 of 49 


In addition, the district court’s ruling essentially delegated its authority to 
seal the Summary Judgment Documents to the parties’ judgment. Rather than 
conducting an independent review of the Summary Judgment Documents to 
determine whether or not compelling interests continue to justify sealing, the 
district court simply relied on the parties’ initial designation of portions of the 
Summary Judgment Documents as “confidential” to justify their continued sealing. 
And the district court completely failed to address the Miami Herald’s motion to 
unseal Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to intervene and the order denying that motion. 

For the reasons set forth herein and in the Miami Herald’s brief, amici 
respectfully urge this Court to reverse the district court’s order. 

ARGUMENT 
I. Public access is an essential feature of our judicial system. 

Openness of judicial proceedings “has long been recognized as an 
indispensable attribute” of the American justice system. Richmond Newspapers, 
Inc., 448 U.S. at 569. “The notion that the public should have access to the 
proceedings and documents of courts is integral to our system of government.” 
United States v. Erie Cty., 763 F.3d 235, 238—39 (2d Cir. 2014). 

Access to judicial proceedings and documents “permits the public to 
participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial process—an essential 


component in our structure of self-government.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. 
q 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page19 of 49 


Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 606 (1982). Indeed, as this Court has emphasized, 
the presumption of access to judicial records arises from “the need for federal 
courts, although independent—indeed, particularly because they are independent— 
to have a measure of accountability and for the public to have confidence in the 
administration of justice.” Amodeo IT, 71 F.3d at 1048. 

Public access to judicial proceedings and records allows the public to 
observe and monitor the workings of the federal judiciary. Jd. It “provides judges 
with critical views of their work,” “deters arbitrary judicial behavior,” and 
promotes “confidence in the conscientiousness, reasonableness, [and] honesty of 
judicial proceedings.” Jd. In order to effectively monitor the courts, the public 
requires information—information that is often found in judicial documents and 
brought to light by the press. See id. (“Such monitoring is not possible without 
access to testimony and documents that are used in the performance of Article III 
functions”). Thus, public access to judicial documents “enhances both the basic 
fairness of” the judicial system “and the appearance of fairness so essential to 
public confidence in the system.” Press-Enter. Co. v Superior Court, 464 U.S. 


501, 508 (1984) (“Press-Enterprise I’).

II. The district court erred in dismissing the significant public interest in 
access to the Summary Judgment Documents. 


A. — Access will allow the public to evaluate the judicial system’s handling 
of litigation related to sexual abuse and assault of minors, an issue of 


paramount public concern. 


In denying the Miami Herald’s motion to unseal, the district court closed its 
eyes to the particularly strong public interest in access to the Summary Judgment 
Documents. See Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 814 
F.3d 132, 143 (2d Cir. 2016) (finding that strong public interest in the subject of a 
case weighs against sealing documents related to the matter). Rather, the district 
court concluded that the Miami Herald had not identified a particular need for the 
Summary Judgment Documents and that unsealing would simply “promote 
scandal.” Sp.A.-40. To the contrary, sexual assault and trafficking of minors, 
including the judicial system’s handling of these issues, are squarely matters of 
public concern. Educating readers about these threats is not promoting scandal but 
providing knowledge that will enable the public to be better informed about risks 
in their own communities. 

With the emergence of the “#MeToo Movement,” public awareness of issues 
of sexual assault, abuse, and trafficking has only risen in recent years. Public 
attention to these issues has become so great that in 2017, Time magazine named 


“the silence breakers”— individuals who have spoken out after being victims of 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page21 of 49 


sexual assault—its “Person of the Year.” Stephanie Zacharek et al., Person of the 
Year 2017: The Silence Breakers, TIME, https://perma.cc/JSCU-69KC (last visited 
Dec. 7, 2018). Many news outlets have brought to light allegations of sexual 
harassment and abuse in Hollywood, politics, the media, and other industries. See, 
e.g., Jodi Kantor & Megan Twohey, Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual 
Harassment Accusers for Decades, N.Y. Times (Oct. 5, 2017),

Misconduct by Las Vegas Mogul Steve Wynn, Wall Street J. (Jan. 27, 2018), 
https://perma.cc/DK92-YJBW. 

The public has a legitimate interest in examining how courts handle both 


criminal and civil cases related to sexual assault. For example, when college 
10 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page22 of 49 


student Brock Turner was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman 
and sentenced to only a few months in jail, news reports and the resulting public 
outcry led to calls to alter sentencing guidelines for sex-based crimes. See Travis 
M. Andrews, Ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner leaves jail Friday but 
controversy still rages, Wash. Post (Aug. 30, 2016), https://perma.cc/7 V9J-VBEW. 
News reports used court records to examine the evidence against Turner, allowing 
the public to better understand—and criticize—how the criminal justice system 
handled his case. See, e.g., Susan Svrluga, ‘Did you rage?’ In Stanford sexual 
assault case, court records shed new light, Wash. Post (June 10, 2016), 
https://perma.cc/C8F4-FKJA; Ray Sanchez, Stanford rape case: Inside the court 
documents, CNN (June 11, 2016), https://perma.cc/389Z-EU35; Hannah Knowles, 
Documents from Court, District Attorney reveal details in Brock Turner case, 
Stanford Daily (June 10, 2016), https://perma.cc/3C7R-57CW. 

Similarly, when comedian Bill Cosby was tried and convicted of three 
counts of aggravated indecent assault, the news media used court records to report 
arguments presented in the case, as well as how the judge ruled on various 
motions. Eric Levenson, Bill Cosby’s maximum sentence now 10 years after 
charges merged, CNN (Sept. 24, 2018), https://perma.cc/A7JY-J9Q6; see also Eric 
Levenson, Bill Cosby sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison for sexual assault, CNN 


(Sept. 26, 2018), https://perma.cc/WQ82-7SBZ. Some advocates for reform of 
11 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page23 of 49 


sexual violence laws lauded Cosby’s sentencing as one that inspired confidence in 
the judicial system. Id. 

In short, the press regularly uses court records to report on cases related to 
allegations of sexual assault, and such reporting allows “the public to participate in 
and serve as a check upon the judicial process.” Globe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. 
at 606. 


B. This case, in particular, relates to a matter that has been the subject of 
widespread reporting and is certainly a matter of public concern. 


Not only does the public have a legitimate interest in the general subject 
matter of this dispute, see Section II.A., supra, the interest in this case and in its 
related judicial records is particularly acute due to the variety of public figures and 
public officials who are alleged to be connected to Jeffrey Epstein and his victims, 
such as President Donald Trump, former-President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, 
Duke of York, and Alan Dershowitz. See, e.g., Jan Musgrave, Will President 
Trump be used as witness in sex offender Epstein’s case?, Palm Beach Post (May 
12, 2017), https://perma.cc/GPA7-QRLR;; Josh Gerstein, The one weird court case

https://perma.cc/HYW5-D2MM (letter to the editor by Dershowitz in which he

Here, the Miami Herald seeks access to court records so that it may continue 
its groundbreaking investigative reporting on the handling of Epstein’s criminal 
prosecution, as well as related civil litigation. See Br. and Special App. for 
Intervenors-Appellants at 4-5. Epstein’s plea deal, under which he pled guilty to 
state criminal charges and agreed to serve a 13-month sentence, continues to make 
headlines. David Von Drehle, Jeffrey Epstein’s plea deal is a travesty. But we can 
still find justice, Washington Post (Dec. 11, 2018), https://perma.cc/RZR2-JCWE; 
Conchita Sarnoff, Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire Pedophile, Goes Free, Daily Beast 
(July 20, 2010), https://perma.cc/HMC3-HQJG. Recently, a group of legislators 
called for a Department of Justice probe into now-U.S. Secretary of Labor 
Alexander Acosta’s involvement in the deal, in his prior capacity as the U.S. 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. See Julie K. Brown et al, Lawmakers

Miami Herald (Nov. 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/GA2C-UW97. Other litigation 
related to Epstein and his victims has been the subject of recent news reports as 
well. See Julie K. Brown & Caitlin Ostroff, Epstein sex abuse victims press judge 
for decision on tossing his lenient plea deal, Miami Herald, (Dec. 10, 2018),

Avoiding Testimony From Accusers in Sex Case, N.Y. Times (Dec. 4, 2018), 
https://nyti.ms/2zKIGro. 

These matters have received extensive coverage in the news media because 
they are of significant and legitimate interest to the public. Reporting related to the 
allegations against Epstein—which are central to this case—is not to “promote 
scandal” or misuse judicial records “to gratify private spite,” as the district court 
stated. Sp.A.-40. Nor is it an attempt to disseminate “reservoirs of libelous 
statements.” Jd. Rather, coverage of this case builds public understanding of a 
major news story that implicates national conversations related to sexual assault, 
the actions of public officials and public figures, and the role of the courts in 
litigating these disputes. Access to the Summary Judgment Documents will further 
public monitoring of the judicial system in a case that is of paramount public 


interest.

Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page26 of 49 


C. | Astrong presumption of access applies to a motion for summary 
judgment and documents filed in connection thereto, even when that 
motion is denied. 

Amici agree with the Miami Herald that, in addition to giving short-shrift to 
the powerful public interest in this case, the district court erroneously concluded 
that under the common law the presumption of access to the Summary Judgment 
Documents “is less” because the “‘district court denied the summary judgment 
motion.’” Sp.A.-34 (quoting Amodeo IT, 71 F.3d at 1049); see Br. and Special 
App. for Intervenors-Appellants at 20-21. 

In support of that conclusion, the district court quoted Amodeo IT, which 
itself cited, in dicta, a partial concurrence and partial dissent from the D.C. 
Circuit’s decision in In re Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 773 F.2d 
1325, 1342, n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Jd. (quoting Amodeo IT, 71 F.3d at 1049). 
However, in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, this Court expressly rejected 
reliance on that dicta as “neither central to our holding nor a point of thorough 
analysis” in Amodeo II. 435 F.3d 110, 121 (2d Cir. 2006). Moreover, this Court in 
Lugosch also clarified that the presumption of access to motions for summary 
judgment and related documents “is of the highest [order]: ‘documents used by 
parties moving for, or opposing, summary judgment should not remain under seal 
absent the most compelling reasons.’” Jd. at 123 (quoting Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 


880, 893 (2d Cir. 1982)). Thus, the district court erred in attaching little weight to 
15 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page27 of 49 


the common law presumption of access to the Summary Judgment Documents 
because of the district court’s denial of the motion. The public has just as great an 
interest in understanding why a court has denied a motion for summary judgment 
as it would in understanding why a court has granted such a motion. 

The public also has a particularly strong interest in access to the entirety of 
the district court’s opinion granting or denying a motion for summary judgment 
under both the First Amendment and the common law. See Co. Doe v. Pub. 
Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 267 (4th Cir. 2014) (“The public has an interest in learning 
not only the evidence and records filed in connection with summary judgment 
proceedings but also the district court’s decision ruling on a summary judgment 
motion and the grounds supporting its decision. Without access to judicial 
opinions, public oversight of the courts, including the processes and the outcomes 
they produce, would be impossible.”). As this Court has observed, “Transparency 
is pivotal to public perception of the judiciary’s legitimacy and independence. . . . 
Because the Constitution grants the judiciary ‘neither force nor will, but merely 
judgment,’ The Federalist No. 78 (Alexander Hamilton), courts must impede 
scrutiny of the exercise of that judgment only in the rarest of circumstances.” 
United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 83 (2d Cir. 2008). Thus, “[1] n the top drawer 
of judicial records are documents authored or generated by the court itself in 


discharging its public duties, including opinions, orders, judgments, docket sheets, 
16 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page28 of 49 


and other information related to the court’s public functions” and “this drawer is 
hardly ever closed to the public.” Jn re Sealing & Non-Disclosure of 
Pen/Trap/2703(d) Orders, 562 F. Supp. 2d 876, 891 (S.D. Tex. 2008). As the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has explained: 


What happens in the federal courts is presumptively open 
to public scrutiny. Judges deliberate in private but issue 
public decisions after public arguments based on public 
records. The political branches of government claim 
legitimacy by election, judges by reason. Any step that 
withdraws an element of the judicial process from public 
view makes the ensuing decision look more like fiat and 
requires rigorous justification. The Supreme Court issues 
public opinions in all cases, even those said to involve 
state secrets. See New York Times Co. v. United States, 
403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971). A 
district court issued public opinions in a case dealing 
with construction plans for hydrogen bombs. United 
States v. Progressive, Inc., 467 F.Supp. 990, rehearing 
denied, 486 F.Supp. 5 (W.D.Wis.), appeal dismissed, 610 
F.2d 819 (7th Cir.1979). ... 


Hicklin Eng’g, L.C. v. Bartell, 439 F.3d 346, 348—49 (7th Cir. 2006), abrogated on 
other grounds by RTP LLC v. ORIX Real Estate Capital, Inc., 827 F.3d 689, 692 
(7th Cir. 2016). In other words, public access to judicial decisions, in particular, 
plays an especially important role in ensuring public trust in the judiciary. 
III. Generalized privacy interests cannot support sealing. 

The district court’s decision focused on “the privacy rights of individuals,” 


citing caselaw related to, inter alia, the Fourth Amendment, Freedom of 


17 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page29 of 49 


Information Act, and trade secrets. Sp.A.-16—19. But broad, general notions of 
privacy are not enough to demonstrate either a “higher value” that overcomes the 
First Amendment presumption of access, see Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court, 
478 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1986) (“Press-Enterprise IT’), or a “substantial interest” that 
overcomes the common law presumption of access, Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 
F. Supp. 3d 460, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). 

The First Amendment right of access requires that judicial documents may 
be sealed only if and to the extent that “specific, on the record findings . . . 


999 


demonstrat[e] that ‘closure is essential to preserve higher values[.|’” Press- 
Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 13-14 (quoting Press Enterprise I, 464 U.S. at 510). 
“Broad and general findings” by the district court “are not sufficient to justify 
closure.” In re N.Y. Times Co., 828 F.2d 110, 116 (2d Cir. 1987). 

As an initial matter, as the Miami Herald notes, the alleged victim of sexual 
abuse and trafficking in this case, Ms. Giuffre, who is now an adult, has advocated 
for unsealing all of the records in this case. See Br. and Special App. for 
Intervenors-Appellants at 22 (citing A.-428). In addition, the revelation of 
information related to sexual assault of minors does not automatically create a 
compelling interest that overcomes the First Amendment or common law rights of 


access, as the district court erroneously concluded. Sp.A.-38—40. For example, in 


Globe Newspapers, the Supreme Court struck down a Massachusetts statute that 
18 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page30 of 49 


automatically closed court proceedings during the testimony of minor victims of 
sexual offenses, concluding that whether the First Amendment presumption of 
access had been overcome must be determined on a case-by-case basis. 457 U.S. 
at 608-09. 

Here, generalized privacy interests of the alleged victims and perpetrators of 
sexual abuse and trafficking cannot overcome the public’s strong interest in access. 


IV. The district court failed to make an independent determination 
regarding the sealing of specific records. 


This Court has made clear that it is “improper” for a district court “to 
delegate its authority” regarding the sealing of judicial records to litigants; a 
district court must “make its own redactions, supported by specific findings, after a 
careful review of all claims for and against access.” United States v. Amodeo, 44 
F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Amodeo I’). Here, the district court permitted the 
parties to make redactions to the Summary Judgment Documents based on the 
parties’ determinations as to what information should be kept from the press and 
the public. See Sp.A.-32 (stating that certain portions of the Summary Judgment 
Documents “reveal[] the substance of the evidence jointly deemed confidential by 
the parties. It was therefore redacted by the parties”). In denying the Miami 
Herald’s motion to unseal the Summary Judgment Documents, the district court 


simply accepted the parties’ decisions regarding redactions without any indication 
ply p p g g y 


19 


Case 18-2868, Document 68, 12/17/2018, 2457074, Page31 of 49 


that it had conducted an independent, particularized review of the propriety of 
those redactions. See id. at 33-35. 

The First Amendment required the district court to evaluate each specific 
portion of the Summary Judgment Documents that the parties redacted to 
determine if the presumption of access was overcome. See Press-Enterprise I, 464 
U.S. at 510 (stating that a lower court must articulate an overriding interest “along 
with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the 
closure order was properly entered”). There is no indication that the district court 
did so. The district court merely found that the Summary Judgment Documents, in 
general, discuss allegations of sexual assault and sexual trafficking of minors—a 
conclusory finding that does not justify keeping any specific portion of any 
document under seal. 

In addition, the district court ignored the Miami Herald’s motion to unseal 
Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to intervene and the order denying that motion. Just as 
the district court was required to undertake an individualized analysis of the 
redactions to the Summary Judgment Documents that were made by the parties, it 
should also have considered whether an overriding or substantial interest justified 


sealing Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to intervene and the order denying that motion.

CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons and those set forth in the Miami Herald’s brief, 
amici curiae urge this Court to reverse the district court’s order denying access to 
judicial documents in this case.
