The Year in Genetics
 
2018 was inspiring, illuminating and entertaining...and that was just the world of genetics.
 
Before we welcome 2019, let’s take a look back at some of the headlines and the highlights that made 2018 a year to remember.
 
 
JANUARY
 
23andMe study turned data points into zzz’s.
 
We began the year by sharing the results from our first-ever interventional Sleep Study. More than 6,600 participants were asked to make as many as three lifestyle changes to improve their quality of sleep. Overall, they reported better sleep quality at the end of the study than at the start.

FEBRUARY
 
Billions of base pairs of data, in their pocket.
 
This is big. For the first time ever, an international team of scientists was able to sequence and assemble the human genome using a pocket-sized sequencer made by Oxford Nanopore. Scientists say advances in DNA sequencing technology will allow them to sequence larger chunks of DNA than ever before. No small development.

MARCH
 
23andMe received FDA authorization for first ever direct-to-consumer genetic test for cancer risk.
 
23andMe became the first company authorized to provide hereditary cancer risk information without a doctor’s prescription in the U.S. Our BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants) report* tests for three genetic variants that are associated with increased risk for breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. Making this kind of test directly available to consumers is a huge milestone in empowering people to be in control of their own health information.

MAY
 
Foundation is laid for new era of precision medicine.

The right treatments, at the right time, for the right people. That’s the promise of precision medicine. On May 6, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) opened national enrollment for All of Us, a groundbreaking research program that seeks to advance personalized prevention and treatment for people of all backgrounds. By factoring in differences in people’s lifestyles, environments and genetic makeups, researchers hope to take a significant step toward realizing the promise of customized care.

JUNE
 
Hangry much? 23andMe study explored the genetic link between mood and food. 

We might think “feeling hangry” starts with an empty stomach, but this maddening sensation could be influenced by our genes. More than 100,000 people responded to a 23andMe survey exploring the connection between feelings of hunger and irritability. The results suggest that “hangriness” may owe its origins not simply to skipping breakfast, but to genes that are associated with our personalities and mental health.

JULY
 
New collaboration redefines how we discover novel medicines in the future.

23andMe’s mission has always been to help people access, understand and benefit from the human genome. Our collaboration with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will advance our ability to do just that. We believe that our genetic research, coupled with GSK’s expertise in drug development and discovery, will accelerate the development of novel cures and treatments inspired by genetic insights.

AUGUST
 
You care about privacy. We do, too.
 
At 23andMe, we believe everyone deserves a secure, private place to explore and understand their genetics. We were proud to join forces with the Future of Privacy Forum and our fellow industry leaders in helping to develop a series of best practices for the collection, protection, sharing and use of genetic data. It’s your data. Our job is to protect it.

SEPTEMBER
 
New iHeart Radio podcast with 23andMe offered fresh perspectives on what connects us.
 
John Legend on DNA and identity. Wyclef Jean on genetics and empowerment. Produced by iHeartRadio and hosted by the writer, comedian and cultural critic Baratunde Thurston, this entertaining and informative new podcast offers unscripted conversations on how DNA testing is changing the way we think about identity, family and race. Trust us. It’s the spit.

OCTOBER
 
23andMe granted FDA authorization for direct-to-consumer pharmacogenetics reports.
 
Another month, another first-of-its-kind FDA authorization. In October, 23andMe was granted authorization by the FDA to offer reports to customers on pharmacogenetics, which indicate how their genetics may influence the way they metabolize certain medications. This is just the latest step in our ongoing quest to give consumers genetic insights they can use to take charge of their health.

DECEMBER
 
Scientists take steps toward the creation of a detailed model of the brain’s genetic landscape.

A Google Earth for the brain? That's the goal of a new $50 million effort to create a model of the brain’s genetic landscape. This research effort, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, recently published its first results and hopes to gain a better understanding of the genetics of autism, schizophrenia and other brain disorders.

*The 23andMe PGS test uses qualitative genotyping to detect select clinically relevant variants in the genomic DNA of adults from saliva for the purpose of reporting and interpreting genetic health risks, including the 23andMe PGS Genetic Health Risk Report for BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants). Your ethnicity may affect the relevance of each report and how your genetic health risk results are interpreted. The test is not intended to diagnose any disease and does not describe a person's overall risk of developing any type of cancer. It is not intended to tell you anything about your current state of health, or to be used to make medical decisions, including whether or not you should take a
 medication, how much of a medication you should take, or determine any treatments. Warnings & Limitations: The 23andMe PGS Genetic Health RIsk Report for BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants) is indicated for reporting of the 185delAG and 5382insC variants in the BRCA1 gene and the 6174delT variant in the BRCA2 gene. The report describes if a woman is at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and if a man is at increased risk of developing breast cancer or may be at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. The three variants included in this report are most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and do not represent the majority of BRCA1/BRCA2 variants in the general
 population. This report does not include variants in other genes linked to hereditary cancers and the absence of variants included in this report does not rule out the presence of other genetic variants that may impact cancer risk. The PGS test is not a substitute for visits to a healthcare professional for recommended screenings or appropriate follow-up. Results should be confirmed in a clinical setting before taking any medical action.You are receiving this email because you are a customer of 23andMe.

That's the goal of a new $50 million effort to create a model of the brain’s genetic landscape. This research effort, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, recently published its first results and hopes to gain a better understanding of the genetics of autism, schizophrenia and other brain disorders.

<br>*The 23andMe PGS test uses qualitative genotyping to detect select clinically relevant variants in the genomic DNA of adults from saliva for the purpose of reporting and interpreting genetic health risks, including the 23andMe PGS Genetic Health Risk Report for BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants). Your ethnicity may affect the relevance of each report and how your genetic health risk results are interpreted. The test is not intended to diagnose any disease and does not describe a person's overall risk of developing any type of cancer. It is not intended to tell you anything about your current state of health, or to be used to make medical decisions, including whether or not you should take
 a medication, how much of a medication you should take, or determine any treatments. <strong>Warnings & Limitations:
</strong> The 23andMe PGS Genetic Health RIsk Report for BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants) is indicated for reporting of the 185delAG and 5382insC variants in the BRCA1 gene and the 6174delT variant in the BRCA2 gene. The report describes if a woman is at increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and if a man is at increased risk of developing breast cancer or may be at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. The three variants included in this report are most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and do not represent the majority of BRCA1/BRCA2 variants in the general population. This report does not include variants in other genes linked to hereditary cancers and
 the absence of variants included in this report does not rule out the presence of other genetic variants that may impact cancer risk. The PGS test is not a substitute for visits to a healthcare professional for recommended screenings or appropriate follow-up. Results should be confirmed in a clinical setting before taking any medical action.You are receiving this email because you are a customer of 23andMe.<br class="em_hide" /><br />
