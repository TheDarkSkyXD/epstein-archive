# 📖 Wiki User Guide (For End Users)

## 🔍 How to Search Effectively
The archive contains over 100,000 documents. Use these filters to find what you need:
- **Red Flag Rating**: Filter for "4-5" to find documents with the most investigative significance.
- **Source Collection**: Focus on "Estate Emails" for post-2009 context or "Flight Logs" for transit data.
- **Date Range**: Use the Timeline view to see documents released during specific unsealing events.

## 📄 Viewing Original Documents
When viewing a document, click the **"View Original"** tab.
- This will show a side-by-side view of the extracted text and the original PDF.
- If the document is part of a multi-page file, the viewer will attempt to jump to the correct page automatically.

## 👥 Understanding Person Cards
Person cards summarize an individual's presence in the archive:

## 🛡️ Privacy & Reliability
- **"AI Generated" / "Fake" Tags**: The media gallery automatically filters out known fraudulent or high-risk AI-generated content.
- **Redaction**: Some documents contain black bars. We cannot "see through" these; the text reflects what was legally released.
- **Disclaimer**: Inclusion in the archive does not imply guilt. This is a research tool for public records.
