BY THE NUMBERS

The fate of the stock market's hot streak could rest with today's economic reports and earnings. The government releases June housing starts at 8:30 a.m. ET. Among this afternoon's earnings reports, in addition to Microsoft, are results from United (UAL) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).
Actively managed U.S. stock funds posted an estimated $21.7 billion in outflows in June, the largest retreat since October 2008, 
https://click.response.cnbc.com/?qs=900cb8e4b025c3887db14c0f374e6f2e19703e1bb90ca5f7eba8a6dcf78a3fc807880949698bdb0e 
according to Morningstar . All active groups, except muni bonds, suffered outflows. By contrast, all passive groups, except alternatives, saw inflows. STOCKS TO WATCH

Novartis (NVS) said full-year profit may decline due to increased marketing spending by the drug maker for its new heart failure drug Entresto. Novartis did report better than expected earnings for its latest quarter, but initial sales for Entresto were lower than expected.Ericsson (ERIC) announced more cost-cutting moves, following weaker than expected second quarter profit. The telecom equipment maker, looking to increase efficiency, said its latest moves were aimed at doubling its savings in operating expenses.Regulatory filings show Viacom (VIAB) CEO Philippe Dauman and COO Thomas Dooley are reserving their right to resign if a judge approves founder Sumner Redstone's move to remove five directors, including Dauman, but not Dooley.
