Hello from Amazon.com.

We're contacting you about the e-mail we sent you about newly released Blu-ray titles. After the e-mail was sent yesterday, we realized we'd made a mistake.

The prices of Madden NFL 09 and Soul Calibur IV were listed incorrectly in our e-mail. The correct prices are listed on our site. If you click the links for these two games in the e-mail message we sent yesterday, you'll see the correct prices.

We sincerely apologize for this error. Thank you for shopping at Amazon.com.

Sincerely,
Customer Service
