Dear Yahoo! Mail Plus user,

We have important news for Yahoo! Mail Plus subscribers who are
currently using our "POP" feature  to send messages via external
email clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express,
Thunderbird, Apple Mail, etc. (also called "SMTP access"). If you are
accessing your Yahoo! Mail Plus exclusively through our Web
interface, this message does not apply to you.

Recently, we saw an unexpected increase in traffic through the
servers dedicated to sending Yahoo! Mail Plus POP/SMTP messages. As a
result, some users have experienced varying delays in the delivery of
Yahoo! Mail messages sent via external email clients. We understand
that this has been frustrating, and sincerely apologize for the
inconvenience.

WHAT HAS CHANGED?

We have recently installed new servers to improve the performance of
Yahoo! Mail Plus SMTP access. We have spent the last several days
upgrading our hardware and restructuring the allocation of bandwidth
for these servers. We are confident these changes will resolve the
recent problems and increase our system's reliability.

Because of these improvements, the settings for your outgoing mail
server (SMTP) should change.

WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

To ensure that your email client is properly configured to access the
new outgoing mail servers (SMTP), please follow these brief steps:

1. Sign in to your Yahoo! Mail Plus account
2. Go to "Mail Options" --> "POP access" --> "View POP settings"
3. Review the updated settings in "POP Access Settings"
4. If needed, set your email client to the new server:
plus.smtp.mail.yahoo.com

Or follow these detailed instructions to update your Mail Plus SMTP
settings:
http://yahoo-email.com/a/tBHyOGzBPQv4VB0on4KB02Hu03j/pop

Please check the Yahoo! Mail Blog at
http://yahoo-email.com/a/tBHyOGzBPQv4VB0on4KB02Hu03j/blog
for frequent updates on this and many other Yahoo! Mail topics.

We deeply value and appreciate your continued business.

Thank you,

John Kremer
Vice President, Yahoo! Mail
