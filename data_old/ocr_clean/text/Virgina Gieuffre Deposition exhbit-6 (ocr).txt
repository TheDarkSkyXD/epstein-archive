EXAMINATION BY
MS. MCCAWLEY:
Good morning. I'm going to explain
some of the rules that will happen with
respect to depositions.
Have you ever been deposed before?
A. I have not.
l. What is going to happen here, we
have a court reporter and a videographer.
What they do is take down the words that we
say so when I ask you a question they will
record what you say in response to that. So
we have to be mindful that in order for them
to do their job we can't talk over each
other.
Another issue you have to be weary

of is that in a response, you can't give a
nonverbal response, in other words, nodding a
yes or no, they need to hear verbal response
so they can record it on their transcript.
So that's important for you to remember as we
go through the day. If you forget, I will be
sure to remind you.
Is there anything that would
prevent you from giving truthful testimony
today?
A.
There is not.
You are not on any medications or
anything that would inhibit your ability to
remember or give truthful testimony?
A.
I am not.
MR. PAGLIUCA: Could you identify
the assistant in the room.
MS. McCAWLEY: This is Emma Rosen

MR. PAGLIUCA: Maybe we should get

it.
MR. EDWARDS: The record will be
short. This is the precise reason why
Ms. Giuffre wants me in this case and
I'm unable to effectively represent her
at this time because I am unable to have
access to the confidential information
which includes apparently the entire
deposition of Ms. Maxwell. But for the
sake of not further delaying this, I

MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you.

Of course. I just wanted to be

that he had but much more importantly, most
of the houses had construction and so whilst
in 1992 there was no construction project,
there was construction projects that began
after that time and I was in charge not only
of hiring architects, I was also in charge of
all the filings or overseeing that, like a
general contractor would.
I also helped with hiring the
architects, hiring the builders, reviewing
the contracts for the builders, coordinating
the building projects, coordinating how the
projects would layout, the timing of the
projects and all the various materials that
they would require to run a very substantial

you not to answer that question. I
don't have any problem with you asking
questions about what the subject matter
of this lawsuit is, which would be, as
you've termed it, sexual trafficking of
Ms. Roberts.
To the extent you are asking for
information relating to any consensual
adult interaction between my client and
Mr. Epstein, I'm going to instruct her
not to answer because it's not part of
this litigation and it is her private
confidential information, not subject to
this deposition.
MS. McCAWLEY: You can instruct her
not to answer. That is your right. But
I will bring her back for another
deposition because it is part of the
subject matter of this litigation so she
should be answering these questions.
This is civil litigation, deposition and
she should be responsible for answering
these questions.
MR. PAGLIUCA: I disagree and you

Did you ever participate from the
time period of 1992 to 2009, did you ever
participate in a massage with Jeffrey Epstein

MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection. Do not
answer that question. Again, to the

illegal activity as you've construed in
connection with this case I don't have
any problem with you asking that
question. To the extent these questions
involve consensual acts between adults,
frankly, they're none of your business

to you interrupting the witness who was
answering your question. The question
was,
have you ever seen anyone, female
under the age of 18 at the house and
that's the question she was answering.
If you want to strike that question and
ask another question, feel free, but let
the witness respond, please.
MS. McCAWLEY: I will do that.
l.
Have you ever observed a female
under the age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's home
that was not a friend, a child - one of your
friend's children?
A.
Again, I can't testify to that
because I have no idea what you are talking
about.
You have no idea what I'm talking

friend's children, is that correct?

everyone who came to his house was an adult

You will see some redactions in

the name of a minor,
someone who is under the
age of 18.
On page 28, in the third paragraph,
about halfway down, it says,

conclusion of this massage, Epstein paid
$200 for the massage.

You can answer. It's yes or no.

asked Virginia to recruit females and the
first part of your question, if you can
repeat that again, the question you asked.

Will you read back the question.

Let me ask my question, I have a
question pending right now.
Are you testifying that you are
unaware of any underage, under the age of 18,
females coming to Jeffrey Epstein's home to
perform massages?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form

A.
You need to straddle that question
in a different time period. When I was
there, at the time I was present, the people
that gave Jeffrey, men and women who gave
Jeffrey massages were adults over the age of
18.
e.
Never in your time at any of
Jeffrey Epstein's homes were you present when
a female under the age of 18 was there to
give Jeffrey Epstein a massage?

I cannot answer yes or no, it's not

I would not know.
How would I know when
somebody was in the house. There is no way I

in the back of the home, in other words
without a
shirt on?
A. So that's just another of
Virginia's lies. So let's be clear, at the
time when I was there and present, frequently
at the house, it was unusual to see people
without their clothes on.
When you say unusual, did you
observe people without their clothes at
Jeffrey Espstein's home?
A.
Can I answer. Sometimes people in
the privacy of a house and swimming pool, I
have seen people from time to time take their
top off. I have seen people from time to
time do that. Very unusual. Naked people
around the people at any frequent period of
time, I have never seen.
Were they under the age of 18?
A.
As I was saying, people when I was
in the house, were of adult age, if they were
children, friends of my family or friends
that were there, they may well have been
because I have nieces and nephews under the
age of 18, I cannot testify to anybody else

-- just another one of Virginia's many
fictitious
lies and stories to make this a
salacious event to get interest and press.
It's absolute rubbish.
Were you in charge of hiring
individuals to provide massages for Jeffrey
Epstein?
A.
My job included hiring many people.
There were six homes. As I sit here, I hired
assistants, I hired architects, I hired
decorators, I hired cooks, I hired cleaners,
I hired gardeners, I hired pool people, I
hired pilots, I hired all sorts of people.
In the course and a very small part
of my job was from from time to time to find
adult professional massage therapists for
Jeffrey.
When you say adult professional
massage therapists, where did you find these
massage therapists?
A.
From time to time I would visit
professional spas, I would receive a massage
and if the massage was good I would ask that
man or woman if they did home visits.

Again, I don't hire massage
therapists, so that was not my job.
e. You just said you did, you just
said you hired massage therapists for Jeffrey
Epstein, I'm asking if you hired a massage
therapist who was under the age of 18?
A.
Let me correct myself. When I
meant hire, I didn't mean hire in the way you
are doing it. What I say is that I went to
spas and I met people and if they did home
visits, Jeffrey would then, in fact, hire
them.
I'm not responsible for hiring
someone.
And they were not full-time, so
it's not a correct characterization.

First of all, Virginia Roberts who
you are referring to was a masseuse aged 17,
we all now know, so your story that you keep
pushing out to the press that she was a 15
year old - you and I both know was a lie,
correct.
2. You are not sentencing my question.
A.
You and I both know that was a lie,
correct.
2. You are not answering my question.
I'm asking you whether you ever met a female
under the age of 18 that Jeffrey then hired
as a masseuse?

A.
The only person I can talk about
who clearly was a massage age 17, a masseuse,

healthcare provider you can earn somewhere
between as we have established 100 to $200

pays that is a wonderful job opportunity. So

Do you recall Virginia Roberts
calling you because she was having a medical
crisis and you and Jeffrey taking her to the
hospital?
A.
I have heard this absurd story and
if any part of it were true I would remember
that.
I do not.
You don't remember taking her to
the hospital?
A.
it didn't happen.
l.
It's not that I don't remember it,
How do you know it didn't happen?
A.
That's the sort of memory you would

Do you recall, you said you don't

When you were in New York would you stay at
the New York mansion with Jeffrey?
A.
I stayed from time to time.
Do you recall Virginia being at the
New York mansion when

A. Are you asking me if any foreigner,
not an American person, gave Jeffrey a
massage?
e.
Yes.
A. Well, as I sit here today, I can't
think of anyone who is foreign. Certainly --
I just can't think of anybody right this
second.
How about any foreign girls who
were under the age of 18?
A. I already testified to not knowing
anything about underage girls.
l.
Were there foreign girls who were
brought to Jeffrey's home by

MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
form and foundation.
A. I am not aware of
bringing
girls.
I have not no idea what you are
talking about.
You have never been around foreign
girls who are under the age of 18 at
Jeffrey's homes?

it Jeffrey's

I think you should ask that

A.
Do you know?
I don't believe that was his

A. I think you do.

And did Jeffrey know your father?

No.
How were you introduced to Jeffrey?
Some friend introduced us.

1991?
A.
It was just friendly.
Then I believe you testified you

correct?
A.
Yes.
e.
In 1992 I know you gave me the

you, do you remember?

message?
A. I do not recall this message.
l. Do you recall training a female

2. Do you believe Jeffrey Epstein
sexually abused minors?

Again, I repeat, the only person I
know who has talked about these things that I
have personal -- was personally present, was
Virginia and I can only talk to Virginia and
she is a liar.

Setting aside Virginia. Take her

A.
We are here today because of

Setting aside Virginia, do you
believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused
minors?
A.
I cannot set aside Virginia because
that's why we are here and this is the only
reason I am sitting here in this room and I

about anything else except her because she is
the only person I actually know about.

She lied about her age, you know she lied
about absolutely everything. So I can only
go on what I know as a liar and she is a
liar, an exaggerator, a fantasist and
absolutely true terrible person.
I want you to listen very
carefully. I am asking you to set aside

I am asking you to do that for

What I'm asking you is whether you
believe Jeffrey Epstein abused minors?
MR. PAGLIUCA: I object to the form
and you made your record, she answered
the question. A fair reading of her
answer is she doesn't have a belief
because she doesn't have any personal
knowledge.
MS. McCAWLEY: Now you are
testifying for the witness. Let her
answer the question.
MR. PAGLIUCA: It's a fair answer
to the question.
A.
Again, I testified my only personal
knowledge concerns Virginia and everything
Virginia has said is an absolute lie, which
is why we are here in this room.
If you are
asking me to testify about things I have no
knowledge of other than the police report
that you showed me, I am not in a position to
make a statement based on that because you
are asking me to speculate and I cannot
speculate.
I'm asking you about your belief.

lies
I cannot speculate on what anybody else
did or didn't do because if Virginia is the
example of what that story is and everything
she said is false, so everything that leads
from that is false.
So the 30 other minor children in
the police report are also telling lies about
being sexually abused during massages with
Mr. Epstein?

actual knowledge is with Virginia and
Virginia is a liar, so I can only talk to
what Virginia's story and as I said before
and there are so many examples, I mean
thousands of examples of her lies, that that
is the only thing I can talk to.
Based on that you do not believe
that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?
A. Again, as I said, I'm only talking
to what I know, I can only talk to Virginia.

So is it your belief that Jeffrey
Epstein did not sexually abuse minors?
A. Again, I can only talk to what I
know and I know that Virginia is a liar and
that what she said is a lie. So I can only
testify to what she accused and you guys put
in the press for salacious purposes and
whatever terrible, inappropriate, unethical

guilty?

I'm a very loyal person and Jeffrey
was very good to me when my father passed
away and I believe that you need to be a good
friend in people's hour of need and I felt
that it was a very thoughtful, nice thing for
me to do to help in very limited fashion
which was helping if he had any issue with
his homes, in terms of the staffing issues.
It was very, very minor but I felt it was
thoughtful in somebody's hour of need.

between anyone under the age of 18 and over
the age of 18.
We will start with, did you take
pictures of nude females in or around any of
Jeffrey's homes of women or females that were
under the age of 18?
A.
No.
l. Did you take pictures of nude
females --
A.
Nude you mean with no clothing on.
l.
Or half nude, with no top on, any
sort of nakedness to an individual.
In any of Jeffrey's homes, either
Palm Beach, New Mexico, USVI or New York
either outside by the pool, anywhere in or
around those homes of females over the age of
18?
A.
So it is possible that I took
pictures of people that were somehow semi or
had some clothing on or no clothes on but at
no time were any of these pictures remotely
inappropriate.
They were, you could see them

a picture you could put on your - gift to

It would be a very

Who would request those pictures?
A.
From time to time, people, men and

them taken.
And did Jeffrey Epstein request
those pictures?
A. I don't ever recall him asking me
to take pictures.
Did you give him pictures of naked

I don't recall ever giving a

The original allegations are
not new and have been fully responded to and
shown to be untrue. And the next paragraph
says, Each time the story is retold, it
changes with new salacious details about
public figures and world leaders and now it
is alleged by Ms. Roberts that

her which he denies.
Ms. Roberts claims are

The last paragraph states,
Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the
lies and defamatory claims remains the same.

The characterization that she said

worked at Mar-a-Lago, she would have been

impossible to identify her as someone other
than
someone who worked at a spa. She made
many claims, she has been a bathroom
attendant, front of house attendant, we don't
know what she was, so her obvious lies are
her contradictory of her own personal
statements within that.

A. I'm carrying on.
l. I'm sorry. I thought you were
done.
A. Please. Her statement also that
she was driven by her father to Palm Beach.
She was driven by her mother, as a matter of
fact. Her whole entire characterization of
the first meeting with Jeffrey, as I was
outside speaking to her mother.
l.
Let me stop you there, so we don't
get too far ahead. Let me make sure I
understand your testimony.
The first, in the first piece when
you were talking, I believe you said and
correct me if I'm wrong, that her
characterization of the first meeting at
Mar-a-Lago was an obvious lie.
What part of that meeting was an
obvious lie?
A.
By her own testimony, all her
various many different descriptions of what
she was or wasn't or where she was or wasn't,
they have all changed.
She was either front
of house or bathroom attendant.

what she was, so just by her own words, one
doesn't know what's true and what isn't true.
Are you saying what position she
said she was working in, is that what you are
considering the obvious lie?
A.
I said inconsistency within her own
statement from everything, so in the
beginning it starts off with different
statements.
l.
Then I believe you said the second
piece was that she was driven by her father?
A.
I said she was driven by her
mother.
e.
That's the obvious lie?
A.
It's an obvious lie to me.
e.
You said why don't you state it in
your own words but the characterization of
how she was with Jeffrey, what about that is
an obvious lie?
A.
I was standing outside talking to
her mother so the entire story is a
fabrication.
Did she not have sex with Jeffrey
Epstein during that first massage?

MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

A. I was talking to her mother so...
l. Do you know whether that's an
obvious lie, whether she had sex in that room
or not?
A. Her story about what happened --
let's also be -- the story as first hit the
press was that somebody else led her to
Jeffrey's room, it was not me and then it
turned to being me so we have an obviously
important inconsistency, lie in my -- that's
how I would characterize a lie. It cannot be
me or somebody else, it can only be one or
the other.

not say it was me and be done with it.

It's obviously inconsistent to

you're saying she walked in and would have

have gone and talked to Jeffrey and left?
A.
When I was working for Jeffrey,
typically he would meet someone before
getting a massage from them to see if he
wanted to have a massage from them,
typically.
So he would not have someone come

You can be a professional masseuse

A.
No. I did not state that at all,
you are mischaracterizing my words and what I
said.
What I said was that we can all
agree and I think at this point there is not
one person in this room, however much you
would like her to be younger, to say she was
not 17 because that has been a very offensive
thing that you have all done. So she was 17.
At 17 you are allowed to be a professional
masseuse and as far as I'm concerned, she was
a professional masseuse. There is nothing
inappropriate or incorrect about her coming
at that time to give a massage. Her entire
characterization of her first time at the
house was
to me an obvious lie, given it was
impossible for her entire story to take place
given I was speaking to her mother the entire
she was
at the house.
So it was
impossible that day, that
first day she came and you were speaking to
the mother, for Virginia Roberts to have had
sex with Jeffrey Epstein during the time that
you were outside with her mother?

Roberts is.
l.
Did he tell you that he didn't have
sex with her?
A.
It would be difficult to have sex
with someone you don't know.
e.
He may not remember her?
A. I think the inference is he didn't

recollection of her whatsoever.

Yes.

Q. If you have more.
A. I have -- her entire
characterization -- I took her shopping into
Burberry and bought her a very expensive
dress and if this photo were real and if this
is -- I would never -- the outfit doesn't
work at all so --
Do you not remember taking her
shopping or are you saying it's an obvious

I did not take her shopping. I did
not by her a $5,000 handbag.
Did Jeffrey by her a $5,000
handbag?
A.
Her accusation was that I did.

Do you know if Jeffrey bought her a

Jeffrey enjoyed getting massages. I think
that is something we can all agree in this

infrequently I would go to spas and myself
happily receive a professional nonsexual
massage from a man and/or from a woman and if
that massage was something that I thought was

MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

A. I can't recollect a time when
-- I've seen
with Jeffrey but --
You are not sure --
A. I know they know either other. I
can't testify to a meeting between them.
Do you know where in New Jersey she
lives?
A.
No
You don't know a city?
A.
No.
How long has she worked for you?
A.
e.
Sometime 2002, 2003.
To the present?
A.
Yeah.
Why do you think that

MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

A. Because you know, I know Jeffrey.
l. Have you seen them together?
A.
I already testified I have not seen
them together, to my recollection.

Did you authorize

A. I already testified that that was
done by my lawyers.

So did you authorize your lawyers
to issue a statement on your behalf through

A.
It was determined that I had to
make a statement in the United Kingdom
because of the appalling lies and I just
thought of some new
ones.
Virginia's statement that I
celebrated her 16 birthday with her. We can
all agree that that's entirely impossible. I
didn't meet her until she was 17 and other
lies she perpetrated that she had a diary and
we all know is a complete fake. That's not a
diary. It was just a book she was writing

That would be sex for hire, any

believe you said all of us would know that
Virginia was 17 at the time you met her.

dates, now that it was in 2000, so her entire
tail of me celebrating her 16th birthday is
clearly another giant falsehood.
But she was 16 and 17 that year,

MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the

A. That's not how I would characterize
that.
How would you characterize it?
A. I have testified that I'm
responsible for finding professional people
to work in the homes, age appropriate adult
people, so from pool attendants, to
gardeners, to chefs, to housekeepers, to
butlers, to chauffeurs and one of the
functions was to be able to answer the
telephones and in the context of finding
someone to answer the telephones, I did look
to try to find appropriate people to answer
the phones.
e.
So did you find Johanna for
purposes of that role?
A.
So in the course of looking for
somebody to answer phones at the house,
Johanna was one of the people who said that
she was willing to answer phones.
Did you approach her at her school
campus?

A. I don't know who has this document.
What's your basis in that statement
for saying Ms. Roberts fled the U.S.?

what in 2011 exactly the basis of that
statement was.
So you don't know whether or not
that statement is true?
A. This is in 2011 and it never went

with Virginia Roberts.
I'm marking this as Maxwell 25.
(Maxwell Exhibit 25, email, marked
for identification.)
I'm showing you what has been
marked as Maxwell 25.
This is an email dated January 11,
2015 at the top?
Do you see that that from Jeffrey
to you?
A.
Uh-huh.
And then below there is an email
to you and cc'ing
from
on January 11, 2015.
Do you see that?
A.
Uh-huh.
It says, Dear Ghislaine, as you
know I have been working behind the scenes
and this article comes from that. It helps
but doesn't answer the VR claims. I will get
the criminal allegations out. This shows the
MOS will print truth, not just a VR voice
piece.
We can only make the truth by making
a statement.
