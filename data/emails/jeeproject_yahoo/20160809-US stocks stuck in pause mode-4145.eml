The National Federation of Independent Business will issue its July index of small business sentiment, seen coming in at 94.6.That would be barely changed from June's 94.5 reading. At 8:30 a.m. ET, the government will report on second-quarter productivity, expected to register a 0.4 percent annual rate increase following the first quarter's 0.6 percent slide. Economists think June wholesale inventories will be higher by 0.1 percent when the report comes out at 10 a.m. ET. That would match the May increase. Luxury goods maker Coach (COH) is among the handful of companies out with quarterly earnings this morning, along with Charter Communications (CHTR) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH).Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) is today's after-the-bell earnings headliner, with Fossil (FOSL), Mylan
 (MYL), The Container Store (TCS), WageWorks (WAGE), and Yelp (YELP) also scheduled to report. 
STOCKS TO WATCH

BP (BP) is looking for buyers for its 50-percent stake in SECCO, a China-based petrochemicals joint venture, according to a Reuters report. The stake could fetch as much as $3 billion.
LendingClub (LC) reported an adjusted second-quarter loss of 9 cents per share, wider than the 2 cents expected by analysts, though revenue was slightly ahead of forecasts. The operator of an online lending marketplace also announced the resignation of Chief Financial Officer Carrie Dolan.News Corp (NWSA) reported an adjusted quarterly profit of 10 cents per share, 3 cents shy of estimates, though its revenue did exceed analyst forecasts. The unexpected rise in revenue compared to a year earlier was helped by results for its newspapers, which include the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, as well as better results in its digital real estate operation.Twilio (TWLO) lost an adjusted 8 cents per share for its latest quarter, 6 cents less than analysts had anticipated, and the company's
 revenue was well above estimates. The maker of messaging and voice services also gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter as demand for its services rises.Gap (GPS) posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly sales, but its July comparable sales are below Street estimates. Results were particularly weak at Banana Republic, although Old Navy is showing signs of recovering. Following those results, Mizuho upgraded the stock to "neutral" from "underperform," noting easier comparisons ahead as well as cost controls and favorable currency fluctuations.
